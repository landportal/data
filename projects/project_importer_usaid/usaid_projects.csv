,Property Rights and Artisanal Diamond Development II: Côte d’Ivoire,"<p>The <b>Property Rights and Artisanal Diamond Development (PRADD) II</b> program will build on the successes of the predecessor <a href=""/project/property-rights-and-artisanal-diamond-development-central-african-republic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">PRADD</a> project that was implemented under the Property Rights and Resource Governance Task Order. PRADD and PRADD II were developed to support country compliance with the <a href=""http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kimberley Process</a> (KP), “a joint governments, industry and civil society initiative to stem the flow of conflict diamonds – rough diamonds used by rebel movements to finance wars against legitimate governments.”</p>
<p>The overarching goal of PRADD and PRADD II are to increase the percentage of diamonds entering the legal chain of custody, while improving the livelihoods of artisanal diamond mining communities. PRADD II is financed through a Congressional Earmark in support of the Clean Diamond Trade Act and managed by USAID’s Land Tenure and Property Rights Division within the E3 Bureau. The LTPR Division closely coordinates with the US Department of State and US Geological Survey who also provide support to the KPCS.</p>
<p>PRADD II will continue to be a landmark program for the United States Government (USG), the Kimberley Process and the development community at large. PRADD was one of the first and largest development projects concentrated on the Kimberley Process and artisanal diamond mining challenges. Significantly, PRADD has been instrumental in helping the KPCS modify its goals from a narrow focus on traceability, regulation and enforcement systems to a broader focus recognizing the role of economic development in bringing rough diamonds into legitimate chains of custody, and consequently better addressing the challenges of conflict diamonds. This transition is demonstrated by the recent adoption of the <a href=""/sites/default/files/Washington_Declaration_Kimberley_Process_Implementation.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Washington Declaration</a> at the 2012 Kimberley Process Plenary meetings that occurred in November in Washington, DC. Due to the limited number of development institutions and experiences in the artisanal mining sector, PRADD II will continue to test and evaluate approaches to achieving its objectives while also consolidating program successes, to encourage other donors and governments to implement PRADD-type programs to achieve KPCS objectives.</p>

,Addressing Biodiversity-Social Conflict in Latin America,"<p>The overall goal of the U.S. Government in providing technical support and training under the <b> Addressing Biodiversity-Social Conflict in Latin America (ABC-LA) </b> program is to improve indigenous/minority community and local/regional governmental capacities to better address conflicts (potential and on-going) in the extractives sector that may negatively impact areas of significant biodiversity, thus leading to greater inclusion of marginalized groups. Inclusion encompasses indigenous/minority communities active participation in the decision making processes of planned, or on-going, extractive enterprises that have the potential to negatively impact their lands, societies, livelihoods, and biodiversity. Enhancing the ability of people, communities, and local/regional governments to address complicated issues surrounding extractive activities directly works towards USAID’s mission to (1) build local sustainability and partnerships, (2) foster innovation, and (3) strengthen USAID’s capacity to deliver results. Extractive activities primarily refer to mining (alluvial and hard-rock) and hydrocarbon enterprises. A key focus of this project will be strengthening organizations, including applied research centers that work on preventing and mitigating conflicts arising over extractive activities. Developing and disseminating applicable tools for improved conflict management is a project priority.</p>
<p>Select South and Central American countries have been identified as priorities for USAID conflict alleviation work in the LA region; this project will therefore focus primarily on these LA sub-regions. During the first two years of project implementation, the project will focus on Guatemala, Colombia and Peru; complementing LA bilateral Mission work in the area of conflict management.</p>",,2013,2015,USD 1300000,https://www.land-links.org/project/addressing-biodiversity-social-conflict-in-latin-america/,GTM;PER,USAID,"Land Use, Management & Investment","Land Conflicts;Land, Climate change & Environment",land conflicts;sustainable land management;climate change;land governance;environment;natural resources management

,Knowledge Management and Technical Support Services: Global,"<p>The <b>Knowledge Management and Technical Support Services</b> (KMTSS) project provided Knowledge Management support to the Land Tenure and Property Rights (LTPR) Division based on needs identified through a consultation process; and assisted in the development and implementation of a communication strategy. USAID’s LTPR Division had produced a significant amount of information over the past decade, which was continually being built upon and enhanced. From 2010-2011 alone, the LTPR Division more than doubled in size. Previous efforts to make information accessible had been challenging and costly. USAID staff, partners, and others engaged in international development activities require tools to more effectively share critical data and work together seamlessly. Implementation of a proper Knowledge Management (KM) programmatic approach improves performance, enhances competitive advantage, drives innovation, and enables sharing of lessons learned. KM allows integration and continuous improvement of the organizational operations. Additionally, While KM is important, it is not sufficient to meet the needs of broadcasting best lessons and methodologies to address land tenure challenges. Therefore, the development and implementation of a communication strategy was essential to complement KM programmatic approach.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>

,Kosovo Property Rights Program,"<p>The rule of law in Kosovo is constrained by poorly defined and enforced property rights, especially the property rights of women and members of minority communities. The absence of an effective property rights regime weakens democratic governance, impacts human rights, disempowers women and impedes sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>Working closely with the EU, the <strong>Kosovo Property Rights Program</strong> (PRP) will assist the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to develop a property reform strategy and new property law. PRP is the only donor-funded project in Kosovo working to improve court procedures related to property claims, with an emphasis on improving court practices that prevent women from inheriting property in practice. The project supports implementation of USAID Forward and Local Solutions by building the capacity of Kosovo Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and municipal governments to manage and administer USAID direct awards through grants and Government to Government (G2G) agreements. PRP supports local CSOs to develop and implement public information, awareness, and advocacy campaigns to inform women and men about women’s rights to property and change attitudes and behaviors that prevent women from inheriting property. The project also builds municipal capacity to improve delivery of property related services, enabling citizens to more efficiently engage in property related transactions.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the Property Rights Program (PRP) is to improve the property rights regime in Kosovo, strengthen the rule of law, and increase economic growth and investment. The Property Rights Program is implemented under four objectives:</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Objective 1: Better Coordination and Policy Priorities</li>
<li>Objective 2: Improved Court Procedures Related to Property Claims</li>
<li>Objective 3: Enhance Women’s Rights to Use Property in Practice</li>
<li>Objective 4: Improved Communication, Access to Information, and Understanding of Property Rights</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Development of implementation-oriented legislation to clearly define property rights and improve tenure security for women and members of minority communities</li>
<li>Development of improved court procedures to more efficiently resolve property claims and disputes</li>
<li>Increased capacity of courts to decide and enforce property rights</li>
<li>Increased capacity of Civil Society Organizations to raise public awareness, change societal attitudes and behaviors, and advocate for women’s rights to property</li>
<li>Increased number of women inheriting property and securing access to credit</li>
<li>Municipalities improve delivery of services to enable citizens to more easily transact their property rights</li>

,Land Access for Women: Vietnam,"<p>The implementation of radical reforms in the 1990s resulted in profound changes in legislation and public policy around land rights, contributing to Vietnam’s rapid economic growth. The 1993 Land Law created a land market and prompted a sweeping land redistribution program; within seven years, 11 million Land Use Rights Certificates (LURCS) were issued to rural households. Although this law was supposed to be gender neutral, more men benefited and received a larger portion of the LURCS. The 2003 Land Law corrected some of the gender inequalities by requiring LURCs to record the names of both spouses, as opposed to only the head of the household. However this supportive legal framework is thwarted by both men’s and women’s general lack of awareness of Vietnam’s property rights laws and lack of resources to enforce women’s property rights at the provincial level. Recent reports on the status of land rights in Vietnam suggest that the allocation and distribution of land is under the discretion of provincial authorities who may be influenced by customary practices which reinforce gender inequalities. As a result, violations of women’s land use rights persist.</p>
<p>To address these complexities, the <strong>Land Access for Women</strong> pilot program will combine commune-level legal rights counseling and education with advocacy efforts. Based in two provinces in Vietnam – Hung Yen in the North and Long An in the South – the program will strengthen the reach and efficacy of land rights for farmers, particularly women farmers. Research indicates that community-based paralegals are invaluable resources for poor and disadvantages persons to access legal systems to resolve property disputes.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the program is the mobilization and training of 60 volunteer paralegals from four communes across the two provinces. The paralegals will conduct land rights awareness-raising activities as well as provide legal counseling to individuals, mitigate land disputes and offer referrals to navigate the existing legal structures. Paralegals’ community education activities and delivery of local legal assistance will be complemented by advocacy conducted by civil society and mass organizations to promote more effective integration of gender into the content and implementation of current land law and any future reforms.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Increase farmers’ awareness of existing land rights under current legislation, especially women</li>
<li>Facilitate female farmers’ ability to access their land rights</li>
<li>Generate evidence about gender specific barriers to realizing land rights in rural areas</li>
<li>Increase the capacity of civil society organizations and mass organizations to advocate for gender equitable land reform</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 60 commune-based paralegals identified, trained and commissioned to raise awareness and provide legal aid for land related rights for farmers, particularly women. Of the total number, at least 50% of paralegals will be women</li>
<li>Increased awareness of land rights and protection mechanisms under the current law among farmers in the project area, particularly women, as evidenced by an increase in the use of legal mechanisms for the protection of land related rights by women</li>
<li>Increased recognition of women’s land related rights within the communes and provinces, as evidenced by an increase in the issuance of land use certificates jointly to spouses, and to individual women</li>
<li>Increase in the gender responsiveness of land administration and management structures and procedures. A proxy measure of this outcome is set at the activity level: number of officials trained on women’s land rights</li>
<li>Increased knowledge of the challenges to secure land rights among women farmers in the intervention area and how to mitigate those challenges</li>
<li>Increased capacity of civil society organizations to demand gender responsive land laws, policies and practice</li>
<li>Formulation and delivery of recommendations for concrete strategies in integrating gender into the implementation of the new law at the national level</li>

<p>After four years of intense negotiations in Havana, Cuba, between the GOC and the FARC, both parties signed a peace accord in the final months of 2016 with the intent of ending more than 50 years of civil war. Although several controversies swirled around the final terms of the agreement, they did not center on the agreement’s commitments to strengthen land tenure security and rural livelihoods, giving the program significant latitude to continue collaborating with the GOC to facilitate land restitution, strengthen smallholder land rights, and mobilize the provision of public goods and services in historically neglected rural areas—and thereby create the conditions for sustaining peace.</p>

,Land Policy and Institutional Support: Liberia,"<h2>Land Policy and Institutional Support in Liberia</h2>
<p>The Land Policy and Institutional Support (LPIS) Project, supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), is collaborating with the Liberian Land Commission, the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME) and the Center for National Document and Records Agency (CNDRA) to improve the policy and legal frameworks for land management and thereby increase security of tenure, investment in land, and land market activity.</p>
<p>LPIS provided recommendations for addressing sources of tenure insecurity faced by rural communities in Liberia based on land and natural resource tenure field research. The Land Commission has already incorporated these recommendations in drafting a land rights policy that recognizes customary tenure and stipulates that the tenure category has the same rights as private tenure and should be protected accordingly. The draft policy paper is a result of lengthy deliberations of a Real Property Task Force, one of many task forces within the Land Commission. USAID and MCC are supporting other task forces, land conflict resolution, land use and management, and land administration, through technical assistance.</p>
<p>LPIS collaborated with the Department of Lands, Surveys and Cartography within MLME, as well as the Survey Licensing and Registration Board and the Cartographic and Surveyors Association of Liberia, to improve the survey infrastructure through the acquisition and subsequent training in the use of modern survey equipment, as well as reviews of existing spatial data, and development of geodetic control standards.</p>
<p>LPIS conducted a thorough baseline study of existing processes within CNDRA, followed by developing numerous recommendations for modernizing the institution. CNDRA has undergone ambitious reform over the last year, highlighted by the opening of the Customer Service Center. LPIS supported the physical reconstruction of the center as well as the provision of hardware and software to digitize and register land deeds. The center allows CNDRA staff to quickly scan land deeds and accompanying maps and return the original documents to the landowners. In the two months following the opening of the Customer Service Center, over 400 transactions took place, of which 76 were deeds, and 10 enquiries.</p>
<p>The <b>Land Policy and Institutional Support (LPIS)</b> project seeks to 1) increase clarity and public understanding of property rights issues in order to inform reforms of land policies and laws; 2) rebuild management and public and private surveying capacity to improve future land administration, and 3) increase efficiency in deed registration, restore and improve deed records and procedures.</p>

,Land-Potential Knowledge System,"<p>Achieving long-term food security while protecting biodiversity and other ecosystem services will require: sustainable intensification of production on existing lands, restoration of degraded lands, and converting to agriculture only those lands where potential production is high, while degradation risk is low. To meet these requirements, knowledge and information about how land potential varies at field to regional scales is needed. However, existing knowledge and information about land potential is poorly integrated and unavailable at the scale of small farms where it is most urgently needed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Land-Potential Knowledge System</strong> (LandPKS) aims to increase access to global and local land potential knowledge. The program is developing innovative mobile data collection, analysis methods, and tools to be used by farmers, pastoralists, governments, and development workers to sustainably increase agricultural production, biodiversity conservation, and improve climate change adaptation efforts and other ecosystem services.</p>
<p>LandPKS uses mobile phone and cloud computing technologies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Globalize access to local and scientific knowledge and information about land potential,</li>
<li>Identify and deliver the knowledge and information relevant to each type of land/soil to anyone with a mobile phone, and</li>
<li>Connect people with similar types of lands and challenges with each other to share learning and experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through an interagency agreement issued from USAID, USDA’s Agricultural Research Service is developing LandPKS as a platform to allow others to use as the foundation for developing apps to address more specific information needs. The suite of mobile phone applications is currently being tested as a pilot in Kenya and Namibia, and the first application will be released to the global public in April or May 2015.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support long-term, sustainable increases in productivity and biodiversity conservation through improved land-use planning and better land management</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Local and scientific knowledge about the potential productivity, biodiversity, and resilience of specific types of land for local, regional, and global application will be collected, shared, and integrated</li>
<li>Governments, farmers, and pastoralists will have greater access to local and scientific knowledge from all over the world that is relevant to specific types of land<br>
Innovation will be promoted through peer-to-peer learning</li>
<li>Gender equality will be increased by providing women farmers improved access to knowledge and information</li>

,Mobile Application to Secure Tenure: Tanzania,"<p>Under the <a href=""/project/evaluation-research-and-communication-global/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Evaluation, Research and Communication</a> (ERC) project, USAID is piloting a project to crowd-source land rights information at the village level in Tanzania using mobile technology. The <strong>Mobile Application to Secure Tenure</strong> (MAST) project (formerly the Mobile Technology Pilot) supports identified needs of the Government of Tanzania to improve land governance and lower the cost of land certification programs. The pilot tests a new, participatory approach for capturing land rights information, as well as a lower cost methodology for quickly building a reliable database of land rights claims. MAST may be particularly helpful to the Government of Tanzania as an alternative to more traditional, and more costly, land administration interventions.</p>
<p>Formal land administration systems (LAS) in developing countries have generally not met the need for accessible, cost effective, and appropriately nuanced land registration. As a result, large majorities of rural dwellers (and many urban dwellers) live without formalized rights to land and other valuable resources. This lack of documentation may constrain the ability of individuals and communities to leverage their land-based assets for improved economic outcomes, to limit environmental harms, and to engage in collaborative contracting with prospective investors in land that leads to equitable sharing of benefits. Given rising concerns related to inappropriate and potentially harmful transfers of land rights from vulnerable populations to domestic and foreign investors, many tenure experts view the need to document existing rights in a participatory and efficient way as a high priority.</p>
<p>Through the Mobile Application to Secure Tenure project, USAID will test the hypothesis that under certain conditions mobile technologies that support crowd-sourced information about a variety of land rights/tenure claims can be linked to databases that government can use to issue formal documentation in a more cost effective and time sensitive manner or serve as an independent registry of claims, thus, increasing land tenure security. The pilot approach combines relatively inexpensive and readily available mobile technologies (e.g., GPS/GNSS-enabled smart phones and tablets) coupled with broadly participatory crowd-sourced data collection methods in rural and underserved settings. The approach will train civil society representatives and/or local community members to use technology developed for this purpose to gather land rights and tenure information.</p>

,Mobile Applications to Secure Tenure: Burkina Faso,"<p>Under the <a href=""/project/evaluation-research-and-communication-global/"">Evaluation, Research and Communications (ERC)</a> project, USAID launched the <strong>Mobile Applications to Secure Tenure (MAST)</strong> Pilot in Burkina Faso. MAST uses a simple android app and a semi-crowdsourced methodology to facilitate the mapping and documentation of land in a more efficient, transparent, and affordable manner. USAID has already successfully piloted <a href=""/project/mobile-application-to-secure-tenure-tanzania/"">MAST in Tanzania</a>, where it is now being scaled across an entire district. In Burkina, USAID is working with the <a href=""/project/national-land-observatory-pilot-burkina-faso/"">Observatoire National du Foncier</a> (which is funded by USAID) and with the Government of Burkina Faso to pilot MAST in four villages within Boudry Commune, close to Ouagadougou.</p>
<p>In 2009 the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF) adopted Law 034-2009 along with related decrees and codes to provide a mechanism to secure customary land rights in rural and peri-urban areas and to deliver land certificates (APFR). To implement the law, however, the GoBF currently relies on ad hoc efforts that are developed and implemented by donor and NGO-led projects to secure land rights across 302 rural communes. This lack of standard approach makes it more difficult to share land information across government agencies and offices, to promote land transparency, and to create a body of knowledge from which research can be generated.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, MAST was used to successfully document and record land rights, resulting in the distribution of 3,800 Certificates of Customary Rights to Occupancy (CCROs) to 1,312 households. By piloting MAST in Burkina Faso, USAID seeks to provide a relatively simple and user-friendly technology and implementation methodology that can be used to build awareness of, and respect for, land rights in rural Burkina Faso (including women’s land rights); enhance the capacity of Land Tenure Services (SFR) agents and local governance representatives to map and record land rights information; reduce time and costs associated with delivery of land rights documentation; and improve the exchange of land information among various agencies and stakeholders in Burkina Faso. The overarching objective of the project is to adapt the existing technology to a new context in order to secure rural land rights and improve land governance in Burkina Faso.</p>",,2016,2017,USD 238000,https://www.land-links.org/project/mobile-applications-secure-tenure-burkina-faso/,BFA,USAID,,,

,Property Rights and Artisanal Diamond Development II: Central African Republic,"<p>The <strong>Property Rights and Artisanal Diamond Development II (PRADD II) Project</strong> supports the government of the Central African Republic (CAR) to implement mining best practices and promotes good governance of the mining sector at the international level through the Kimberley Process (KP), the international mechanism that strives to prevent rough diamonds from fueling conflict. The objective of PRADD II is to increase the number of alluvial diamonds entering the formal chain of custody, while improving the benefits accruing to diamond mining communities. PRADD II also promotes peace building through supporting the reestablishment of the legitimate conflict-free diamond supply chain in Kimberley Process-approved “compliant zones”. The anticipated result and aim is that rough diamond exports from these compliant zones will resume, thereby providing a legal export channel, reducing the role of illegal diamonds in fueling conflict, and contributing to economic reconstruction. In addition, it is hoped that social cohesion in diamond mining communities and adhesion of all diamond sector actors to the legitimate supply chain will be strengthened, contributing to long-term peace-building.</p>
<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
<h3>BUILDING GOVERNMENT CAPACITY</h3>
<p>PRADD II assisted the government with developing an operational framework for implementing the KP requirements. PRADD II is working closely with the CAR authorities to establish processes to address the Operational Framework in CAR’s five compliant zones. PRADD II coordinated the consolidation and input of diamond data for the period from 2006 to 2013 and handed the database over to the General Director of the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Hydrology and the KP Permanent Secretariat to help fulfill a key requirement of the Operational Framework conditions imposed by the (KP). In addition, PRADD II worked closely with the mining authorities to prepare reforms in the collection of diamond production and marketing data required of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) and procured e-tablets and GPS units for data collections and geo-referencing of artisanal diamond mining sites. These reforms have now been codified within the ministry and are the basis of decision making matrices spelling out for the first time how and when data should be collected. PRADD II has contributed to the establishment of the national and local Monitoring Committees required by the KP, but at the national level this structure remains weak due to governance challenges in CAR.</p>
<h3>ADVANCING SOCIAL COHESION</h3>
<p>A one-month long field diagnostic on the evolution of the artisanal diamond mining economy and its contributions to social cohesion was completed in mid-2016, and principle findings were presented at a workshop convened by the Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Hydrology. The influential study spells out ways to use traditional African conflict resolution approaches to help resolve outstanding disputes between ethnic and religious groups in diamond mining communities. Following this study, PRADD II is working with international non-governmental organizations specializing in conflict management to bring their focus and work to these diamond mining communities.</p>
<h3>STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY</h3>
<p>PRADD II partnered with an international research center to hold a workshop with 25 civil society organizations on the dynamics of the artisanal diamond economy within the broader mining sector. For the first time ever, civil society was actively solicited by the Ministry of Mines to learn more about the complex diamond economy and to play a constructive, informed, and active role in advocating transparency in the diamond mining sector.</p>",,2013,2018,USD 18900000,https://www.land-links.org/project/property-rights-artisanal-diamond-development-ii-central-african-republic/,CAF,USAID,,,

,Tenure and Global Climate Change: Burma,"<p>Using policy engagement, pilot interventions, in-depth case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analysis, the USAID <strong>Tenure and Global Climate Change project</strong> is advancing knowledge and practice on how land tenure and resource rights relate to global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Burma is experiencing rapid economic transformation across multiple sectors in urban, peri-urban and rural areas. This transition is creating risks for the environment and economic opportunities for Burma’s diverse population, and placing new importance on responsible governance of land and natural resources, as secure land tenure is a cornerstone for peace and stability. As policies and legislation are developed to better govern these resources, existing communal and customary rights must be incorporated. At the same time, new policies must be piloted in various communities to demonstrate broad applicability before national activities are launched.</p>
<p>Land-based natural resources in the country, including farmland and forests that are needed for urban expansion or infrastructure projects, will be essential components of a more equitable approach to national economic development. Decisions on how land will be used, by whom, and for what purposes could have far reaching consequences for the people of Burma, the majority of whom are currently smallholder farmers living in the countryside.</p>
<p>USAID works in close collaboration with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC), multiple civil society organizations and other groups, both public and private, to ensure the successful implementation of this project.</p>
<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>USAID’s Land Tenure Project has a number of inter-related objectives focused on contributing to the goals of broad-based economic development, improving livelihoods in rural areas, promoting sustainable land use management and achieving resilient community development. Specific goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting the development and implementation of a National Land Use Policy and related laws that clarify rights and encourage sustainable use of land and natural resources;</li>
<li>Strengthening the land tenure, resource, and property rights of rural individuals, households and communities, with particular attention to women, ethnic minorities, smallholder farmers and other vulnerable groups; and,</li>
<li>Increasing consultation among government, civil society and business on issues of broad public concern related to land tenure and land use.</li>

,Tenure and Global Climate Change: Zambia,"<p>Using policy engagement, pilot interventions, in-depth case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analysis, the USAID <strong>Tenure and Global Climate Change project</strong> is advancing knowledge and practice on how land tenure and resource rights relate to global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The majority of land in Zambia is allocated and administered by traditional authorities, led by a chief and based on the application of customary practices. As Zambia’s economy and population grow, new pressures are placed on customary lands and its forest and wildlife resources. Demographic and social pressures bring increased land disputes and pressure to convert customary land to state administered leasehold land. Individual smallholders commonly have no documentation of their land claims, resulting in complex land disputes over boundaries, defense of rights in the event of divorce, death of a family member, or reallocation of land. Such boundary disputes are reportedly becoming more common. Both traditional leaders and village members are increasingly attuned to a need for some form of documentation to assist in long-term land management. Additionally, Zambian law places forest and wildlife resources under state control, and with limited mechanisms for devolving rights and benefits to local stakeholders.</p>
<p>As the Government of Zambia develops a new land policy, and launches a land audit, national land titling program, and new forest and wildlife acts, it is important to demonstrate cost-effective models for customary land documentation, administration and management that promote and strengthen the role of local institutions and result in sustainable land and resource management. Since 2014, USAID’s Tenure and Global Climate Change (TGCC) project has supported the Chipata District Land Alliance (CDLA) to pilot tenure strengthening activities in over 130 villages in four chiefdoms in the Chipata District. USAID’s work focuses on the role of traditional leaders as custodians of customary land. As part of this work, USAID is undertaking a randomized-control trial impact evaluation to better understand whether customary land documentation increases sustainable land use practices, like agroforestry.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The local level USAID-supported interventions include activities related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chiefdom-level mapping of resources, particularly communal resources, as well as documenting customary rules around land administration and management;</li>
<li>Village-level mapping and resolution of village boundary disputes, and supporting headpersons in local land administration through village committees; and</li>
<li>Supporting Chiefs to deliver and administer customary land certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early results from Chipata, with over 6,000 customary land certificates distributed, demonstrate a keen interest in documenting village and household lands as well as shared resources. In order to assess the scalability of this approach, TGCC is supporting the Petauke District Land Alliance to carry out a similar process in Sandwe Chiefdom on 180,000 hectares at the southern-most border of Zambia’s wildlife flagship, South Luangwa National Park.</p>
<p>USAID’s support is bringing international good practices on systematic land documentation to Zambia through collaboration with government, civil society organizations, and other cooperating partners. This has involved communication at the national level of lessons learned and training to a range of actors.</p>
<p>In addition to assistance on land documentation, USAID’s TGCC program is providing support for government, civil society, and traditional authorities to discuss the range of policy and legal issues around customary and state land administration, and feed these discussions into national policy and legislative processes. This involves supporting consultation between government and the chiefs, as well as promoting public comment on land legislation. USAID is promoting a Zambian-driven research agenda on land administration and management through research seed funds and an annual research symposium.</p>
<p>TGCC’s work in Zambia bridges policy, pilot implementation, multi-stakeholder consultations and empirical research to promote land policy and rural land administration that achieves sustainable livelihoods, climate change mitigation and increased communication between government, rural leaders and local communities.</p>",,2013,2018,USD 13400000,https://www.land-links.org/project/tenure-global-climate-change-zambia/,ZMB,USAID,,,
,Tenure and Global Climate Change: Global,"<p>Globally, the impacts of climate change and society’s response are significantly affecting resource tenure governance, the rights of communities and people, and their livelihoods. In turn, resource tenure and property rights issues are widely recognized as crucial in the success of many climate change-related initiatives. Interventions that strengthen resource tenure and property rights governance can help reduce vulnerability; increase the resilience of people and ecosystems in the face of climate impacts; and promote resource use practices that achieve adaptation, mitigation, and development objectives.</p>
<p>Using policy engagement, pilot interventions, in-depth case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analysis, the USAID <strong>Tenure and Global Climate Change project</strong> is advancing knowledge and practice on how land tenure and resource rights relate to global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Through work in over ten countries, common themes have emerged related to: using <strong>mobile applications to secure tenure (MAST)</strong>; supporting the <strong>recognition and documentation of customary rights</strong>; using <strong>pilot activities to inform national policy</strong> discussions in an iterative fashion; and supporting the clarification of government and local resource rights and responsibilities in areas where there are overlapping or ambiguous laws and customs, such as <strong>coastal and marine zones, wildlife management areas and forested areas</strong>.</p>
<p>USAID is supporting communities and households in the Eastern Province of <strong>Zambia</strong> to document their customary rights to agricultural land and communal resources, as well as supporting climate-smart agriculture (CSA) extension activities. Project work in Zambia is being evaluated through a randomized-control impact evaluation to better understand how tenure activities influence CSA adoption. CSA practices rely on sustained commitment to land stewardship. Yet, for farmers to be willing to invest time and energy into these long-term land management practices, they need tenure security. Additional work across a rural chiefdom is exploring the impacts of tenure security on reducing deforestation and improving wildlife management. The project activities are engaging with civil society, government, and donors to promote the integration of lessons learned from customary land rights documentation into national processes.</p>
<p>TGCC is also helping ensure the clarification and respect for rights related to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and incentivizing afforestation/reforestation (REDD+). Guidance and national legal analyses in <strong>Guatemala, Honduras, Nepal</strong>, and <strong>Panama</strong> are helping governments, the private sector, and intergovernmental partners clarify who has rights to participate in, and benefit from, forest carbon activities, and how to design successful activities that account for tenure.</p>
<p>In <strong>Burma</strong>, the project is contributing to the development of a National Land Use Policy (NLUP) and its subsequent implementation. TGCC’s support has been central to the ground-breaking multi-stakeholder consultative process that led to adoption of the NLUP, even at a time of historic government transition. To advance lessons for policy implementation, TGCC developed models for documenting and protecting customary and communal rights, and approaches that build constructive relationships between local communities and local government on land management. In particular, the project is addressing the importance of women’s tenure rights, including rights to access, use, and manage forest resources.</p>
<p>TGCC is collaborating with private sector actors to support social and environmental goals under <strong>Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 commitments.</strong> This emerging work with cocoa companies in <strong>Ghana</strong>, and the beef sector in <strong>Paraguay</strong> is exploring the deforestation risks related to smallholder and community tenure insecurity in commodity supply chains. In 2017 TGCC will focus on actions that companies can take to mitigate the risks of insecure tenure and deforestation in their supply chains.</p>
<p>Finally, building on lessons from USAID’s deep history in land tenure and property rights, TGCC project staff are supporting USAID missions to assess <strong>marine resource tenure systems</strong> and develop interventions that lead to achievement of biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation, and resource productivity objectives. The governance of marine resources affects the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people globally. The application of secure tenure and property rights to coastal and marine systems has the potential to strengthen programming and build the resilience of the people and institutions who rely on these resources. Within this coastal ecosystem, <strong>mangrove forests</strong> hold immense carbon stocks and face unique threats as they often have ambiguous and overlapping governance regimes among communities, government agencies and private sector actors. TGCC is supporting resource tenure analyses of mangrove systems alongside the development of pilot intervention activities in <strong>Vietnam</strong>.</p>
