  <title>Do development projects crowd out private-sector activities? A survival analysis of contract farming participation in northern Ghana</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Contract farming (CF) is attractive as a possible private-sector-led strategy for improving smallholder farmers’ welfare. Yet many CF schemes suffer from high turnover of participating farmers and struggle to survive. So far, the dynamics of CF participation have remained largely unexplored. We employ duration analysis to examine factors affecting entry into and exit from different maize CF schemes in northern Ghana, focusing specifically on the impact of development projects on CF entry and exit. We find that agricultural development projects reduce the likelihood of scheme entry and increase the likelihood of exit. Our findings confirm concerns that, if interventions are not planned in accordance with relevant private-sector actors, private-sector initiatives can be hindered by competing development projects.</descri>

  <title>Does a “Blue Revolution” help the poor? Evidence from Bangladesh</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The impressive growth in aquaculture is now commonly dubbed a “blue revolution.” In some Asian countries, fish availability has increased at a faster rate in recent decades than did cereal availability during the Green Revolution. As an example, Bangladesh is one country where aquaculture has increased almost eightfold since the early 1990s. This growth has important implications for food and nutrition securities. Yet, there is little research on the determinants and impacts of this growth to document the lessons, identify evolving issues, and guide policy discussions. This paper attempts to fill that gap. Using several rounds of nationally representative household survey data, the authors conducted microsimulations to generate disaggregated estimates. The results show that, between 2000 and 2010, about 12 percent of Bangladesh’s overall poverty reduction can be attributed to aquaculture growth. In other words, of the 18 million Bangladeshis who escaped poverty during this period, more than 2 million of them managed to do so because of the growth in aquaculture. However, the results vary widely across income groups, with households in the third income quintile (which is not the poorest) benefiting the most. The implications of the results, methodological issues, and areas of future research are also discussed.</descri>

  <title>2016 Global Food Policy Report</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The Global Food Policy Report is IFPRI’s flagship publication. This year’s annual report examines major food policy issues, global and regional developments, and commitments made in 2015, and presents data on key food policy indicators. The report also proposes key policy options for 2016 and beyond to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2015, the global community made major commitments on sustainable development and climate change. The global food system lies at the heart of these commitments—and we will only be able to meet the new goals if we work to transform our food system to be more inclusive, climate-smart, sustainable, efficient, nutrition- and health-driven, and business-friendly.</descri>

  <title>2016 Global Food Policy Report: Synopsis [in Russian]</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Для международного сообщества 2015 год стал поворотным моментом. Окончание срока выполнения Целей развития тысячелетия подчеркнуло поразительные успехи, достигнутые с 1990 года: доля людей, живущих в крайней нищете, уровень детской смертности и масштабы голода сократились почти вдвое. Однако по-прежнему остаются огромные проблемы. В Отчете о глобальной продовольственной политике 2016 рассматриваются основные тенденции, события и изменения, которые повлияли на продовольственную безопасность и полноценное питание в 2015 году и продолжат это делать в будущем, а также исследуется, как глобальная продовольственная система может способствовать дальнейшему сокращению масштабов голода, неполноценного питания и нищеты, обеспечивая при этом устойчивое использование мировых ресурсов. 2016 год станет критическим для перехода от принятия новых обязательств на глобальном и национальном уровнях к действию.</descri>

  <title>Contracting by small farmers in commodities with export potential: Assessing farm profits of lentil growers in Nepal</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study is undertaken to quantify the benefits of contract farming (CF) on farmers’ income in a case where new market opportunities are emerging for smallholder farmers in Nepal. CF is emerging as an important form of vertical coordination in the agrifood supply chain. The prospect for CF in a country like Nepal with accessibility issues, underdeveloped markets, and a lack of amenities remains ambiguous. Contractors find it difficult to build links in these cases, particularly when final consumers have quality and safety requirements. However, a lack of other market opportunities makes the contracts more sustainable. The latter happens if there are product-specific quality advantages because of agroecology and, more important, lack of side-selling opportunities. Concerns remain about monoposonistic powers of the buyers when small farmers do not have outside options. Results of this study show that CF is significantly more profitable (81 percent greater net income) than independent production, the main pathway being higher yield and price realization. The positive impact of CF on farmers’ profits can help Nepal in harnessing the growing demand for pulses, especially in neighboring international markets, like India.</descri>

  <title>An agriculture- and trade-focused social accounting matrix for Tunisia, 2012</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The purpose of this paper is to document the different steps followed to construct the Tunisian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the year 2012. More precisely, it describes the estimation methods and the nature of data used in the development of the SAM, which has a specific focus on the agriculture and food sectors. The SAM also features a regional disaggregation by three agro-ecological zones. The data used in the construction process are based on two main publications of the “Institut National de la Statistique” (INS): the input-output table (I/O) (2012) and the supply-use table (2012). The I/O (2012) disaggregates the Tunisian economy into 24 sectors, including two agri-food sectors: (1) Agriculture and Fishery, and (2) Food Industries. The supply-use table accounts for about 400 commodities, of which 59 are agriculture, forestry, and fishery products and 64 are processed-food products. Other major information sources used include the household survey publication (2010), the annual report of the Central Bank (2013), the “Annuaire des Statistiques Agricoles” (Ministry of Agriculture 2013c), and the “Budget Economique” (2013). </descri>

  <title>An Analysis of the Fishing Industry in Namibia: The Structure, Performance, Challenges, and Prospects for Growth and Diversification</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This paper analyses the structure of Namibia’s fishery sector, which consists of both marine-based fisheries and aquaculture. The study examines the sectors’ governance structure and the evolution of fishery stocks and assesses the performance of the sector in terms of catch effort, sectoral contribution to GDP, employment, and contribution to international trade. The analysis concentrates on the marine-based fisheries and applies two analytical methods: a qualitative approach that solicits views from local fishing associations and companies and a quantitative approach that uses the decision support model to identify realistic export opportunities. The main challenges inhibiting the growth of Namibia’s fishery sector include a shortage of skilled labor, a lack of vessels, seismic impacts of oil exploration, and threats posed by proposed phosphate mining at sea. The paper also examines the government’s drive for value addition, arguing that what is deemed value addition from one angle may constitute value destruction from another. The authors also argue that the drive for value addition may cause companies to face problems with their current trading partners, who may use sanitary and phytosanitary measures to restrict the entry of processed fish into their markets.</descri>

  <title>Can contract farming increase farmers’ income and enhance adoption of food safety practices?: Evidence from remote areas of Nepal</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Growing inequality has become an important concern in many countries. One of the ways that inequality is perpetuated is through differential market access across regions. This research deals with one of the primary determinants of regional inequality manifested in terms of market access. Nepal is one country where hierarchical geography leads to regional inequality. Differential market access can cause as well as accentuate inequality among farmers. Coordination arrangements such as contract farming can improve outcomes for the farmers and integrators on the one hand, but on the other hand it can accentuate inequality if only some regions benefit from it. With this background, in this paper we study the case of contract farming for exports with farmers in remote hilly areas of Nepal. The prospect for contract farming in such areas with accessibility issues owing to underdeveloped markets and lack of amenities is ambiguous. On the one hand, contractors in these areas find it difficult to build links, particularly when final consumers have quality and safety requirements. On the other hand, remoteness can make the contracts more sustainable if the agroecology offers product-specific quality advantages and, more important, if there is a lack of side-selling opportunities. At the same time, concerns remain about buyers’ monopsonistic powers when remotely located small farmers do not have outside options. This study hence quantifies the benefits of contract farming on remotely located farmers’ income and compliance with food safety measures. Results show that contract farming is significantly more profitable (offering a 58 percent greater net income) than independent production, the main pathway being higher price realization, along with training on practices and provision of quality seeds.</descri>

  <title>Synopsis: Agricultural growth in Ethiopia (2004-2014): Evidence and drivers</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Ethiopia’s agricultural sector has recorded remarkable rapid growth in the last decade. This note documents aspects of this growth process. Over the last decade, there have been significant increases – more than a doubling – in the use of modern inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and improved seeds, explaining part of that growth. However, there was also significant land expansion, increased labor use, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth estimated at 2.3 percent per year. The expansion in modern input use appears to have been driven by high government expenditures on the agricultural sector, including agricultural extension, but also by an improved road network, higher rural education levels, and favorable international and local price incentives.</descri>

  <title>A user guide to Mali Africa research in sustainable intensification for the next generation (Africa RISING) baseline evaluation survey data</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The Mali Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING) Baseline Evaluation Survey (MARBES) survey was implemented during May-July 2014 as part of IFPRI’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of Africa RISING. The Africa RISING program aims to create-through action research and development partnerships-opportunities for smallholder farmers in Africa south of the Sahara  to sustainably intensify their farming systems and to improve their food, nutrition, and income security. Initiated in 2012, the program is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of the U.S. government’s Feed the Future (FTF) initiative. As part of the program, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) leads a sustainable intensification effort focusing on the cereal-based farming systems in the Guinea Savannah Zone of West Africa (Ghana and Mali) and East and Southern Africa (Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia) while the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) leads the research activities focusing on the crop-livestock systems of the Ethiopian highlands. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has been tasked with M&E of the three projects. Mali Africa RISING is being implemented in Bougouni, Yanfolila and Koutiala cercles (the cercle is a type of administrative region), in the Sikasso region of Mali, within the FTF Zones of Influence.  The research activities are led by IITA, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), ILRI, the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC), and the International Center for Research in Agroforestry or World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF), as well as local partners: L’Association Malienne d’Eveil et de Développement Durable (AMEDD), l'Association Malienne pour la Sécurité et la Souveraineté Alimentaires  (AMASSA), and Mouvement Biologique du Mali  (MOBIOM). MARBES collected detailed household- and plot-crop level data addressing various topics: employment (agricultural and non-agricultural); health; agricultural land; crop inputs, harvest, storage, and sale; livestock ownership, feed, and water; agriculture-related challenges and coping strategies; credit and off-farm income sources; housing conditions and ownership of various durable assets; subjective welfare and food security; household-level food consumption; non-food expenditure; agricultural shocks; and child and women anthropometry. The community survey collected data on access to basic services; access to extension services; social organizations, mobility, and village-level shocks; access to natural resources; metric conversion units; and prices of crops and food items. MARBES covered 705 households and 20 communities drawn from the three project cercles. Data was collected using structured questionnaires in multiple local languages through Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing, using the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro).</descri>

  <title>Rapport 2016 sur les politiques alimentaires mondiales: Synopsis</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>L’année 2015 a marqué un tournant décisif pour la communauté internationale du développement. L’aboutissement des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement a souligné les avancées remarquables enregistrées depuis 1990 : l’extrême pauvreté, la mortalité infantile et la faim ont toutes chuté à peu près de moitié. Toutefois, un défi considérable demeure. Le Rapport 2016 sur les politiques alimentaires mondiales passe en revue les tendances, événements et changements principaux influant sur la sécurité alimentaire et la nutrition en 2015 et au-delà, en plus d’explorer la façon dont le système alimentaire mondial peut contribuer au mieux à la poursuite de la lutte contre la faim, la malnutrition et la pauvreté, tout en garantissant l’utilisation durable des ressources de la planète. L’année 2016 sera déterminante pour passer des nouveaux engagements nationaux et internationaux à l’action.</descri>

  <title>A user guide to Tanzania Africa research in sustainable intensification for the next generation (Africa RISING) baseline evaluation survey data</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The Tanzania Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING) Baseline Evaluation Survey (TARBES) was implemented during February-April 2014 as part of the International Food Policy Research Institute’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of Africa RISING.  The Africa RISING program aims to create—through action research and development partnerships—opportunities for smallholder farmers in Africa south of the Sahara to sustainably intensify their farming systems and to improve their food, nutrition, and income security. Initiated in 2012, the program is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of the U.S. government’s Feed the Future (FTF) initiative. As part of the program, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) leads a sustainable intensification effort focusing on the cereal-based farming systems in the Guinea Savannah Zone of West Africa (Ghana and Mali) and East and Southern Africa (Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia) while the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) leads the research activities focusing on the crop-livestock systems of the Ethiopian highlands. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has been tasked with M&E of the three projects. Tanzania Africa RISING is being implemented in Babati, Kongwa, and Kiteto districts in Tanzania.  The research activities are led by IITA. TARBES collected detailed household- and plot-crop level data addressing various topics: employment (agricultural and non-agricultural); health; agricultural land; crop inputs, harvest, storage, and sale; livestock ownership, feed, and water; agriculture-related challenges and coping strategies; credit and off-farm income sources; housing conditions and ownership of various durable assets; subjective welfare and food security; household-level food consumption; non-food expenditure; agricultural shocks; and child and women anthropometry. The community survey collected data on access to basic services; access to extension services; social organizations, mobility, and village-level shocks; access to natural resources; metric conversion units; and prices of crops and food items. TARBES covered 810 households and 25 communities drawn from the three project districts.  Data was collected using structured questionnaires in multiple local languages through Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (using Surveybe). </descri>

  <title>“As a husband I will love, lead, and provide:” Gendered access to land in Ghana</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Improving women’s access to land is high on the agricultural policy agenda of both governmental and non-governmental agencies. Yet, the determinants and rationale of gendered access to land are not well understood. This paper argues that gender relations are more than the outcomes of negotiations within households. It explains the importance of social norms, perceptions, and formal and informal rules shaping access to land for male and female farmers at four levels: (1) the household/family, (2) the community, (3) the state, and (4) the market. The framework is applied to Ghana. Norms on household and family organization and on men’s and women’s responsibilities and capabilities play a key role in gendered allocation of resources. However, these norms and perceptions are dynamic and evolve jointly with the development of markets and changes in values of inputs such as labor and land. Theoretical models that represent the gendered distribution of assets as the result of intrahousehold bargaining should be revised, and extrahousehold factors should be included. From a policy perspective, laws that ensure gender equality in terms of inheritance and a more gender-equitable distribution of property upon divorce can play a key role in improving women’s property rights. Yet, their impact may be limited where customary rights dominate and social norms and rules continue to discriminate according to gender.</descri>

  <descri>The Global Food Policy Report is IFPRI’s flagship publication. This year’s annual report examines major food policy issues, global and regional developments, and commitments made in 2015, and presents data on key food policy indicators. The report also proposes key policy options for 2016 and beyond to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2015, the global community made major commitments on sustainable development and climate change. The global food system lies at the heart of these commitments—and we will only be able to meet the new goals if we work to transform our food system to be more inclusive, climate-smart, sustainable, efficient, nutrition- and health-driven, and business-friendly.</descri>

  <title>Understanding compliance in programs promoting conservation agriculture: Modeling a case study in Malawi</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Land degradation and soil erosion have emerged as serious challenges to smallholder farmers throughout southern Africa. To combat these challenges, conservation agriculture (CA) is widely promoted as a sustainable package of agricultural practices. Despite the many potential benefits of CA, however, adoption remains low. Yet relatively little is known about the decision-making process in choosing to adopt CA. This article attempts to fill this important knowledge gap by studying CA adoption in southern Malawi. Unlike what is implicitly assumed when these packages of practices are introduced, farmers view adoption as a series of independent decisions rather than a single decision. Yet the adoption decisions are not wholly independent. We find strong evidence of interrelated decisions, particularly among mulching crop residues and practicing zero tillage, suggesting that mulching residues and intercropping or rotating with legumes introduces a multiplier effect on the adoption of zero tillage.</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The purpose of this report is to provide national- and state-level policymakers, private-sector investors, civil society, and donors with an analysis of the rural economy of Mon State and pathways to improved prosperity for its population. The analysis is based on a representative survey of rural households, which make up 73 percent of Mon State’s 2 million residents, and extensive interviews with farmers, traders, processors, local leaders, and government officials. Whereas some parts of the Mon State economy are quite dynamic, such as construction, others are stagnant and far from reaching their full potential. Furthermore, the dynamic sectors are heavily dependent on remittances from migrants to neighboring countries. The current pattern of donor investment is heavily focused on necessary infrastructure and energy investments, but with only very limited support to productive sectors, especially agriculture and fisheries. Major investments in education, both formal and vocational training, are also necessary to support the growth of a modern economy. The analysis in this report identifies options for more balanced growth, leading to a vibrant economy in which returning migrants can invest and find employment.</descri>

  <title>Rural livelihoods in Mon State: Evidence from a representative household survey</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The purpose of this report is to provide information and analysis to government, civil society, and donors interested in improving the well-being of the rural population of Mon State. Specifically, the report analyzes the different sources of income for rural households, as well as their socioeconomic characteristics, with a view to identifying potential pathways to improving incomes, especially for poor households, and stimulating inclusive rural growth. The overall picture that emerges is one of an economy heavily dependent on services for local employment and on international migration for income. Like a two-legged stool, such an economy is potentially unstable in the face of external shocks. Diversification of the Mon State economy, including diversification and increased productivity within the agricultural sector, will lessen the relative dependence on external migration remittances and result in more resilient growth in the future</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Private sector agricultural extension has expanded rapidly in many developing countries in the wake of drastic funding cuts made to public extension systems in the 1980s and 1990s. Motivated by the increase in sales or contract farming revenues that extension can generate, private providers include seed and input companies, distributors and dealers, service providers, food processors and retailers, and mobile phone companies. Mixed public-private systems are now becoming common. How well can the private sector fill the gap left by dysfunctional public systems? Knowledge Driven Development: Private Extension and Global Lessons provides a critical assessment of the effectiveness of private extension systems in developing countries.</descri>

  <title>Cropping intensity gaps: The potential for expanded global harvest areas</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>To feed the world’s growing population, more food needs to be produced. In addition to cropland expansion, which faces a variety of constraints, increasing cropping intensity may provide a promising means of boosting global crop production. Yet information on the size and location of cropping intensity gaps—the difference between the maximum cropping intensity that is theoretically possible and the cropping intensity that is realized today—for current global croplands, and how much additional production can potentially be achieved by closing these gaps, is lacking. To address this issue, this study proposes a spatial approach to exploring cropping intensity gaps around the year 2000. We identify these gaps by estimating the potential multiple cropping systems and actual multiple cropping systems for current global croplands and then calculating the difference. An adapted GAEZ (Global Agro-Ecological Zone) method was used to estimate potential multiple cropping systems on the basis of meteorological data, while actual multiple cropping systems were derived from satellite-based observations. The results show that global average cropping intensity gaps are 0.48 taking temperature constraints into account and 0.17 taking temperature and precipitation constraints into account. The Latin American region has the largest concentration of cropping intensity gaps under both scenarios, followed by Africa and Asia. We also find that most food-insecure countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara, as indicated by higher Global Hunger Index scores, have high or moderate cropping intensity gaps in both scenarios. Reducing the cropping intensity gaps would provide an opportunity to increase food production and help people escape extreme hunger. We estimate that global harvests on current croplands can be expanded by an amount equivalent to another 7.36 million and 2.71 million square kilometers (km2), respectively, under the temperature-limited and the temperature- and precipitation-limited scenarios. Latin America has the largest potential to achieve additional harvest area equivalents (more than 1.28 million km2) by closing cropping intensity gaps, followed by Asia (1.00 million km2). However, it must also be noted that although increasing cropping intensity can boost annual crop production per unit of cropland, this approach is not necessarily always appropriate, and the trade-offs between reducing cropping intensity gaps and caring for the environment must be considered. Only if cropping intensity can be increased sustainably is this a potential strategy for enabling global food production to meet rising food demands.</descri>

  <title>Climate change, food security, and socioeconomic livelihood in Pacific Islands</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Climate change projections internationally accepted as being reliable indicate that most countries in the Pacific region will suffer large-scale negative impacts from climate change. These impacts are likely to include elevated air and sea-surface temperatures, increasingly unpredictable rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and intensification of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones and El Niño-related droughts. Pacific island countries are particularly vulnerable to such climatic changes, since on average, two-thirds of the region’s population depends on agriculture and fisheries for its livelihood and food security. This is certainly true of at least two of the three countries analyzed under the study on which this report is based, the latter including Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Solomon Islands. PNG and Solomon Islands are both vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change since the percentage share of agriculture in total employment is relatively high in both countries (69% in PNG and 68% in Solomon Islands). Similarly, because of their relatively high percentage share of agriculture in the gross domestic product (GDP) (36% in PNG and 39% in Solomon Islands during 2000-2009), the current capacity of both countries for adapting to climate change is limited. </descri>

  <title>Agricultural growth in Ethiopia (2004-2014): Evidence and drivers</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Ethiopia’s agricultural sector has recorded remarkable rapid growth in the last decade. This paper documents aspects of this growth process. Over the last decade, there have been significant increases - more than a doubling - in the use of modern inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and improved seeds, explaining part of that growth. However, there was also significant land expansion, increased labor use, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth, estimated at 2.3 percent per year. The expansion in modern input use appears to have been driven by high government expenditures on the agricultural sector, including agricultural extension, but also by an improved road network, higher rural education levels, and favorable international and local price incentives.</descri>

  <title>Smallholders and land tenure in Ghana: Aligning context, empirics, and policy</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>For decades, policymakers and development practitioners have debated benefits and threats of property rights formalization and private versus customary tenure systems. This paper provides insights into the challenges in understanding and empirically analyzing the relationship between tenure systems and agricultural investment, and formulates policy advice that can support land tenure interventions. We focus on Ghana, based on extensive qualitative fieldwork and a review of empirical research and policy documents. Comparing research findings is challenging due to the use of different indicators, the varying contexts, and the diversity of investments. The interaction between land rights and investment make establishing causality extremely difficult. Setting policy priorities and strategies requires more and better insights into the diverse responses of different stakeholders and the tenure and cropping systems involved.</descri>

  <title>Synopsis, Economics of land degradation and improvement: A global assessment for sustainable development</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The costs of doing nothing about land degradation are several times higher than the costs of taking action to reverse it. Despite the crucial role land plays in human welfare and development, investments in sustainable land management are low, especially in developing countries. These findings come from the book, Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement—A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development, which examines the costs of land degradation and what needs to be done to reverse it. The book reveals the cost of land degradation in case studies for 12 countries, analyzes the drivers, and identifies strategies for sustainable land management. It focuses on two kinds of land degradation: long-term loss of value of land ecosystem services due to land use and cover change (LUCC) and the use of land-degrading management practices on cropland and grazing lands that do not undergo LUCC. Six major biomes that accounted for about 86 percent of global land area in 2001 are covered, including forest, shrub lands, grasslands, cropland, barren land, and woodlands. Thirty-three percent of grasslands, 25 percent of croplands, and 23 percent of forests experienced degradation over the last three decades.</descri>

  <title>2014-2015 Global food policy report</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This 2014–2015 Global Food Policy Report is the fourth in an annual series that provides a comprehensive overview of major food policy developments and events. In this report, distinguished researchers, policymakers, and practitioners review what happened in food policy in 2014 at the global, regional, and national levels, and—supported by the latest knowledge and research—explain why. This year’s report is the first to also look forward a year, offering analysis of the potential opportunities and challenges that we will face in achieving food and nutrition security in 2015. The year 2014 was marked by advances and setbacks in agriculture, food security, and nutrition. The Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015 was achieved. World food prices fell to their lowest level since 2010. Nutrition remained prominent: the Second International Conference on Nutrition in Rome proposed actions to end malnutrition, membership in the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement expanded, and new research highlighted the importance of factors such as water and sanitation and the role of women in battling malnutrition. Debate began on the draft post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, sharpening the world’s focus on the building blocks of food and nutrition security. Significant commitments to combating climate change were made, particularly by China and the United States. Middle income countries, home to the majority of the world’s hungry and malnourished people, continued their efforts to improve food security and nutrition at home, with Brazil and China, for example, expanding investments in agriculture and knowledge and technology transfers with the global South.</descri>

  <title>Synopsis of 2014 Global hunger index: The challenge of hidden hunger</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The 2014 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report—the ninth in an annual series—presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger. It shows that the world has made progress in reducing hunger since 1990, but still has far to go, with levels of hunger remaining “alarming” or “extremely alarming” in 16 countries. This year’s report focuses on a critical aspect of hunger that is often overlooked: hidden hunger. Also known as micronutrient deficiency, hidden hunger affects more than an estimated 2 billion people globally. The repercussions of these vitamin and mineral deficiencies are both serious and long-lasting. Where hidden hunger has taken root, it not only prevents people from surviving and thriving as productive members of society, it also holds countries back in a cycle of poor nutrition, poor health, lost productivity, persistent poverty, and reduced economic growth.</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study aims to explore and quantify systematic similarities and differences between four major global cropping systems products: the dataset of monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000), the spatial production allocation model (SPAM), the global agroecological zone (GAEZ) dataset, and the M3 dataset developed by Monfreda, Ramankutty, and Foley. The analysis explores not only the final cropping systems maps but also the interdependencies of each product, methodological differences, and modeling assumptions, which will provide users with information vital for discerning between datasets in selecting a product appropriate for each intended application.</descri>

  <title>The changing landscape of agriculture in Ghana: Drivers of farm mechanization and its impacts on cropland expansion and intensification</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study assesses whether the recent public and private efforts to improve farmers’ access to mechanical power in Ghana have had the intended effects on the country’s agricultural sector. Using panel survey data, this paper analyses the drivers of farm mechanization and its net impacts on cropland expansion and farming system intensification in northern Ghana. Several factors explain the use and use intensity of agricultural mechanization, including landholding size, total labor and fertilizer use per hectare, chemical use, and amount of land left fallow. More importantly, the results suggest that farm mechanization did have a positive impact on cropland expansion during the survey period. The results presented here support the existence of a labor substitution effect resulting from tractor use.</descri>

  <descri>Alors qu’il ne reste plus qu’une année avant la date d’échéance de la réalisation des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement, l’Indice de la faim dans le monde 2014 (GHI) offre une analyse multidimensionnelle de la faim et présente de nouvelles données permettant d’alimenter le débat mondial sur la question de savoir où concentrer les efforts dans la lutte contre la faim et la malnutrition. Selon le GHI 2014, les niveaux de faim dans les pays en développement pris dans leur ensemble se sont améliorés depuis 1990, diminuant de 39%. Malgré les progrès enregistrés, le niveau de la faim dans le monde demeure « grave » avec 805 millions de personnes qui continuent de souffrir de la faim, selon des estimations de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO).</descri>

  <title>Taking stock of national agricultural R&D capacity in Africa south of the Sahara</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This report is timely input into the ongoing development agenda for Africa South of the Sahara (SSA). The 2013 report on agriculture and food systems by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network released a set of post–2015 development goals, including recommendations that lowand middle-income countries increase their spending on agricultural research and development (R&D) by a minimum of 5 percent per year during 2015–2025, and that they allocate at least 1 percent of their agricultural gross development product (GDP) to public agricultural R&D.1 More recently, the Science Agenda for Agriculture in Africa was adopted at the African Heads of State Summit, necessitating the development of a continent-wide implementation plan. This report, which summarizes SSA’s recent progress in developing its national agricultural R&D systems, is intended to serve as an important input into, and potential benchmark for, the implementation of the science agenda in SSA and the broader development agenda for the region.</descri>

  <title>Bilan des capacités de R&D agricole nationale en Afrique au sud du Sahara</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Ce document vise à  contribuer au programme d’action en cours pour le développement de l’Afrique au sud du Sahara. Le rapport 2013 sur l’agriculture et les systèmes alimentaires du Réseau des solutions pour le développement durable des Nations Unies a présenté une série d’objectifs de développement pour l’après-2015, dont des recommandations exhortant les pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire à accroître leurs dépenses en R&D d’au moins 5 % par an sur la période 2015–2025, et à consacrer au moins 1 % de leur PIB agricole à la R&D agricole.[1] Plus récemment, la Conférence des chefs d’État africains a entériné le Plan d’action scientifique pour l’agriculture de l’Afrique, nécessitant l’élaboration d’un plan de mise en oeuvre à l’échelle du continent. Cette synthèse des récents progrès dans le développement des systèmes nationaux de R&D agricole vise à soutenir la mise en oeuvre du plan d’action scientifique et du calendrier de développement régional, et à servir d’outil de référence. L’analyse est fondée sur l’ensemble de données primaires détaillées du programme ASTI sur les indicateurs relatifs aux sciences et aux technologies agricoles, dont la compilation la plus récente date de 2012–2013.</descri>

  <title>Low emission development strategies for agriculture and other land uses: The case of Colombia</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The purpose of the work presented in this report is to demonstrate that policymakers have tools at their disposal that provide significant help in the evaluation of trade-offs, opportunities, and repercussions of the policies under consideration. This report focuses on Colombia, however the analytical framework can be applied to any country interested in exploring country-wide effects and economic viability of policies that aim to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture. Results provided in this study should be seen as an example of the potential applications of the framework developed. We were able to identify policies covering the entire spectrum of potential outcomes: win-win policies (reduce land allocated to pasture), policies with tradeoffs (reduce deforestation in the Amazon) and policies that seem to generate clearly inferior results (increase the area allocate to palm cultivation).</descri>

  <descri>Almost two decades have passed since China first enacted legislation to protect farmland from conversion to nonagricultural use. Yet hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land are still developed to urban area each year, raising the question of whether the legislation is effective in preserving farmland from development. This paper examines the effectiveness of the Basic Farmland Protection Regulation in protecting high-quality farmland from urban development in China in the first decade after it came into effect (1995‒2005).</descri>

The study first uses satellite data on land change (Landsat) to examine land use change in 1990–2010 and its impact on sediment loading in hydroelectric power plants. The study then uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to analyze the impact of land use change and land management on sediment loading. The results from the land use change and SWAT analyses are used to assess the economic benefits of SLM.</descri>

  <title>The challenge of Africa’s nitrogen drought: Some indicators from the Malawian experience</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Years of continuous cultivation with little or no use of external inputs to restore soil nutrients has resulted in a situation in which crop production in a number of African countries is now limited by nutrient deficiencies – nitrogen, in particular, which is crucial to healthy plant growth. This widespread problem has been described as a “nitrogen drought”. Attempts to remedy this situation using only organic inputs have largely failed to keep up with the rate of nutrient loss. This policy note uses Malawi as an example of a country facing these conditions and in which the level of household food production is largely determined by the availability of nitrogen in the soil.</descri>

Cette annee, le GHI se concentre sur un aspect particulier de la faim souvent neglige : la faim invisible. Egalement connue sous la forme de carences en micro-nutriments, la faim invisible touche plus de 2 milliards de personnes dans le monde. Les consequences de ces carences en vitamines et en mineraux sont a la fois graves et perennes. La faim invisible n’empeche pas seulement les personnes qui en sont affectees de survivre et de devenir des membres actifs de la societe, elle ramene egalement les pays dans des cycles de malnutrition, de mauvaise sante, de pertes de productivite, de pauvrete persistante et de croissance economique reduite.</descri>

  <title>2014 Global hunger index: The challenge of hidden hunger</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>With one more year before the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the 2014 Global Hunger Index report offers a multifaceted overview of global hunger that brings new insights to the global debate on where to focus efforts in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. The state of hunger in developing countries as a group has improved since 1990, falling by 39 percent, according to the 2014 GHI. Despite progress made, the level of hunger in the world is still “serious,” with 805 million people continuing to go hungry, according to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Ein Jahr bevor die Frist zur Erreichung der Millenniums-Entwicklungsziele im Jahr 2015 abläuft, bietet der Welthunger-Index (WHI) einen facettenreichen Überblick über die Verbreitung des Hungers und trägt neue Erkenntnisse darüber in die weltweite Debatte, wie Hunger und Mangelernährung verringert werden können. Betrachtet man die Entwicklungsländer als Gruppe, so hat sich die Hungersituation dort seit 1990 verbessert. Dem WHI 2014 zufolge ist seitdem ein Rückgang um 39 Prozent zu verzeichnen. Trotz dieser Fortschritte ist der Hunger in der Welt weiterhin als „ernst“ einzustufen: Nach Schätzungen der Ernährungs- und Landwirtschaftsorganisation der Vereinten Nationen (Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO) hungern weltweit immer noch 805 Millionen Menschen.</descri>

  <title>Synopse Welthunger-Index 2014: Herausforderung verborgener Hunger</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Der Welthunger-Index (WHI) 2014 stellt die nationale, regionale und weltweite Hungersituation zum neunten Mal in jahrlicher Folge multidimensional dar. Er zeigt, dass bei der globalen Hungerbekampfung seit 1990 Fortschritte erzielt werden konnten, jedoch angesichts sehr ernster oder gar gravierender Hungerwerte in 16 Landern noch immer groser Handlungsbedarf besteht. Der Schwerpunkt dieses Berichts liegt auf einem entscheidenden Aspekt des Hungers, der haufig ubersehen wird, dem verborgenen Hunger. Verborgener Hunger – auch Mikronahrstoffmangel genannt – betrifft Schatzungen zufolge mehr als zwei Milliarden Menschen weltweit. Dieser Mangel an Vitaminen und Mineralstoffen kann ernste und langfristige Folgen haben. Wo verborgener Hunger verbreitet ist, gefahrdet er nicht nur das Uberleben und beschrankt die Entfaltung der Menschen als produktive Mitglieder ihrer Gesellschaft, sondern halt ganze Lander gefangen in einem Kreislauf aus unzureichender Ernahrung, schlechter Gesundheit, Produktivitatsverlusten, fortdauernder Armut und vermindertem wirtschaftlichen Wachstum</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>A un anno dalla scadenza per il raggiungimento degli Obiettivi di Sviluppo del Millennio, fissata nel 2015, l’Indice Globale della Fame 2014 offre una prospettiva articolata del problema della fame nel mondo, che porta nuovi spunti al dibattito mondiale rispetto a dove concentrare gli sforzi nella lotta contro la fame e la malnutrizione. Secondo il GHI 2014, lo stato della fame nei Paesi in via di sviluppo è complessivamente migliorato in confronto al 1990, con un calo del 39%. Nonostante i progressi fatti, la situazione mondiale è ancora “grave”, con 805 milioni di persone che continuano a soffrire la fame, secondo le stime dell’Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite per l’Agricoltura e l’Alimentazione (FAO).</descri>

  <title>What's politics got to do with it: Nutrition and the policy agenda</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Recent experience has shown that as countries get richer, nutritional status does not necessarily improve. In a recent article in the journal The Lancet, IFPRI researchers and others explain that creating the right conditions for nutritional advances often requires political action. The feature article in this issue of Insights looks at how some developing countries and regions—Ghana, Peru, Thailand, and the state of Maharashtra, India—have made nutrition a political priority and how they’ve turned political commitments into widespread changes on the ground. The rest of this issue of Insights describes other important IFPRI research, touching on many  different areas related to food policy.</descri>

  <title>East African agriculture and climate change: A comprehensive analysis</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The second of three books in IFPRI's climate change in Africa series, East African Agriculture and Climate Change: A Comprehensive Analysis examines the food security threats facing 10 of the countries that make up east and central Africa - Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda - and explores how climate change will increase the efforts needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the region. East Africa's populations is expected to grow at least through mid-century. The region will also see income growth. Both will put increased pressure on the natural resources needed to produce food, and climate change makes the challenges greater. East Africa is already experiencing rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasing extreme events. Without attention to adaptation, the poor will suffer.</descri>

  <descri>This study employs IFPRI’s IMPACT model to generate projections of global fi sh supply and demand. IMPACT covers the world in 115 model regions for a range of agricultural commodities, to which fi sh and fi sh products are added for this study. As is the case with most global modeling work, an important value that IMPACT brings to this study is an internally consistent framework for analyzing and organizing the underlying data. However, there are known data and methodology issues that arise from choices made by the key researchers for the purposes of maintaining computational tractability, internal analytical consistency, and overall simplicity.</descri>

  <title>2013 Indice globale della fame : La sfida della fame : Sviluppare la resilienza delle comunità per la sicurezza alimentare e nutrizionale</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Nel 2012 la tempesta tropicale Isaac e l’uragano Sandy hanno martoriato Haiti, danneggiando i raccolti, facendo straripare i fiumi, alla­gando le strade e bloccando l’accesso alle comunità. Mentre i prezzi ali­mentari aumentavano e i debiti crescevano, gli haitiani poveri hanno adot­tato misure estreme. Alcuni sono emigrati. Altri hanno resistito riducendo il numero di pasti al giorno e svendendo le proprie terre o il bestiame. Ogni estate, gli haitiani temono lo scatenarsi della furia degli elementi. Che si tratti di tempeste o di un periodo di siccità come quello che nel 2012 ha lasciato 18 milioni di affamati nel Sahel, o di altri eventi climati­ci estremi, dell'impennata dei prezzi alimentari o di una prolungata instabilità politica, le crisi e gli shock continuano a colpire i poveri e i più vulnerabili. Troppo spesso, coloro che non sono in grado di reagire si ritrovano ad affond­are nella povertà, a dover affrontare la malnutrizione e la fame.È ormai chiaro che non basta aiutare le popolazioni povere e vul­nerabili a sopravvivere agli shock a breve termine. Queste popolazioni sono tra quelle maggiormente colpite dagli shock - causati dall’uomo o naturali - e meno in grado di farvi fronte; per cui, essendovi costantemente esposte, non è facile per loro migliorare la propria condizione. Le popo­lazioni povere e vulnerabili devono incrementare la propria resilienza; e una parte essenziale del processo di sviluppo della resilienza consiste nel rafforzare la sicurezza alimentare e nutrizionale. Dato che l’accesso a un’alimentazione sana e adeguata è un diritto umano fondamentale, è di vitale importanza che tutti noi adottiamo misure per sviluppare la resilien­za migliorando la sicurezza alimentare e nutrizionale. La resilienza è il tema centrale dell’Indice Globale della Fame 2013, pubblicato congiuntamente da International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Concern Worldwide e Welthungerhilfe. Dato che secon­do l’Indice la fame nel mondo resta “grave”, con 19 Paesi a livello “allar­mante” o “estremamente allarmante”, promuovere la resilienza è fonda­mentale per aumentare la sicurezza alimentare e nutrizionale.</descri>

  <title>2013 Welthunger-Index : Herausforderung Hunger : Widerstandsfähigkeit stärken Ernährung sichern</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Die globale Hungersituation hat sich seit 1990 verbessert, wie der Welthunger-Index 2013 anhand von Daten aus dem Zeitraum 2008-2012 zeigt. Der WHI ist um ein Drittel gesunken. Dennoch ist die weltweite Hungersituation nach wie vor „ernst“. 870 Millionen Men­schen hatten laut Schätzungen der Ernährungs- und Landwirtschafts­organisation der Vereinten Nationen (FAO) im Mittel der Jahre 2010-2012 nicht genug zu essen. Südasien und Afrika südlich der Sahara haben die höchsten WHI-Werte. Südasien hat seinen WHI-Wert zwischen 1990 und 1995 deutlich verbessert, vor allem durch einen großen Rückgang des Untergewichts bei Kindern. Der schnelle Fortschritt in dieser Region konnte jedoch nicht aufrechterhalten werden. Soziale Ungleichheit und der schlechte Ernährungszustand, das geringe Bildungsniveau und der niedrige gesellschaftliche Status von Frauen tragen nach wie vor zu einem hohen Anteil von Untergewicht bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren bei. Afrika südlich der Sahara konnte in den 1990er-Jahren den Hun­ger nicht so stark reduzieren wie Südasien. Seit der Jahrtausendwende hat die Region jedoch deutliche Fortschritte gemacht; ihr WHI-Wert liegt nun unter dem von Südasien. Größere politische Stabilität in den Län­dern, die in den 1990er- und 2000er-Jahren von Bürgerkriegen betrof­fen waren, ermöglichte wirtschaftliches Wachstum. Fortschritte im Kampf gegen HIV und AIDS, Erfolge bei der Malariabekämpfung und höhere Impfraten trugen zu einer Senkung der Kindersterblichkeit bei. Seit 1990 haben 23 Länder deutliche Fortschritte gemacht und ihre WHI-Werte um 50 Prozent oder mehr gesenkt. 27 Länder konnten die Kategorien „gravierend“ und „sehr ernst“ verlassen. Die folgenden zehn Länder haben seit 1990 die größten absoluten Fortschritte erzielt: Angola, Äthiopien, Bangladesch, Ghana, Kambodscha, Malawi, Niger, Ruanda, Thailand und Vietnam.</descri>

  <title>2013 Global hunger index : The challenge of hunger : Building resilience to achieve food and nutrition security</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The 2013 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report-the eighth in an annual series- presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger. It shows that the world has made some progress in reducing hunger since 1990, but still has far to go. The 2013 GHI report focuses on resilience in theory and in practice. The relief and development communities have long struggled to understand why some people fare better than others when confronting stresses or shocks. Given that world hunger remains “serious” according to the index, resilience-building efforts are much needed to help poor and vulnerable people cope with hunger seasons, droughts, and other natural and manmade disasters both short-term and long-term. Building resilience will involve boosting food and nutrition security. In order to achieve that goal, the humanitarian and development communities must work together.</descri>

  <title>2013 Indice de la faim dans le monde : Le défi de la faim : Construire la résilience pour une sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle durable</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>L’Indice de la faim dans le monde 2013 (GHI), élaboré à partir de données couvrant la période 2008-2012, montre que le niveau de la faim dans le monde s’est amélioré depuis 1990, diminuant d’un tiers. En dépit des progrès réalisés, le niveau de la faim demeure « grave », avec 870 millions de personnes souffrant de la faim selon des estimations de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO). Les scores GHI varient considérablement en fonction des régions et des pays. L’Asie du Sud et l’Afrique subsaharienne concentrent les scores GHI les plus élevés. L’Asie du Sud a diminué son score GHI entre 1990 et 1995 de manière significative grâce, en particulier, à une baisse importante de l’insuffisance pondérale infantile, mais n’est pas parvenue à maintenir ce rythme de progression. Les inégalités sociales ainsi que le faible statut nutritionnel, éducationnel et social des femmes continuent de contribuer à une prévalence élevée de l’insuffisance pondérale chez les enfants de moins de cinq ans.L’Afrique subsaharienne n’a pas accompli autant de progrès que l’Asie du Sud au cours des années 1990. Toutefois, depuis le passage à l’an 2000, ce continent a réalisé des progrès notables et son score GHI est actuellement inférieur à celui de l’Asie du Sud. L’avènement d’une plus grande stabilité politique dans des pays anciennement touchés par des guerres civiles dans les années 1990 et 2000 s’est traduit par une reprise de la croissance économique. Des avancées dans la lutte contre le VIH/Sida, une diminution de la prévalence du paludisme et des taux de vaccination plus élevés ont contribué à réduire la mortalité infantile. Depuis 1990, 23 pays ont réalisé des progrès significatifs, réduisant leurs scores GHI de 50% voire plus. 27 pays sont passés de la catégorie « extrêmement alarmant » à « alarmant ». En termes de progrès absolus, les dix pays ayant connu les meilleures améliorations de leur score GHI sont l’Angola, le Bangladesh, le Cambodge, l’Ethiopie, le Ghana, le Malawi, le Niger, le Rwanda, la Thaïlande et le Vietnam.</descri>

  <title>2013 Global hunger index : The challenge of hunger : Building resilience to achieve food and nutrition security</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The 2013 Global Hunger Index (GHI), which reflects data from the period 2008-2012, shows that global hunger has improved since 1990, falling by one-third. Despite the progress made, the level of hunger in the world remains “serious,” with 870 million people going hungry, according to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organiza­tion of the United Nations.Across regions and countries, GHI scores vary considerably. South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara are home to the highest GHI scores. South Asia significantly lowered its GHI score between 1990 and 1995, mainly thanks to a large decline in underweight in children, but was not able to maintain its fast progress. Social inequality and the low nutritional, educational, and social status of women continue to contrib­ute to the high prevalence of underweight in children under five. Africa south of the Sahara did not advance as much as South Asia in the 1990s. Since the turn of the millennium, however, Africa south of the Sahara has shown real progress, and its GHI score is now lower than South Asia’s. More political stability in countries earlier affect­ed by civil wars in the 1990s and 2000s meant economic growth could resume. Advances in the fight against HIV and AIDS, a decrease in the prevalence of malaria, and higher immunization rates contributed to a reduction in child mortality. Since 1990, 23 countries made significant progress, reducing their GHI scores by 50 percent or more. Twenty-seven countries moved out of the “extremely alarming” and “alarming” categories. In terms of absolute progress, the top ten countries in terms of improvements in GHI scores since 1990 were Angola, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Niger, Rwanda, Thailand, and Vietnam.</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The agriculture, nutrition, and health nexus came to prominence in 2011. With 1 billion people continuing to suffer from food insecurity, and with vitamin and mineral deficiencies compromising the nutrition and health of billions of people, the international development community began to ask how much more could agriculture do to improve human wellbeing if it explicitly included nutrition and health goals? What kind of changes could maximize agriculture’s contribution to human health and nutrition, and how could improved human health and nutrition contribute to a more productive and sustainable agricultural system?</descri>

  <title>Ensuring food and nutrition security in a green economy</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>As the population continues to grow and natural resources become scarcer, the need to shift toward an environmen­tally responsible, socially accountable, more equitable, and “greener” economy has become increasingly apparent. Despite differing perspectives and definitions among stakeholders, the “green economy” is often seen as an economy that pursues growth while also promoting sustainable development through more efficient use of resources. Thus aligned with concepts of sustainability, the objective of a green economy is to simultaneously work toward economic development, environmental protection, and greater social welfare, in particular by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and nonrenewable resources.</descri>

  <title>Managing conflicts over land and natural resources through collective action</title>
  <subtit>A case study from rural communities in Zambia</subtit>
  <descri>Seasonal changes and ambiguity in property rights over land and natural resources create conflicts in rural communities in eastern Zambia. This study describes how rural households have minimized such conflicts and protect the economic interests of the poor members of the community through collective agreements on how to manage access to land and natural resources. Specifically, this study describes and evaluates the formulation and implementation of bylaws governing the grazing of animals and the setting of bush fires. First, we describe the background of the social conflicts arising over land and natural resources and the collective agreements to reduce the conflicts, as well as the processes that led to the formulation of the agreements. Using a sample survey of 196 households, we conduct an ex post assessment of the perceived effectiveness of the bylaws, including planned and unplanned impacts of the bylaws. The study shows that collective agreements and dialogues provide important entry points to minimize conflicts over natural resources. Survey results reveal a remarkable increase in the perceived effectiveness of the bylaw on animal grazing over a five year period (from 16 to 46 percent of respondents describing it as “effective”), with a more modest change regarding the bylaw governing bush fires. A number of lessons and recommendations are drawn from the study: (1) collective action can be used to protect the interests of the poor members in the community (especially female-headed households) and raise their voices in matters that affect their livelihood; (2) collective action is not a panacea, especially where power structure is skewed; (3) ex post assessment of the outcomes of collective action is essential to understand planned (positive) and unplanned (negative) outcomes; (4) cultural practices are constantly changing over time and may become opportunities or constraints depending on how communities organize themselves to protect the interests of both the powerful and vulnerable groups</descri>

  <title>Informe de políticas alimentarias mundiales 2011</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Desde 2007, se produjeron dos rondas de picos de los precios de los alimentos que han contribuido a que al hambre y la malnutrición de millones de personas. Los mismos factores que contribuyeron a la crisis de los precios de los alimentos de 2007-08 dispararon picos de precios similares en 2011; entre tales factores se incluyen la caída de la tasa de crecimiento agrícola, los altos precios de la energía que impulsan la expansión de la producción de biocombustibles, la depreciación del dólar estadounidense, una fuerte demanda de productos agrícolas por parte de las economías emergentes, y las crisis climáticas. Dada esta combinación de fuerzas complejas, resulta claro que las políticas alimentarias necesarias para garantizar que todas las personas tengan acceso a alimentos sanos, suficientes, nutritivos y cultivados de manera sostenible deben ir más allá de la producción agrícola tradicional. Por consiguiente, no resulta sorprendente que la demanda de investigación capaz de fundamentar con datos empíricos dichas políticas sea más alta que nunca, y el Instituto internacional de investigación sobre políticas alimentarias (IFPRI) produce bienes públicos mundiales para responder a esa necesidad.</descri>

  <title>2011 Politiques alimentaires mondiales rapport</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Depuis 2007, deux séries successives d’envolée des prix des denrées alimentaires ont causé la faim ou la malnutrition pour des millions de personnes dans le monde. Les mêmes facteurs qui avaient contribué à la hausse des prix en 2007-2008 ont refait surface en 2011 et ont pour nom : la baisse du taux de croissance de la productivité agricole, le niveau élevé du coût de l’énergie favorisant l’expansion de la production de biocarburants, la dépréciation du dollar américain, une forte demande des pays émergents en matière de produits agricoles et les bouleversements climatiques. Avec autant de facteurs en jeu, il est clair que les politiques alimentaires nécessaires pour assurer de façon durable l’accès à une alimentation saine, en quantité et en qualité suffisantes pour des millions de personnes, doivent transcender la production agricole traditionnelle. En conséquence, la demande de recherches fondées sur des données probantes susceptibles de soutenir ces politiques est plus forte que jamais. A cet effet, L’Institut international de recherche sur les politiques alimentaires (IFPRI) a mis à la disposition de la communauté internationale un grand nombre de résultats analytiques et autres produits de connaissance pour contribuer à répondre à cette demande.</descri>

  <title>Economics of land degradation</title>
  <subtit>The costs of action versus inaction</subtit>
  <descri>In recent years, prices of agricultural land have increased quickly, actually doubling and tripling in many parts of the world. This land value reassessment has been prompted by rising crop prices and perceived land scarcity. But even as the value of land rises, land degradation continues and investments to prevent it are lagging. Awareness of environmental risks has moved to the forefront of global consciousness during the past 25 years. However, this awareness has not translated into comprehensive action to address the problem of land degradation, which poses a serious threat to long-term food security. This inaction is primarily the result of limited knowledge of the costs related to land degradation and of insufficient institutional support. Policy action and research are needed to resolve this paradox of high-value land and low levels of investment.</descri>

  <title>Agricultural management for climate change adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation, and agricultural productivity""</title>
  <subtit>Insights from Kenya</subtit>
  <descri>Changes in the agriculture sector are essential to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensure food security for the growing population, and improve the livelihoods of poor smallholder producers. What agricultural strategies are needed to meet these challenges? To what extent are there synergies among these strategies? This paper examines these issues for smallholder producers in Kenya. Several practices emerge as triple wins in terms of climate adaptation, GHG mitigation, and productivity and profitability. In particular, integrated soil fertility management and improved livestock feeding are shown to provide multiple benefits across the agroecological zones examined. In addition, irrigation and soil and water conservation are also shown to be essential in the arid zone. The results suggest that agricultural investments targeted towards triple-win strategies will have the greatest payoff in terms of increased resilience of farm and pastoralist households to climate change, rural development, and climate change mitigation for generations to come.</descri>

  <title>Heterogeneous treatment effects of integrated soil fertility management on crop productivity</title>
  <subtit>Evidence from Nigeria</subtit>
  <descri>This study compares the impacts of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) on crop production with use of either mineral fertilizer or organic manure alone. We also investigate the conditions under which .ISFM technology has greater beneficial effects on yields and the factors constraining its uptake. To answer these questions, the study uses a cross-sectional, plot-level data set collected in Nigeria by the International Food Policy Research Institute and the World Bank in 2009. Using both quasi experimental matching estimators and multivariate regression approaches, it finds that overall ISFM has robustly significant positive effects on crop production. The study also finds that ISFM positively affects crop production on plots with customary tenure, sandy soils, and clay soils—conditions that are normally perceived to be less favorable for crop production. The results also show ISFM to be more effective on plots with mild erosion or no erosion. On the constraints, we find that households with limited livestock, equipment, labor, and land are less likely to use ISFM technology, and the extension services currently do not seem to be disseminating ISFM. This evidence provides strong support for efforts to promote ISFM in Nigeria and in other regions with comparable conditions, but adequate attention must be paid to the biophysical conditions of the plots and the household’s access to labor endowments, livestock, equipment, and tenure conditions if this technology is to be scaled up and more widely used in Sub-Saharan Africa.</descri>

  <descri>Empirical evidence has shown that farmers can adapt to climate change by using sustainable land and water management (SLWM) practices that provide local mitigation benefits, reducing or offsetting the negative effects of climate change at the level of the plot, farm, or even landscape. However, adaptation to climate change using SLWM practices in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains low. This study was conducted to examine the impact of government policies on adaptation to climate change.</descri>

  <title>The economics of desertification, land degradation, and drought</title>
  <subtit>Toward an integrated global assessment</subtit>
  <descri>Attention to land degradation and environmental pollution has increased significantly in the past 25 years, largely due to greater levels of international cooperation and recognition that local changes in land resources have global impacts. As the world’s focus on climate change increases, so, too, does the attention being paid to drought and its rise in frequency and severity. Despite this heightened global awareness, action to prevent or mitigate land degradation and drought at national or international levels has been limited, primarily because there are limited assessments regarding the cost of land degradation. Past global assessments have largely focused on the biophysical impacts of land degradation while little has been done to assess its global economic costs or the costs-versus-benefits of preventing or mitigating it. Additionally, past studies have largely focused on loss of on-site productivity and have paid limited attention to the off-site costs of land degradation and off-site benefits of land improvement. As part of the effort to address these and other gaps, this study was undertaken to prepare a framework for global assessment of the economics of desertification, land degradation, and drought (E-DLDD).</descri>

  <title>Common-pool resources, livelihoods, and resilience</title>
  <subtit>Critical challenges for governance in Cambodia</subtit>
  <descri>Common-pool resource management is a critical element in the interlocked challenges of food security, nutrition, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. This paper examines strategic policy choices and governance challenges facing Cambodia‘s forests and fisheries, the most economically important subsectors of agriculture that rely on common-pool resources. It then outlines policy priorities for institutional development to achieve improvements in implementing these goals. The core argument is that (1) policy support for community-based management in forestry and fisheries requires explicit prioritization to protect against threats from other types of private- and public-sector investment; and (2) the success of these initiatives depends on more systemic governance reforms that address issues of stakeholder representation, mechanisms of accountability, and institutional capacity.</descri>

  <title>Responding to land degradation in the highlands of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Improving the long-term sustainability and resilience of smallholder agriculture in Africa is highly dependent on conserving or improving the quality of the natural resource. Conservation agriculture is conceived around more integrated and effective management strategies for provisioning both food and other ecosystem services. If unattended to, land degradation would reduce agricultural productivity and increase pressure on marginal environments in the Tigray highlands of Ethiopia, adversely affecting food security and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. This paper answers some pertinent questions about mass mobilization of free compulsory labor for ecological restoration in Tigray. It details perception of changes in climate; the process of collective decisionmaking; resistance, documentation, and enforcement of rules; methods of conflict resolution; knowledge and information networks; arrangements for benefit sharing of communal resources; and the role of gender in mass mobilization for communal work. We analyzed data collected from 20 villages in 3 districts in the Tigray region through a household survey using a structured questionnaire, focus group discussions, and personal observations. The results reveal that the people are motivated to provide their free labor to restore the ecology to increase agricultural productivity and production to avoid food insecurity and improve their general livelihood. Availability of institutions in terms of grassroots organizations and rules and regulations was a major factor in the positive response to the call for action. The commitment of the government at both the national and local levels (through sensitization and mobilization for group formation and provision of tools and construction materials); the ethnic homogeneity of the population; and the existence of the Orthodox Church, where most of the people were members, were major factors for the success of the community mobilization for collective action in Tigray. Social networking with neighbors, the clergy, and leaders of grassroots organizations provided the knowledge and information on climate variability and solutions required to conserve the ecology and improve human livelihood. We also observed that there were no differences in gender division of labor except that women worked half the workload of men in a day; the women also did the cooking and cleaned up the surroundings after eating at the site. Both men and women played active roles in leadership with regard to mobilization of people, communal work planning and scheduling, conflict resolution, and sharing of community products. An impact assessment of the ecological conservation in Tigray on agricultural productivity and production and food security would be useful. It will be interesting to replicate the study in other areas in Ethiopia and other countries where the societies may not be homogenous to find out the level of commitment of the people to communal work.</descri>

  <title>Catalyzing collective action to address natural resource conflict</title>
  <subtit>Lessons from Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake</subtit>
  <descri>This paper reports on outcomes and lessons learned from a 15-month initiative aimed at strengthening collective action to address natural resource conflict in Cambodia’s Tonle Sap Lake. Employing the Appreciation-Influence-Control (AIC) model of participatory stakeholder engagement, the initiative aimed in particular to build collective understanding of the sources of vulnerability in fisheries livelihoods and to catalyze efforts to support resilience in this valuable and productive socialecological system. Outcomes include important shifts in fishery access rights and resource management authority—notably the transfer of a large, commercial fishing concession to community access, and the resolution of a boundary dispute involving community fishery organizations in neighboring provinces. Motivated by such successes in collaborative problem analysis and advocacy, the main national grassroots network representing fishing communities have also modified its internal governance and strategy of engagement to emphasize constructive links with government and the formal NGO sector. The experience demonstrates the potential of such an open-ended process of action research to enable collective action and improve natural resource governance, even amidst ongoing resource conflict. We conclude with a set of lessons learned to guide such efforts in practice.</descri>

  <title>Bâtir sur les succès de l’agriculture Africaine</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Les nouvelles sur l’état de l’agriculture en Afrique sont en grande partie décourageantes, mais on entrevoit des lueurs d'espoir. Quelques efforts stimulants réalisés par des agriculteurs et chercheurs africains au cours des dix dernières années ont sensiblement augmenté la productivité agricole dans certains pays et pour certains produits. Ces cas peuvent servir de modèles pour de futurs efforts, mais seulement si les responsables des politiques de développement et les professionnels comprennent les processus qui ont amené ces résultats, et les éléments clé de leur succès. Pour accorder une plus grande attention à ces épisodes et pour aider diffuser les leçons qu’on peut en tirer, l‘IFPRI et plusieurs partenaires ont lancé un projet visant à identifier et à comprendre les succès récents de l’agriculture africaine.

  <title>Agroenvironmental transformation in the Sahel</title>
  <subtit>Another kind of "Green Revolution"</subtit>
  <descri>A farmer-managed, agroenvironmental transformation has occurred over the past three decades in the West African Sahel, enabling both land rehabilitation and agricultural intensification to support a dense and growing population. This paper traces the technical and institutional innovations, their impacts, and lessons learned from two successful examples. The first is the story of the improvement and replication of indigenous soil and water conservation practices across the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. Rehabilitation of at least 200,000 hectares of degraded land enabled farmers to grow cereals on land that had been barren and intensify production through developing agroforestry systems. Additionally, rehabilitation appears to have recharged local wells. The second example is a farmer-managed process of natural regeneration, using improved, local agroforestry practices over an estimated 5 million hectares in southern Niger. This large-scale effort reduced wind erosion and increased the production and marketing of crops, fodder, firewood, fruit, and other products. In both cases, income opportunities were created, reducing incentives for migration. Women benefited from the improved supply of water, fuelwood, and other tree products. Human, social, and political capital was strengthened in a process of farmer-driven change. Fluid coalitions of actors expanded the scale of the transformation. These stories have important lessons for those who seek to create effective agricultural development partnerships and meet the challenges of climate change and food security.</descri>

  <title>Agriculture and climate change: An agenda for negotiation in Copenhagen</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Agriculture and climate change are inextricably linked. Agriculture is part of the climate change problem, contributing about 13.5 percent of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (with forestry contributing an additional 19 percent), compared with 13.1 percent from transportation. Agriculture is, however, also part of the solution, offering promising opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions through carbon sequestration, soil and land use management, and biomass production. Climate change threatens agricultural production through higher and more variable temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased occurrences of extreme events such as droughts and floods. And if agriculture is not included, or not well included, in the international climate change negotiations leading up to the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December 2009, resulting climate change policies could threaten poor farming communities and smallholders in many developing countries. The policies could also impede the ability of smallholders to partake in new economic opportunities that might arise from the negotiations.

  <title>Respondiendo a la crisis alimentaria mundial: Tres perspectivas</title>
  <subtit>IFPRI 2007-2008 Annual Report Essay</subtit>
  <descri>El dramático aumento y la volatilidad de los precios de los alimentos durante el último año han sacudido al sistema alimentario mundial. Por lo general, tanto los gobiernos como la comunidad dedicada al desarrollo internacional han respondido ante diversos aspectos de la crisis alimentaria, pero todavía permanecen las preguntas sobre si se han tomado o no las acciones más adecuadas, cuál es la mejor forma de responder y qué nos aguarda en el futuro. Estos tres ensayos de Namanga Ngongi, presidente de la Alianza para una Revolución Verde en África; Josette Sheeran, directora ejecutiva del Programa Mundial de  Alimentos; y Joachim von Braun, director general del Instituto Internacional de Investigación sobre Políticas Alimentarias, responden a estas críticas preguntas. Los autores señalan los peligros y los escollos de las políticas mal encaminadas, pero también las oportunidades reales que existen para responder de forma tal que se eviten futuras crisis y se vele por la seguridad alimentaria, tanta actualmente como a largo plazo.</descri>

  <title>Community forestry in Nepal</title>
  <subtit>A policy innovation for local livelihoods</subtit>
  <descri>The Community Forestry Program in Nepal is a global innovation in participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies, institutions, and practices. The program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction. As more than 70 percent of Nepal's population depends on agriculture for their livelihood, community management of forests has been a critically important intervention. Through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades, the program has evolved from a protection-oriented, conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use, enterprise development, and livelihood improvement. By April 2009, one-third of Nepal�s population was participating in the program, directly managing more than one-fourth of Nepal�s forest area. The immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources. Community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods. Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks. However, a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups. Lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning, establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.</descri>

  <subtit>Quality and rent distribution in global value chains</subtit>
  <descri>In recent years, quality standards have become crucial for developing countries’ agricultural production systems in gaining access to high-value markets abroad or at home. High-value supply chains offer opportunities for high profits, but in order to comply with the required standards, suppliers in developing countries often need extensive support from agrifood companies. We use a theoretical model to investigate under which conditions such synergies between suppliers and agrifood companies are sustainable, and how created rents are distributed, in a context of factor market imperfections and weak contract enforcement. We also derive the implications of development.</descri>

  <title>Food-security risks must be comprehensively addressed</title>
  <subtit>IFPRI 2008-2009 Annual Report Essay </subtit>
  <descri>ecent food-price and economic shocks have further jeopardized the food security of developing countries and poor people, pushing the estimated number of undernourished people over one billion. Known and unknown food-security risks appear to be on the rise. Increasing uncertainties raise critical questions about how to quickly, viably, and sustainably manage familiar risks and emerging new ones. The poor, particularly those who depend on food purchases, both in rural and urban areas, are highly vulnerable to market risks such as high and volatile agricultural prices, which peaked in 2007–08 (Figure 1). In many low-income countries, the food crisis is far from over as prices remain stubbornly high and income and employment opportunities are reduced. In response to the high food prices, which are not matched by equivalent increases in income, poor households are forced to consume less food and to shift to even less-balanced diets. Households also spend less on other goods and services, such as clean water, sanitation, education, and healthcare, which are essential for their short- and long-run welfare. Within households, women tend to be disproportionately hurt.1</descri>

  <title>Supply of pigeonpea genetic resources in local markets of Eastern Kenya</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"Smallholder producers in marginal and semiarid areas of eastern Kenya have not benefited greatly from research investments made in improvement of crops grown in such environments (sorghum, millet, and legumes, including pigeonpea) either by the international community or the national agricultural research system because of poorly developed seed systems. However, informal and local market purchases are the major sources of seed for non-maize cereals and legumes. In the absence of any formalized seed system for dryland crops, more and more farmers rely on local markets to supply seed during normal and disaster periods. We determined the factors affecting the quantities of pigeonpea traded by vendors during the 2006 short-rains season using simple OLS estimation. We found that the participation of traders and farmers was higher and traded larger quantities of pigeonpea in weekly markets located in areas where seed-based intervention programs in place than in non-intervention areas. Also agro-ecologically, markets located in slightly wetter regions offered more varieties and handled higher sales compared with marketsheds in dry regions. Among the traders, the grain traders dominated through their sheer volume of sales, higher investment, and storage capacity in these markets though the distinction between seeds and grains was poor. Of the vendor characteristics, young, educated vendors traded higher quantities of pigeonpea during the planting season. The amount of time spent selling by different vendors in the village fairs also had a significant influence on the pigeonpea quantity traded. Certain market infrastructure variables such as distance to the local markets and the access to information sources (mobile phones) also significantly influenced the amount of pigeonpea sold among vendors in these markets. The existing pigeonpea value chain in local markets could be improved further, provided proper synergies exist between different actors in the system. This would enhance local crop diversity levels as well as improve access to quality plant materials for farming communities in the marginal environments of eastern Kenya." --from authors' abstract</descri>

  <title>Linkages between land management, land degradation, and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
  <subtit>The case of Uganda</subtit>
  <descri>Agriculture is vital to the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa: two-thirds of the region’s people depend on it for their livelihoods. Nevertheless, agricultural productivity in most of the region is stagnant or declining, in large part because of land degradation. Soil erosion and soil nutrient depletion degraded almost 70 percent of the region’s land between 1945 and 1990; 20 percent of total agricultural land has been severely degraded. If left unchecked, land degradation could seriously threaten the progress of economic growth and poverty reduction in Africa. Within this context, most African countries strive to achieve poverty reduction and sustainable land management. In designing policies to achieve these objectives concurrently, a clear understanding of their linkage is crucial. Nonetheless, the relationships between poverty and land management are complex, context specific, and resource specific, and empirical evidence to demonstrate their linkage has been limited. This analysis seeks to improve the understanding of this linkage by examining how poverty (broadly defined to include limited access to capital, infrastructure, and services) influences land-management practices, land degradation, crop productivity, and household incomes. In particular, the study focuses on how factors susceptible to policy initiatives—such as education, agricultural technical assistance, and credit— affect households’ land management decisions. Uganda was chosen to serve as a case study of these issues, for several reasons. Of all Sub-Saharan African nations, Uganda has some of the most severe soil nutrient depletion in Africa: about 1.2 percent of nutrient stock stored in the topsoil is depleted by farmers each year. Also, the country contains a wide variety of agroecological zones (AEZs), making it an appropriate microcosm of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Ugandan government has also been conducting ambitious poverty-reduction and conservation efforts, and a study such as this one serves to measure those efforts. Working with the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), the authors drew on Uganda’s 2002–03 National Household Survey, as well as a specific survey conducted to collect poverty, land management, and land-degradation data at the household and plot levels.--From Text</descri>

  <title>Policy implications of high food prices for Africa</title>
  <subtit>IFPRI 2007-2008 Annual Report Essay</subtit>
  <descri>"African agriculture is at a crossroads. The current high food prices and the instability they have provoked in several countries have added impetus for African countries to review their agricultural policies and programs. New agricultural policies will have to be more focused on staple food crops and on their main producers-smallholders, most of whom are women. The new policies must remove constraints that impede access by smallholder farmers to the knowledge, technology, and financial services they need to increase farm productivity in a profitable and environmentally sustainable manner. Institutional mechanisms that lower the risks of lending to the agriculture sector and to smallholders in particular should be established and programs developed to leverage financial resources from the commercial banking sector. Governments and the private sector have an opportunity to work together to support the procurement, blending, and packaging of fertilizers. Together they can also support the breeding and multiplication of improved seeds. Government policies should support agro-dealers to ensure that improved seeds and other inputs are available to farmers. The many issues that African countries must address will be beyond the capacity of most countries, even after financial resources in private banks are leveraged. External assistance will be very much needed, especially to develop essential road infrastructure, irrigation, and rural energy. Other issues, including land policy, will also need attention. The road ahead for African agricultural development, especially the attainment of food security, will not be easy. African governments will need to formulate and implement bold pro-poor, pro-smallholder farmer policies that will increase farm productivity, trigger a sustainable green revolution, and end the cycle of food crises in Africa." -- from Text</descri>

  <title>Fluctuating fortunes of a collective entreprise</title>
  <subtit>The case of the Agroforestry Tree Seeds Association of Lantapan (ATSAL) in the Philippines</subtit>
  <descri>The Agroforestry Tree Seeds Association of Lantapan (ATSAL) in Bukidnon province, southern Philippines was organized in 1998, facilitated by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). Farmers were trained on germplasm collection, processing and marketing of agroforestry tree seeds and seedlings. ATSAL has been marketing various tree seeds and seedlings with apparent success, and has provided training on seed collection and nursery management to farmers, government technicians, and workers from non-government organizations (NGOs). This paper reports on the initial results of an on-going study to assess the effectiveness of ATSAL's marketing strategy, including group dynamics, and the issues and challenges the group faces. It was found that during the first two years, ATSAL's market share of greatly demanded timber tree species increased significantly, thus helping to disseminate widely these important species among farmers. ICRAF's technical back-up was an advantage, increasing the Association's market credibility. Subsequently, ATSAL extended its market to the central Philippines, but failed to meet the demand for seeds due to organizational limitations. Market competition exists, where a nonmember was able to take a larger market share than was the group. Nonetheless, ATSAL has established its name as a viable community-based seed and seedling producer, maintaining a stronghold in local and regional markets. Collective action is important for smallholders to break in, and gain market access, but is unlikely to sustain without effective leadership and some facilitation (in some cases even ongoing), thus requiring expenditures on repairs and maintenance through continuous technical and leadership training for the collective, and technical back-up and facilitation by an intermediary. Finally, facilitating smallholder collective action is essentially an arduous task, requiring the supporting agency to hold a firm grasp of market realities, to invest in the maintenance of collective action, to provide continuous technical back-up, and to ascertain the conditions that make collective action succeed.</descri>

  <title>Linkages between land management, land degradation, and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
  <subtit>The case of Uganda</subtit>
  <descri>Agriculture is vital to the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa: two-thirds of the region’s people depend on it for their livelihoods. Nevertheless, agricultural productivity in most of the region is stagnant or declining, in large part because of land degradation. Soil erosion and soil nutrient depletion degraded almost 70 percent of the region’s land between 1945 and 1990; 20 percent of total agricultural land has been severely degraded. If left unchecked, land degradation could seriously threaten the progress of economic growth and poverty reduction in Africa. Within this context, most African countries strive to achieve poverty reduction and sustainable land management. In designing policies to achieve these objectives concurrently, a clear understanding of their linkage is crucial. Nonetheless, the relationships between poverty and land management are complex, context specific, and resource specific, and empirical evidence to demonstrate their linkage has been limited. This analysis seeks to improve the understanding of this linkage by examining how poverty (broadly defined to include limited access to capital, infrastructure, and services) influences land-management practices, land degradation, crop productivity, and household incomes. In particular, the study focuses on how factors susceptible to policy initiatives—such as education, agricultural technical assistance, and credit— affect households’ land management decisions. Uganda was chosen to serve as a case study of these issues, for several reasons. Of all Sub-Saharan African nations, Uganda has some of the most severe soil nutrient depletion in Africa: about 1.2 percent of nutrient stock stored in the topsoil is depleted by farmers each year. Also, the country contains a wide variety of agroecological zones (AEZs), making it an appropriate microcosm of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Ugandan government has also been conducting ambitious poverty-reduction and conservation efforts, and a study such as this one serves to measure those efforts. Working with the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), the authors drew on Uganda’s 2002–03 National Household Survey, as well as a specific survey conducted to collect poverty, land management, and land-degradation data at the household and plot levels.--From Text</descri>

  <title>Impacts of inventory credit, input supply shops, and fertilizer microdosing in the drylands of Niger</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study investigated the impacts of access to inventory credit, input supply shops, fertilizer microdosing demonstrations, and other factors on farmers’ use of inorganic fertilizer and other inputs in Niger and on crop yields. We found that access to inventory credit and input supply shops has increased the use of inorganic fertilizer and seeds and that microdosing demonstrations have increased the use of inorganic fertilizer. Ownership of traction animals and access to off-farm employment have also contributed to the use of inorganic fertilizer, while larger farms use less fertilizer and labor per hectare. The impacts of these interventions and technologies depend on the crop mix. Inorganic fertilizer has a positive impact on millet and millet–cowpea yields when applied using microdosing, with an estimated marginal value-cost ratio greater than 3 for those crops indicating significant profitability. By contrast, microdosing has a negative impact on yields of the millet–sorghum–cowpea intercrop, suggesting that microdosing should not be promoted when sorghum is part of the crop mix. However, better access to input supply shops has contributed to higher yields of the millet–sorghum–cowpea intercrop. The predicted effect of inventory credit on farmers’ income as a result of increased inorganic fertilizer use is an increase of 5,000 to 10,000 FCFA per hectare (about US$10 to US$20 per hectare in 2005) in millet or millet–cowpea production. Similarly, being 10 km closer to an input supply shop is predicted to increase farmers’ income by 3,200 to 4,500 FCFA per hectare. These benefits do not take into account the impacts of the interventions on seeds or other inputs, which are also generally positive. The positive impacts are linked to the use of fertilizer microdosing, which has increased the productivity of fertilizer use in millet and millet–cowpea production, indicating synergies among the various interventions. They are also linked to these specific crops, because we found less favorable impacts of these interventions for the millet–sorghum–cowpea intercrop and for peanuts. Other interventions that could help to boost the use of inputs and productivity include promotion of improved access to farm equipment and traction animals and promotion of higher-value crops such as hibiscus. Further research on these topics appears warranted. Research on the implications of interventions on land degradation would also be useful.-- Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Los Biocombustibles y la Seguridad Alimentaria</title>
  <subtit>Cómo balancear la necesidad de alimento humano, alimento animal y de combustible</subtit>
  <descri>La demanda de biocombustibles se está incrementando debido a la necesidad cada vez mayor de energéticos, el alza en el costo del petróleo, la búsqueda de fuentes de energía renovables y no contaminantes y el deseo de aumentar los ingresos agrícolas en los países en desarrollo. Asimismo, ha aumentado en forma drástica la necesidad de contar con cultivos, como el maíz y la caña de azúcar, que pueden utilizarse como materia prima para producir biocombustibles. Esta demanda ha tenido a nivel mundial un impacto significativo y cada vez mayor en los sistemas alimentarios. Los efectos de la creciente demanda de biocombustibles están entremezclados con los restringidos mercados de granos, reflejo de los cambios demográficos y de una mejor alimentación. En los países en desarrollo, a medida que la población y los ingresos se incrementan, las preferencias en materia de alimentos van cambiando de cultivos básicos a productos de mayor valor, como los cárnicos y los lácteos. Como resultado, la demanda de alimento para animales a base de granos y proteínas está subiendo desmesuradamente y compitiendo con la demanda de alimentos para consumo humano.</descri>

  <title>Contract farming of swine in Southeast Asia as a response to changing market demand for quality and safety in pork</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"Contract farming is conventionally thought of as a form of industrial organization that helps to overcome high monitoring, supervision, and environmental mitigation costs incurred from ensuring a reliable and uniform-quality supply (from the standpoint of integrators) and high capital and small-scale input and service purchase costs (from the standpoint of individual farmers). But contract farming is also a private sector vertical coordination response to the changing demand for certifying the use of quality inputs to produce quality outputs and of safe production procedures. This paper draws on lessons learned from experiences in the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam to illustrate how contract farming accomplishes that goal." -- from Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Biofuels and food security</title>
  <subtit>Balancing needs for food, feed, and fuel</subtit>
  <descri>Biofuel demand is increasing because of a combination of growing energy needs; rising oil costs; the pursuit of clean, renewable sources of energy; and the desire to boost farm incomes in developed countries. In turn, the need for crops-such as maize and sugarcane-to be used as feedstocks for biofuels has increased dramatically. That demand has had a significant and increasing impact on global food systems. The effects of growing biofuel demand are interwoven with tightening grain markets, which reflect demographic shifts and improved diets. In developing countries, as populations grow and incomes rise, diet preferences are shifting from staple crops to higher-value products like meat and dairy. As a result, the demand for grain- and protein-based animal feed is soaring and competing with food needs. These changes have led to increasing pressures on global agricultural markets and higher food costs. Poor people in both rural and urban areas are disproportionately vulnerable to these forces because they spend a large share of their incomes on food. Biofuels subsidies in developed countries tend to drive up food prices, thus reducing consumption and nutritional well-being for net buyers. The higher prices for commodities resulting from biofuel feedstock production can mean higher incomes for some farmers in developing countries and better agricultural wages for laborers, although the question of distribution among winners and losers remains. Another outcome for developing countries could be increased pressure on fragile natural resources on which poor farmers depend, potentially further degrading land and stressing limited water supplies. Over the coming decades, global food and agricultural systems not only will continue to come under the strain of providing for the competing needs of food, feed, and fuel, but will also face greater pressure from climatic and other economic changes. Urgent research is needed now to address these trends and protect the livelihoods of poor people. IFPRI uses innovative quantitative and analytical techniques to help policymakers and international institutions assess the potential benefits and risks of biofuels and explore ways to provide income-generating opportunities for the world's farmers while minimizing resource degradation and food insecurity. Critical questions include how global food systems can meet growing food, feed, and fuel needs while contributing to the reduction of poverty and hunger.</descri>

  <descri>High food prices are not only causing a humanitarian crisis, but also putting at risk the development potential of millions of people. Global agriculture markets are undergoing structural changes, and the next three to four years will pose great challenges for achieving an affordable and accessible food supply for the world's most vulnerable. Soaring food and fuel prices are creating a "perfect storm" for the world's most vulnerable. The consequence is that the bottom billion could become the bottom 2 billion overnight, as those living on US$1 a day see their purchasing power cut in half.</descri>

  <title>Responding to the world food crisis-- Getting on the Right Track</title>
  <subtit>IFPRI 2007-2008 Annual Report Essay</subtit>
  <descri>"Part of the difficulty in responding to the food crisis is the lack of credible and up-todate data on the impacts of food prices on poor people and on the effects of policy responses. Such information would allow international and national decision makers to use feedback to adjust their responses and achieve maximum effectiveness. Much more investment and sound coordination is needed in this area. So far, national and international responses to the food crisis are mixed in terms of their likely effectiveness. Important steps have been taken with regard to emergency humanitarian assistance and, in some countries, social protection, but more is needed. Some countries and institutions are launching substantial investments in agricultural production, but, again, meeting global demand for food will require even greater investments. And, in the areas of trade and biofuel policies, many of the actions taken are counterproductive and actually put more upward pressure on food prices. It is promising that the issue of global food security is now on the agenda of the Group of Eight countries, but disappointing that at their July 2008 meeting they did not do more to promote social protection, revise biofuel policies, make specific commitments for funds to overcome the food crisis, or delineate the actors and mechanisms that would play roles in strengthening the global governance architecture for food and agriculture. It is crucial that the funds already committed by the G8 countries be released in a timely manner. What will it take to get food crisis responses on the right track? First of all, leadership is needed to coordinate implementation of appropriate responses. This effort could be led by the UN, as a follow up to the Group of Eight + Five countries' activities, and by major groups of developing-country players. At the moment, high and unstable food prices look like they are here to stay for some time-perhaps years. But because no one actually knows what the future holds, it is important that responses to this crisis help build the kind of food and agriculture system that can cope with a variety of possible outcomes, ranging from even higher food and energy prices to a possible short-term glut of low-priced food emerging from the current high-price environment and a world in which demand collapses due to recession. Millions of poor people would benefit from a system that would allow policymakers and others to respond calmly and rationally to eventualities like these instead of lurching from crisis to crisis. Building such a system will require collective action on an international scale. Given the strong links that tie so many countries to each other and to the world market, each country's actions inevitably have implications for others, so areas of common interest must be identified and trade-offs made. Moreover, these changes need to be made now, for the benefit of all people today and in the future." -- from Text</descri>

  <title>Forest incomes after Uganda's forest sector reform</title>
  <subtit>Are the rural poor gaining?</subtit>
  <descri>Forest sector governance reform is frequently promoted as a policy tool for achieving favorable livelihood outcomes in the low income tropics. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support this claim, particularly at the household level. Drawing on the case of a major forest sector governance reform implemented in Uganda in 2003, this study seeks to fill that gap. The research employs a quasi-experimental research design utilizing pre and post reform income portfolio data for a large sample of households surrounding three major forests in western Uganda; a control group is included in the design. On private forest land overseen by the decentralized District Forestry Service there has been no significant change in average annual household income from forests, and the share of total income from forests has only slightly increased. For households living adjacent to Budongo Central Forest Reserve, overseen by the parastatal National Forestry Authority, there have been significant gains in average annual household income from forests, as well as the share of total income from forests. However, increases are limited to households in the highest income quartile and are primarily attributed to the sale of illegally harvested timber. The findings from this study challenge the view that governance reforms result in favorable livelihood outcomes for the poorest. Policy makers should carefully consider the incentives facing both forestry officials and local resource users with particular attention to increasing awareness of the value of trees and forests, and facilitating legal opportunities for rural smallholders across all income categories to sustainably engage in forest product harvesting and value addition.</descri>

  <title>On-site and off-Site long-term economic impacts of soil fertility management practices</title>
  <subtit>The case of maize-based cropping systems in Kenya</subtit>
  <descri>"This article analyzes the on-site and off-site economic impacts of various sustainable land management (SLM) practices in Kenya. Long-term trial data are used to establish the relationship between SLM practices and maize yield. The analysis of on-site effects focuses on the profitability of maize production at the farm level, while the examined off-site effects include carbon sequestration and siltation from maize farms, which increase the cost of potable water production. The major contribution of this study is the use of long-term experimental data to estimate the impacts of land management practices on crop yield and consider their off-site benefits and costs. The results of this study show that soil and water conservation (SWC) structures reinforced with leguminous plants are more profitable when the plants are used as fodder, as opposed to situations in which only SWC structures are used. SWC structures reinforced with vegetation had lower maintenance costs, whereas those that were not reinforced with leguminous trees were not profitable over the long-term period. These results suggest that complementary and multipurpose SWC practices are more likely to be adopted compared to non-complementary and/or single-purpose practices. Thus, SWC practices should be promoted as a package of complementary technologies. If it is not feasible to promote a mix of complementary enterprises, high value crops are likely to make SLM practices more profitable. In areas where SLM practices are not profitable, promotion of alternative livelihoods is necessary. Adoption of SLM also provides global environmental services worth 10% of the net present value of the SLM practices over the 50-year period addressed in the present study Finally, the results of this analysis suggest that farmers who offer significant environmental services should be compensated for their efforts." -- from Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Improving farm-to-market linkages through contract farming</title>
  <subtit>A case study of smallholder dairying in India</subtit>
  <descri>Contract farming is emerging as an important form of vertical coordination in the agrifood supply chain in India, and its socioeconomic consequences are attracting considerable attention in public policy debates. This study is an empirical assessment of the costs and benefits of contract farming in milk using information generated through field surveys in the western state of Rajasthan. Contract farming is found to be more profitable than independent production. Its major benefits come from a reduction in marketing and transaction costs, which are otherwise much higher in the open markets. Contract farming also contributes toward improving milk yield and reducing production costs, albeit not significantly. Dairy producers also benefit from provision of services and technical advice by integrators/firms who secure milk supplies from farmers through contract. The benefits of contract farming vary by scale of operation. Economies of scale are also important determinants of competitiveness, in which large farms (both contract and independent) have lower per unit cost due to buying of inputs in bulk and greater access to markets. Smallholders, on the other hand, derive significant benefits from a reduction in marketing and transaction costs due to their participation in contract farming.--Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>Collective action to secure property rights for the poor</title>
  <subtit>A case study in Jambi Province, Indonesia</subtit>
  <descri>This study presents an approach to analyzing decentralized forestry and natural resource management and land property rights issues, and catalyzing collective action among villages and district governments. It focuses on understanding the current policies governing local people's access to property rights and decision making processes, and learning how collective action among community groups and interaction among stakeholders can enhance local people's rights over lands, resources, and policy processes for development. The authors applied participatory action research in two villages, one each in the Bungo and Tanjabbar districts of Jambi province (Sumatra), Indonesia, to facilitate identification of priorities through phases of planning, action, monitoring, and reflecting. This study finds that action research may be an effective strategy for fostering collective action and maintaining the learning process that leads groups to be more organized and cohesive, and district government officials to be more receptive to stakeholders. A higher level of collective action and support may be needed to avoid elite capture more effectively.</descri>

  <title>AIDS mortality and the role of natural resources in household food security in a rural district of South Africa</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Although wild natural resources are a standard dietary component in southern Africa, little information exists on these resources' specific role in the maintenance of household food security among HIV-impacted households. In this context, the influence of cash savings or income generated through use or sale of natural resources (e.g., using fuelwood instead of electricity to be able to afford to buy food) is also not known. Indeed, to date the environmental dimensions of the AIDS epidemic remain little explored, despite the centrality of the natural environment in the livelihoods of the rural poor across Africa. Filling this information gap is important, given that Sub-Saharan Africa is generally typified by the interlinked phenomena of rapidly rising HIV prevalence rates, high levels of food insecurity, dependence on natural resources for rural livelihoods, climatic variability, and environmental degradation. Nowhere are associations between these pheomena more urgent than in southern Africa, which has the highest rates of HIV infection in the world.</descri>

  <title>Responding to the Global Food Crisis - Three perspectives</title>
  <subtit>IFPRI 2007-2008 Annual Report Essay</subtit>
  <descri>"The dramatic rise and volatility of food prices over the last year have shaken the global food system. Governments and the international development community generally have responded to various aspects of the food crisis, but questions remain about whether the right actions are being pursued, how best to respond, and what the future holds. The three essays here by Namanga Ngongi, president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Programme, and Joachim von Braun, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, respond to these critical questions. They point to the dangers and pitfalls of misguided policies, but also to the very real opportunities for responding in a way that prevents future crises and assures food security now and in the long term." -- from Text</descri>

  <title>Impacts of the Hutan Kamasyarakatan Social Forestry Program in the Sumberjaya watershed, West Lampung District of Sumatra, Indonesia</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This paper investigates the impacts of a social forestry program in Indonesia, Hutan Kamasyarakatan (HKm), based on analysis of a survey of 640 HKm and comparable non-HKm plots in the Sumberjaya watershed of southern Sumatra, and of the households operating those plots. The HKm program provides groups of farmers with secure-tenure permits to continue farming on state Protection Forest land and in exchange for protecting remaining natural forestland, planting multistrata agroforests, and using recommended soil and water conservation (SWC) measures on their coffee plantations. Using farmers� perceptions, econometric techniques, and propensity score matching, we investigated the impacts of the HKm program on perceived land tenure security, land purchase prices, farmers' investments in tree planting and SWC measures, and plot-level profits. A significant fraction of HKm group members are not aware of the program or fully aware of its requirements. Although farmers who are aware of the program perceive its strong effects on tenure security and land values, we found insignificant impacts on the actual purchase prices of plots. Nevertheless, our survey revealed that the HKm program has contributed to increased planting of timber and multipurpose trees. We did not find significant impacts on investments in SWC measures or on soil fertility management practices. HKm has had mixed impacts on profits, with timber trees reducing profitability because timber harvesting is not allowed and multipurpose nontimber trees contributing to increased profits. The policy implications of these findings are also discussed in the paper.--Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Linking collective action to non-timber forest product market for improved local livelihoods</title>
  <subtit>Challenges and opportunities</subtit>
  <descri>The paper draws on findings from research in South Sulawesi and Jambi Provinces, Indonesia, looking at the role of collective action in helping two local community groups enhance their bargaining power vis a vis other market players (such as collectors, small- and large-scale industries) and promote an increased demand for non-timber forest products. The first group has traditionally collected rattan (Calamus sp) from surrounding forests and was struggling to sell their products at a better price amid market uncertainties and the lack of supportive government policies. The second one was involved in the propagation of another high-value rattan species, widely known as Dragon Blood (Daemonorops sp), in anticipation of an increased market demand for this product. The paper describes challenges and opportunities for the country’s forestry decentralization and marketing of forest products, and the role of collective action in improving groups’ access to government resources and markets. It also discusses the research team’s part in facilitating the groups and highlights the strengths of participatory action research approach in fostering collective action among local stakeholders.</descri>

  <title>Cost implications of agricultural land degradation in Ghana</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"An economywide, multimarket model is constructed for Ghana and the effects of agricultural soil erosion on crop yields are explicitly modeled at the subnational regional level for eight main staple crops. The model is used to evaluate the aggregate economic costs of soil erosion by taking into account economywide linkages between production and consumption, across sectors and agricultural subsectors. To fill a gap in the literature regarding economic cost analysis of soil erosion, this paper also analyzes the poverty implications of land degradation. The model predicts that land degradation reduces agricultural income in Ghana by a total of US$4.2 billion over the period 2006–2015, which is approximately five percent of total agricultural GDP in these ten years. The effect of soil loss on poverty is also significant at the national level, equivalent to a 5.4 percentage point increase in the poverty rate in 2015 compared to the case of no soil loss. Moreover, soil loss causes a slowing of poverty reduction over time in the three northern regions, which currently have the highest poverty rates in the country. Sustainable land management (SLM) is the key to reducing agricultural soil loss. The present findings indicate that through the adoption of conventional SLM practices, the declining trend in land productivity can be reversed, and that use of a combination of conventional and modern SLM practices would generate an aggregate economic benefit of US$6.4 billion over the period 2006–2015. SLM practices would therefore significantly reduce poverty in Ghana, particularly in the three northern regions." -- Authors' Abstract"</descri>

  <title>Could payments for environmental services improve rangeland management in Central Asia, West Asia and North Africa?</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Although several institutional and management approaches that address the degradation of the rangelands have been tested in the dry areas of Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA), impact has been limited. Nonetheless, the development of National Action Plans to combat desertification highlights the interest of governments to tackle this issue. Payment for Environmental Services (PES) may be a viable policy option, though, to date, most PES programs have focused on the management of different resources (forests, watersheds). The purpose of this paper is to examine whether PES could be a viable option to promote sustainable rangelands management in the dry rangelands of CWANA. Specifically, it focuses on the scientific gaps and knowledge related to the local and global environmental services produced by rangelands and addresses questions related to the beneficiaries of these services. Institutional conditions necessary for the implementation of such schemes are discussed.</descri>

  <title>Seed provision and dryland crops in the semiarid regions of Eastern Kenya</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Over the last two decades, several seed-related programs have been initiated in eastern Kenya to improve farmers’ access to quality seeds of dryland cereals and legumes. They are provided during two occasions, regular and emergency times. But very often, the formal supply mechanisms limit their role in provision of seeds other than maize. In the absence of any formalized systems of seed provision for other dryland crops, such as sorghum and pigeon pea, farmers have preferred local markets for their seed needs, especially during distress periods. Here we have examined the role of various seed-intervention programs in eastern Kenya, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each program. We have also underscored the importance of local markets and their actors in meeting the needs for non-maize and bean seeds in these marginal environments. For this purpose, detailed, informal interviews were conducted during October–December 2005 with all the stakeholders, namely public and private institutions and vendors in eight major local markets in eastern Kenya. The results of the study call for synergies between existing formal (private, public, and other development initiative) systems and informal (local market) seed systems to enhance crop yields and the diversity of dryland cereals and legumes through effective seed-supply interventions." -- from Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Impact of contract farming on income</title>
  <subtit>Linking small farmers, packers, and supermarket in China</subtit>
  <descri>Contract farming is seen by proponents as a way to raise small-farm income by delivering technology and market information to small farmers, incorporating them into remunerative new markets. Critics, however, see it as a strategy for agribusiness firms to pass production risk to farmers, taking advantage of an unequal bargaining relationship. There is also concern that contract farming will worsen rural income inequality by favoring larger farmers. This study examines these issues in Shandong Province, China, using survey data collected from 162 apple and green onion farmers and interviews with four contracting firms in 2005. Using a probit model to estimate participation in a contract-farming scheme, we find little evidence that contracting firms prefer to work with larger farmers, though all farms in the area are quite small. Furthermore, using a Heckman selection-correction model to control for possible selection bias, we find that contract farmers earn significantly more than independent farmers after controlling for household labor availability, education, farm size, and other characteristics. Finally, we find that the way contracting contributes to farm income varies between commodities: contract apple growers benefit from higher yields (presumably due to technical assistance), while contract green onion growers receive higher prices (presumably due to better quality). These results suggest that contract farming can help small farmers raise their incomes and gain access to the growing urban and export markets. Questions remain regarding the number of farmers that are, or could be, brought into similar contract arrangements." -- from Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>HIV/AIDS, land-based livelihoods, and land reform in South Africa</title>
  <subtit>Report to the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Department of Land Affairs, South Africa</subtit>
  <descri>This study is an effort to understand the relationship between HIV/AIDS and land reform in South Africa. It is conceptualised as a longitudinal study covering three years. The study is presently concluding its first year, which has focused on 10 sites in three provinces and the information herein is considered baseline data. Much of the analysis in this report pertains to the nature of land reform projects and land-based livelihoods, and infers the connection to HIV/AIDS rather than observes it directly. The ultimate aim of the research is to generate actionable policy recommendations and programme responses, first of all by answering basic questions such as to what extent and in what way the HIV/AIDS epidemic poses a threat to South Africa’s land reform programme, and secondly by identifying specific ways in which land reform policy and practice should be adjusted. The study is about the impact of HIV/AIDS on land reform and rural livelihoods, and also whether and how land reform can serve as an intervention to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on affected households. -- from Executive Summary</descri>

  <title>Access to dynamic markets for small commercial farmers</title>
  <subtit>the case of potato production in the Peruvian Andes</subtit>
  <descri>The purpose of this study is twofold. On one hand, the objective is to assess the impact of new and more complex contracting schemes, as opposed to traditional marketing channels, on small farmers’ welfare. On the other hand, the study explores which may be the critical factors that determine the small farmers’ participation in these institutional arrangements. In this context, two critical factors are stressed. The first one has to do with access to credit and the second one is the size of the agricultural plot. In order to examine the decision of farmers to access the dynamic markets, the paper follows the study of Lapar et al (2003). The paper also follows impact evaluation techniques to identify the differences in the performance of farmers with access to dynamic markets and those without access.  As it can be seen, in all cases, the difference between farmers with access and those without access is positive. This implies that having access to dynamic markets has positive impacts on the welfare of farmers. The results show that the farmers linked to the dynamic markets gain two cents of a dollar more per kilogram of potato.  ...Our simulations showed that increase of their plot size to a minimum of five hectares (optimal size according to the industry) increases their sales to dynamic markets in 16%. However, the impact of new and more complex contracting schemes, as opposed to traditional marketing channels, could reduce significantly the access gap to dynamic markets by reducing transaction costs, increasing productivity, and increasing scale production through coordination of smallholders.</descri>

  <title>Efficiency and distribution in contract farming</title>
  <subtit>the case of Indian poultry growers</subtit>
  <descri>This paper is an empirical analysis of the gains from contract farming in the case of poultry production in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India.   The paper finds that contract production is more efficient than noncontract production.  The efficiency surplus is largely appropriated by the processor.  Despite this, contract growers still gain appreciably from contracting in terms of lower risk and higher expected returns.  Improved technology and production practices as well as the way in which the processor selects growers are what make these outcomes possible.  In terms of observed and unobserved characteristics, contract growers have relatively poor prospects as independent growers. With contract production, these growers achieve incomes comparable to that of independent growers.</descri>

  <title>Gender and local floodplain management institutions</title>
  <subtit>a case study from Bangladesh</subtit>
  <descri>Floodplain wetlands are the major common pool natural resource in Bangladesh. Mostly men fish, and both men and women collect aquatic plants and snails. Case studies contrast a women-only, men-only, and mixed community based organization (CBO), each of which manages a seasonal floodplain wetland. The two CBOs in which women hold key positions are in Hindu communities where more women use aquatic resources, work for an income, and belong to other local institutions. In the oldest of these CBOs, more women have gradually become office bearers as their recognition in the community has grown. In the Muslim community, only a few women collect aquatic resources and in this community most women do not perceive floodplain natural resource constraints to be very important to them. These women have no role in the CBO and feel that they have no say in decisions about the fishery, unlike many women in the other two sites. The fishery management activities in all three sites are similar and catches and biodiversity appear to have improved, demonstrating that women can play an effective role in community organizations for fishery management. Those who are represented in the CBOs reported significant increases in their participation and influence. Men and women in all three sites recognized that decisionmaking and management of their fisheries had improved, but community support and compliance were higher where both men and women had an active role in this process. Women had a more diverse set of criteria for effective CBOs than men. The men-only CBO saw itself as more of a membership based organization than as representing all of the community. -- Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>Improving the effectiveness of collective action</title>
  <subtit>sharing experiences from community forestry in Nepal</subtit>
  <descri>"The forest management strategy of Nepal is based on people’s participation, which is known as community forestry. This approach was formally introduced in 1978 to encourage active participation of local people in forest management activities as a means to improve their livelihoods. Under the community forestry structure, local people make decisions regarding forest management, utilization and distribution of benefits from a forest; they are organized as a Community Forest User Group. Presently about 1.2 million hectares of forest is under the control of about 14,000 Community Forest User Groups. It has received highest priority within the forestry sector and is one of the most successful development initiatives in Nepal. However, emerging evidence indicates that forest user groups have excluded rather than included women’s participation in their activities. This paper is based on the findings from six forest users groups implementing a program aimed at strengthening governance at the local level through increased women’s participation and increased advocacy skills and capacity of selected civil society groups. It presents the process of women’s empowerment in forest user groups by describing changes made in those groups once women begin participating and holding key decision-making positions. The findings note significant variation in funds allocated for social and community development activities, which are necessary to address the issues of poverty and social equity in Nepal. In addition, they note the importance of building both the capacity of individual women leaders and an enabling environment to support the women’s initiatives. A collaborative and inclusive approach that includes women and marginalized groups as committee executives and members of local government bodies is necessary to build the enabling environment." -- Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>Farmer management of production risk on degraded lands</title>
  <subtit>the role of wheat genetic diversity in Tigray Region, Ethiopia</subtit>
  <descri>"This paper investigates the effects of wheat genetic diversity and land degradation on risk and agricultural productivity in less favored production environments of a developing agricultural economy. Drawing production data from household survey conducted in the highlands of Ethiopia, we estimate a stochastic production function to evaluate the effects of variety richness, land degradation, and their interaction on the mean and the variance of wheat yield. Ethiopia is a centre of diversity for durum wheat and farmers manage complex variety mixtures on multiple plots.  Econometric evidence shows that variety richness increases farm productivity. Variety richness also reduces yield variability but only for high levels of genetic diversity. Simulations with estimated parameters illustrate how planting more diverse durum wheat varieties on multiple plots contributes to improving farmer's welfare."" -- Authors' abstract</descri>

  <descri>Recent trends in agricultural growth and food security in Eastern and Central Africa (ECA) have been discouraging. With very low labor productivity, yields, and growth rates, agriculture is unable to keep up with population growth or achieve the type of pro-poor growth needed to reduce poverty dramatically.Yet agriculture accounts for about half of the region’s gross domestic product (GDP) and is the main source of livelihood for the majority of the population. Behind this gloomy picture, however, lies agriculture’s potential to be the engine for growth in ECA. What do the ECA countries need to do to effectively exploit the potential of agriculture and meet the needs of their burgeoning populations?</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Agriculture and nutrition linkages -- old lessons and new paradigms</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Agriculture is fundamental to achieving nutrition goals: it produces the food, energy, and nutrients essential for human health and well-being. Gains in food production have played a key role in feeding growing and malnourished populations. Yet they have not translated into a hunger-free world nor prevented the development of further nutritional challenges. Micronutrient deficiencies (for example, of vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc) are now recognized as being even more limiting for human growth, development, health, and productivity than energy deficits. Hunger among the poor also increasingly manifests itself through excessive consumption of energy-rich but nutrient-poor foods. The result is a double burden of undernutrition (deficiencies of energy, micronutrients, or both) and “overnutrition” (poor diet quality leading to obesity and other diet-related chronic illnesses).</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Policymaking initiatives in agriculture and public health are often pursued in a parallel and unconnected fashion. Yet coherent, joint action in agriculture and health could have large potential benefits and substantially reduce risks for the poor. Among development professionals there is growing recognition that agriculture influences health, and health influences agriculture, and that both in turn have profound implications for poverty reduction. This recognition suggests that opportunities exist for agriculture to contribute to better health, and for health to contribute to agricultural productivity. To take advantage of these opportunities, however, it is crucial to understand the precise linkages between the two sectors. How do the linkages work? Where do opportunities for joint action lie, and what are the impediments? How can the agricultural and health sectors work together more closely and thereby contribute to addressing poverty?</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Overview</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"Good health and productive agriculture are both essential in the fight against poverty. In a rapidly changing world, agriculture faces many challenges, both old (natural resource constraints, extreme weather conditions, and agricultural pests) and new (globalization, environmental degradation, problems of maintaining production in conflict situations). At the same time, new global health threats emerge, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and avian influenza, while old ones persist. Not only do malaria, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infection, and malnutrition continue to take a heavy toll, but the health sector is faced with increasing problems of chronic disease, drug and insecticide resistance, and a diminishing arsenal of effective interventions. And as the world becomes more integrated, so do the agricultural and health problems the world faces... The briefs in this series aim to communicate what is known about the linkages between agriculture and health in science and policy, thereby stimulating interest in and dialogue on agriculture and health. With a focus on the poor in developing countries, the briefs deal with the relationship between agricultural producers, systems, and outputs and the world’s leading causes of death and disease. They examine the various trade-offs involved and set out some of the approaches needed to create improved synergies between the agricultural and health sectors." -- From text</descri>

  <subtit>gender effects from participation in joint forest management</subtit>
  <descri>This paper analyzes how women’s participation affects institutional outcomes related to the decentralized governance of community forests in Madhya Pradesh, India. The analysis is based on data from a representative sample of 641 cases of joint forest management, India’s flagship program to involve communities in forest governance. We focus on two outcomes relevant for local livelihoods: control of illicit grazing and control of illicit felling in the forest. The paper statistically estimates the effects of women’s participation on outcomes, and also the source of this effect in terms of women’s representation in committees and action in protecting forests. We find that women’s participation has substantial positive effects on regulating illicit grazing and felling, even after controlling for the effects of a range of independent variables. We also find that the “action effect” is more important than the “representation effect,” confirming some major arguments advanced by feminist environmentalists. Our statistical results are robust to different specifications and provide considerable empirical support for promoting women’s participation in community-based protection of natural resources.  -- Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Agriculture, food, and health: perspectives on a long relationship</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Agriculture produces food fundamental for human health. It therefore seems obvious that agriculture, food, and health are related! Agriculture affects whether people have enough food to eat, whether it is of sufficient nutritional value, and whether it is safe, all of which affect human health. But it is not so simple: history has taught that there are different ways of looking at the relationships between agriculture, food, and health. Agricultural connections to food and health are mediated by the natural environment, human culture, and technological change. The challenge today of how to achieve equitable food production that delivers optimum nutrition for health requires an ever better understanding of the interplay between agriculture and environment, culture, and technical capacity, and how it has changed over time... there is growing recognition among all stakeholders that: current institutions do not yet adequately link policy demands across levels of governance: global, regional, national, and local; the coincidence of over-, under-, and malconsumption within societies is likely to remain and possibly grow, particularly if current global economic trends continue; nutrition will have to play a more direct part in framing farm policy and practice; agriculture will face renewed pressure to deliver, via sustainable methods, not just more food, but better-quality and health-enhancing foods; and market mechanisms need a stronger push to link health, environment, and food systems in ways that are equitable, both within and between nations, while prioritizing public health.</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Agrobiodiversity, nutrition, and health</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"With half the world’s population living in cities and towns, many poor urban dwellers face problems gaining access to adequate supplies of nutritionally balanced food. For many urban populations, an important source of food is urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA). Production and processing of crops—particularly horticultural crops—and livestock is frequently part of urban and peri-urban livelihood strategies, and the food produced forms a large part of informal sector economic activity. This brief examines the benefits and problems of UPA for the nutrition and health of poor urban and peri-urban populations... An adequate health-impact assessment of urban agriculture is still incomplete.Research questions remain concerning the level of chronic disease risk posed by contamination of urban food from air pollution, as well from industrial effluents. Further assessment is needed of the health risks of using biological wastes as fertilizer. Research questions also remain regarding the infectious disease risks posed by urban livestock keeping... Adequate waste treatment systems and sanitation need to be provided to poor countries’ urban areas, but the technologies should be designed to capture the nutrients in waste for increased food production. Control of discharges into soil, air, and water by industries, whether large factories or small kiosks, is likewise essential. Existing environmental legislation needs to be made effective by proper implementation through both community action and government support in urban neighborhoods." -- From text</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Agriculture and health in the policymaking process</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"Earlier briefs in this series make the case that there is added value for the agricultural and health sectors in working more closely together to address problems of human well-being that fall at the intersection of the two sectors. Yet the divisions between the two sectors are wide and difficult to bridge. Building the space and providing sufficient incentives and resources for collaborative activities between them will require changes in government policy—itself not a straightforward endeavor. Moreover, the sharp human and financial resource constraints in developing countries compound the challenge. This brief describes some of the important barriers to effective collaboration between the two sectors and suggests ways to overcome them. First, though, why does policy matter in this context? Policy states how government intends to prioritize the allocation of resources under its control for what is perceived to be the best interest of society. Poor health and stagnant or declining agricultural productivity are among the most fundamental challenges to improved human welfare and economic growth. Government has the responsibility for providing many of the institutions, infrastructure, and resources — key public goods — without which many farmers, in particular, will remain unhealthy, unproductive, and mired in poverty. Thus the policies and actions of government are a critical component in enabling individuals, particularly in rural areas, to live healthier and more productive lives." -- From text</descri>

  <descri>"...At the moment, a lack of integration and coordination characterizes the relationship between the agriculture and health sectors. Traditionally, agricultural and health policies address specific goals within those sectors. Agricultural policies address conservation of the natural resource base, protection of farmers’ livelihoods, basic needs of the poor including food security, and the context for regulations on, among other things, food safety and the sound use of  pesticides. National public health policies are also sectorally driven and reflect the dichotomy in the health sector between preventive action and curative care... [A] conducive policy framework is essential for effective agriculture-health collaboration. This framework should be comprehensive, focus on strategic issues, be periodically reviewed and updated, and maintain criteria that recognize the bidirectional nature of the links. Not only are these policies important at the national level, but they should also be introduced at the level of international organizations and bilateral and multilateral development agencies." -- From text</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Agriculture and nutrition linkages -- old lessons and new paradigms</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Agriculture is fundamental to achieving nutrition goals: it produces the food, energy, and nutrients essential for human health and well-being. Gains in food production have played a key role in feeding growing and malnourished populations. Yet they have not translated into a hunger-free world nor prevented the development of further nutritional challenges. Micronutrient deficiencies (for example, of vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc) are now recognized as being even more limiting for human growth, development, health, and productivity than energy deficits. Hunger among the poor also increasingly manifests itself through excessive consumption of energy-rich but nutrient-poor foods. The result is a double burden of undernutrition (deficiencies of energy, micronutrients, or both) and “overnutrition” (poor diet quality leading to obesity and other diet-related chronic illnesses).</descri>

  <title>Understanding the links between agriculture and health: Agriculture, malaria, and water-associated diseases</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Malaria, schistosomiasis (bilharzia), and Japanese encephalitis are the major vector-borne diseases whose increase or decrease can be attributed to agricultural water development (see table). Others include dengue fever, yellow fever, and filariasis. Young children in poor communities are particularly affected: malaria is among the top five causes of death among under-fives in Sub-Saharan Africa; schistosomiasis among children affects growth, nutritional status, and cognitive development; and encephalitis occurs mainly in young children... Water development projects bring important benefits locally and globally. Yet it is often assumed that irrigation will bring health benefits to all, regardless of their socioeconomic standing within a community. In reality, the economic and social impacts of irrigation are diverse and widespread, and neither costs nor benefits are evenly distributed among community members. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as elsewhere in the world, there is increasing recognition of the need to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural development on ecosystems and peoples’ health. Unless well-targeted interventions are made, the most vulnerable—notably poor children and their mothers—will continue to benefit least from the promise of irrigation and suffer most from the adverse health impacts." -- From text</descri>

  <descri>"Agriculture is the main source of livelihood of the majority of people affected by HIV and AIDS globally, and it is being progressively undermined by the disease. In Sub-Saharan Africa AIDS is affecting the rural landscape in ways that demand a rethinking of development policy and practice, and parts of South Asia may soon face a similar situation.... There is clearly tremendous scope for agricultural policy to become more HIV-responsive, both to further AIDS-related objectives and to help achieve agricultural objectives. Yet there are no magic bullets. Land-labor ratios and the relative degree of substitutability between household resources, among other factors, will determine the possible responses to HIV/AIDS. If policy becomes more HIV- responsive, it will stay relevant and effective. By mainstreaming HIV/AIDS into the policy process and carefully monitoring the results, policymakers will help build up evidence of what works in different contexts, enhance learning, and ultimately leave people better equipped to address the multiple threats of the pandemic." -- From text</descri>

  <descri>"Research, invention, and adoption of agrotechnology have played an important role in improving human nutrition and health. Agrotechnology has introduced more effective plant breeds (such as high-yielding varieties), enhanced land management techniques (such as terracing), and improved water management tools (such as irrigation). The adoption of these techniques has benefited nutrition, largely through boosting crop productivity, thereby providing employment and income to rural populations and increasing local and global food supplies... for the health needs of small farmers and laborers—as well as poor consumers—to influence research decisions, governments need to develop (1) institutions and incentives to promote such people’s participation and communication with the formal research community; (2) competition among private research providers; and (3) public research in activities that respond to farmers’ needs but are unlikely to attract formal private research." -- From text</descri>

  <title>Policy options for increasing crop productivity and reducing soil nutrient depletion and poverty in Uganda</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study was conducted with the main objective of determining the linkages between poverty and land management practices in Uganda. The study used the 2002/03 Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) and more focused data collected from a sub-sample of 851 households of the 2002/03 UNHS sample households. We found that farmers in Uganda deplete about 1.2 percent of the nutrient stock stored in the topsoil per year, which leads to a predicted 0.31 percent reduction in crop productivity.  The value of replacing the depleted nutrients using the cheapest inorganic fertilizers is equivalent to about 20 percent of household income obtained from agricultural production. Econometric analysis of the survey results provides evidence of linkages between poverty and land management practices. Land investments increase agricultural productivity and income and conserve natural resources. Many inputs and land management practices increase crop production per acre. We observed an inverse farm size – crop productivity relationship but a negative association of farm size and per capita income. Education of female household members has generally a limited impact on land management, while male education is associated with greater use of inorganic fertilizer.  Both female post-secondary and male primary and secondary education are associated with higher crop productivity. Larger families use more erosive practices but realize higher value of crop production per acre but have lower per capita income. Access to financial capital, markets and roads has limited effect on land management. However, access to financial capital and non-farm opportunities increase crop productivity and per capita household income and access to roads contributes to higher per capita household income and less soil nutrient depletion. These results support the Uganda government poverty reduction strategy through building rural roads, and increasing access to financial capital and non-farm opportunities. Both the traditional and the new agricultural extension program increase use of fertilizer and crop productivity, suggesting that investment in extension services could significantly contribute to agricultural modernization and poverty reduction. The results suggest the need to give incentives for technical assistance programs to operate in remote areas, where access to extension services is limited. Perennial crop producers deplete soil nutrients more rapidly, implying the need to promote measures to restore soil nutrients in perennial (especially banana) production areas. We find no significant differences in crop productivity or income per capita associated with differences in land tenure systems. Our findings suggest that customary land tenure, which is the most common form of tenure, is not a constraint to improvements in land productivity or use of sustainable land management. Overall, our results provide general support for the hypothesis that promotion of poverty reduction and agricultural modernization through technical assistance programs and investments in infrastructure and education can improve agricultural productivity and help reduce poverty.  However, they also show that some of these investments do not necessarily reduce land degradation, and may contribute to worsening land degradation in the near term.  Thus, investing in poverty reduction and agricultural modernization is not sufficient to address the problem of land degradation in Uganda, and must be complemented by greater efforts to address this problem."""" -- Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <subtit>Determinants of enactment, awareness and compliance with community natural resource management</subtit>
  <descri>Community-based Natural Resource Management (NRM) is increasingly becoming an important approach for addressing natural resource degradation in low income countries. This study analyzes the determinants of enactment, awareness of and compliance with by-laws related to Natural Resource Management (NRM) in order to draw policy implications that could be used to increase the effectiveness of by-laws in managing natural resources sustainably.  We found a strong association between awareness and compliance with NRM bylaws. This suggests the need to promote environmental education as part of the strategy to increase compliance with NRM bylaws. Econometric analysis of the survey data indicates factors that are associated with enactment of local NRM bylaws, and awareness of and compliance with NRM requirements... These findings imply that improving awareness of NRM requirements is critical to increase compliance with such requirements. Awareness is greater in areas closer to all-weather roads, probably due to better access to information in such areas. Development of roads and communication can thus facilitate better community NRM. Other low cost options to increase awareness could include use of radio programs, environmental education in schools, resource user seminars, brochures, and district level training workshops...Several dimensions of poverty, including greater income poverty, poor education, and poor access to credit are associated with lower compliance with tree planting and protection requirements. This supports the hypothesis of a poverty-natural resource degradation trap, and suggests that measures to reduce poverty can have “win-win” benefits helping to improve NRM as well" -- from Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Collective action and property rights in fisheries management</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Fisheries are complex and interdependent ecological and social systems that require integrated management approaches. The actions of one person or group of users affect the availability of the resource for others. Managing such common pool resources requires conscious efforts by a broad range of stakeholders to organize and craft rules enabling equitable and sustainable use of the resources for everyone?s benefit. Collective action is often a prerequisite for the development of community-based institutions and the devolution of authority...  in the 1990s the WorldFish Center conducted an issuebased, multisectoral, and multidisciplinary analysis (including ecological, economic, social, political, and administrative perspectives) that led to the production of a coastal environmental profile, a technical report detailing the status of fisheries, and an integrated fisheries management plan.... San Miguel?s experience highlights (1) the critical role of an appropriate human perception of the situation; (2) the importance of collective action and stakeholder participation at key stages of research, planning, and implementation; (3) the usefulness of structured decision methods for research, planning, and associated debates; and (4) the efficacy of research combined with planning efforts to ensure its utilization and relevance on the one hand and to provide a scientific basis for management planning on the other. --- from Text.</descri>

  <descri>In this brief, we explore the role that social institutions -specifically  property rights and collective action - may play in the development of agroforestry.... In the future, property rights and collective action will play increasingly pivotal roles in defining rights and responsibilities over the externalities of tree management practices. As stakeholders recognize the need for effective management of, for example, the erosion resulting from tree felling or rights to carbon sequestration from tree planting, they will increasingly value and depend on the institutions that protect their property rights. -- from Text.</descri>

  <title>Collective action and property rights for sustainable development</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Institutions of collective action and systems of property rights shape how people use natural resources, and these patterns of use in turn affect the outcomes of people’s agricultural production systems. Together, mechanisms of collective action and property rights define the incentives people face for undertaking sustainable and productive management strategies, and they affect the level and distribution of benefits from natural resources. The linkages between property rights, collective action, and natural resource management have important implications for technology adoption, economic growth, food security, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. Yet despite their importance in people’s lives, property rights and collective action are often undervalued, and when they are recognized, often misunderstood.</descri>

  <descri>Las instituciones de acción colectiva y los sistemas de derechos de propiedad moldean la forma en que la gente usa los recursos naturales.A su vez, estos patrones de uso afectan los resultados de los sistemas de producción agrícola de la gente. Juntos, los mecanismos de acción colectiva y los sistemas de derechos de propiedad definen los incentivos a los que la gente accede por llevar a cabo estrategias de gestión sostenible y productiva, y afectan el nivel y distribución de los beneficios de los recursos naturales. Los vínculos entre los derechos de propiedad, la acción colectiva y la gestión de los recursos naturales tienen repercusiones importantes para la adopción de tecnología, el crecimiento económico, la seguridad alimentaria, la reducción de la pobreza y la sostenibilidad ambiental. No empero, a pesar de su importancia en la vida de la gente, muy a menudo los derechos de propiedad y la acción colectiva se infravaloran y cuando se reconocen, no se interpretan correctamente.</descri>

  <title>The emergence and spreading of an improved traditional soil and water conservation practice in Burkina Faso</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>"This paper describes the emergence of improved traditional planting pits (zaï) in Burkina Faso in the early 1980s as well as their advantages, disadvantages and impact. The zaï emerged in a context of recurrent droughts and frequent harvest failures, which triggered farmers to start improving this local practice. Despair triggered experimentation and innovation by farmers. These processes were supported and complemented by external intervention. Between 1985 and 2000 substantial public investment has taken place in soil and water conservation (SWC). The socio-economic and environmental situation on the northern part of the Central Plateau is still precarious for many farming families, but the predicted environmental collapse has not occurred and in many villages indications can be found of both environmental recovery and poverty reduction." -- Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>Building on successes in African agriculture</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Agricultural growth will prove essential for improving the welfare of the vast majority of Africa’s poor. Roughly 80 percent of the continent’s poor live in rural areas, and even those who do not will depend heavily on increasing agricultural productivity to lift them out of poverty. Seventy percent of all Africans— and nearly 90 percent of the poor—work primarily in agriculture. As consumers, all of Africa’s poor—both urban and rural—count heavily on the efficiency of the continent’s farmers. </descri>

  <title>Perspectiva general [in Acción colectiva y derechos de propiedad para el desarrollo sostenible]</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Las instituciones de acción colectiva y los sistemas de derechos de propiedad moldean la forma en que la gente usa los recursos naturales.A su vez, estos patrones de uso afectan los resultados de los sistemas de producción agrícola de la gente. Juntos, los mecanismos de acción colectiva y los sistemas de derechos de propiedad definen los incentivos a los que la gente accede por llevar a cabo estrategias de gestión sostenible y productiva, y afectan el nivel y distribución de los beneficios de los recursos naturales. Los vínculos entre los derechos de propiedad, la acción colectiva y la gestión de los recursos naturales tienen repercusiones importantes para la adopción de tecnología, el crecimiento económico, la seguridad alimentaria, la reducción de la pobreza y la sostenibilidad ambiental. No empero, a pesar de su importancia en la vida de la gente, muy a menudo los derechos de propiedad y la acción colectiva se infravaloran y cuando se reconocen, no se interpretan correctamente.</descri>

  <title>Improved fallows in Kenya</title>
  <subtit>history, farmer practice, and impacts</subtit>
  <descri>This case study explores the development, dissemination, adoption, and impact of improved tree fallows in rural western Kenya. The processes of technology development and dissemination throughout the region are described and analyzed. To analyze adoption and impact, the paper applies a variety of different data collection methods as well as samples from both pilot areas where researchers maintained a significant presence and non-pilot areas where farmers learned of the technologies through other channels. Sample sizes for the quantitative analysis ranged from almost 2,000 households for measuring the adoption process to just over 100 households for measuring impact indicators. Qualitative methods included long-term case studies for 40 households and focus group discussions involving 16 different groups. The paper describes the ways in which farmers used and modified improved fallow practices. Discussion also examines the types of households using fallows and benefiting from their use.</descri>

  <title>Understanding collective action</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The author tells us that Collective action occurs when more than one individual is required to contribute to an effort in order to achieve an outcome. People living in rural areas and using natural resources engage in collective action on a daily basis when they  plant or harvest food together;  use a common facility for marketing their products;  maintain a local irrigation system or patrol a local forest to see that users are following rules; and  meet to decide on rules related to all of the above. Frequently, however, it becomes difficult to exclude nonparticipants from benefiting from the collective action of others. This situation creates a collective action problem for the participants. When individuals seek out short-term benefits for themselves alone, they are better off when others contribute to the collective action and they do not. In this case, they benefit without paying the costs. Of course, if all individuals pursue short-term, self-centered benefits, no collective benefits are achieved. She then discusses  how participants can overcome the collective action problems they face and the resource system attributes and the participant attributes that aid in overcoming these problems. -- from Text.</descri>

  <descri>The government of Uganda, with help from its development partners, is designing and implementing policies and strategies to address poverty, land degradation, and declining agricultural productivity. Land degradation, especially soil erosion and depletion of soil nutrients, is widespread in Uganda and contributes to declining productivity, which in turn increases poverty. The report has four major objectives: (1) to examine the causes of land degradation in Uganda; (2) to identify the determinants of income strategies and land management decisions and their impacts on agricultural productivity, soil erosion, and household income; (3) to assess the trade-offs and complementarities among these different objectives; and (4) to analyze the soil nutrient depletion in eastern Uganda to determine the factors that influence it." -- from Text</descri>

  <title>Linkages between poverty and land management in rural Uganda</title>
  <subtit>evidence from the Uganda National Household Survey, 1999/00</subtit>
  <descri>This study investigates the impacts of rural poverty on farmers’ land management decisions, crop production and incomes, based upon analysis of data from the 1999/2000 Uganda National Household Survey.  We find that the impacts of rural poverty on land management, crop production and income depend upon the type of poverty (i.e., what asset or access factor is constrained) and the type of land management considered...Our results suggest that improvement in smallholders’ access to land, other assets, education, extension, market information, credit, roads, and off-farm opportunities can help to break the downward cycle of poverty and land degradation, and put farmers on a more sustainable development pathway.  Access to land (area and quality), other assets, education and off-farm opportunities appear to be particularly important in addressing poverty directly, while other interventions are likely to have more indirect impacts, as they influence land management, crop choice, and other livelihood decisions.  Given the importance of land as the major asset owned by poor rural households in Uganda, investing in land quality maintenance and improvement is a critical need.  However, we found low marginal returns to investments in organic or inorganic fertilizer and other land management practices, suggesting that it will be difficult to get farmers to make such investments in the present environment.  Improvements in the market environment as well as development of more profitable land management technologies appears essential to address this need."--from Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>Strategies for sustainable natural resource management</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This brief describes two case studies as follows: "Sub-Saharan Africa, with the highest fertility rate in the world, faces increasing demographic pressure on its natural resource base.... Old strategies for coping with these new pressures on the natural resource base are becoming increasingly infeasible... Consequently, Africa's farmers require new solutions to address the increasing pressure on the continent's soil and water resources. Among hundreds of innovative efforts across the continent, two promising sets of responses have emerged in different locations.... First is the use of planting basins, an approach that has emerged in recent decades in both the Sahel and Zambia.... The second strategy involves the use of improved fallows, introduced over the past decade in eastern Zambia and western Kenya." [from Text]. The authors look at the impact and the drivers of change and conclude with key lessons learned for buidling future successes.</descri>

  <title>Gestión colaborativa de los bosques</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>En el mundo entero, los gobiernos buscan cada vez más gestionar sus bosques con la colaboración de la gente que vive cerca de ellos. Por lo general, los ministerios forestales o sus equivalentes lo hacen ofreciendo a la población local acceso a productos forestales seleccionados o a tierras de bosques, ingresos provenientes de los recursos forestales u oportunidades de comunicarse con las autoridades forestales gubernamentales. A cambio de ello, el organismo insta a la población local a colaborar en la gestión de los bosques cercanos a ellos, protegiendo los bosques existentes o plantando árboles. Los gobiernos afirman que los programas transfieren el control de los bosques a la gente y que proveen medios de subsistencia más seguros al tiempo que ayudan a mantener y regenerar los bosques. Al compartir los derechos entre los grupos locales y el estado, los programas también ayudan a reconciliar el reclamo de la población local a los recursos con los reclamos del gobierno nacional. Aparentemente todos ganan.</descri>

  <descri>Hasta finales de la década de los sesenta, los pobladores de la isla San Salvador, en Filipinas, gozaban del acceso libre e ilimitado a los recursos naturales costeros. A principios de los años setenta, una ola de inmigración, combinada con la integración de la economía de la isla al mercado internacional de peces ornamentales, y el cambio hacia las operaciones de pesca destructivas, arruinaron las zonas pesqueras y dieron lugar a los conflictos. Las reclamaciones del gobierno al completo control sobre el uso y protección de los recursos marinos y costeros no pusieron fin a la destrucción o degradación de los recursos.</descri>

  <title>Derechos de propiedad, acción colectiva y agrosilvicultura</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>La agrosilvicultura trata sobre los sistemas agrícolas integrados, en que los árboles juegan un papel prominente. La agrosilvicultura puede proporcionar una variedad de funciones o beneficios para los agricultores y las comunidades. Los más fáciles de identificar son los productos forestales utilizados por los humanos: leña para fuego, madera, vigas, frutas, medicinas y resinas. Un segundo grupo de beneficios consiste en los servicios que proporcionan los árboles a otras actividades agrícolas de los agricultores: abono vegetal, sombra, conservación de los suelos y estacas. Un tercer grupo incluye los beneficios en toda la comunidad o incluso los beneficios globales de los sistemas de agrosilvicultura: la biodiversidad, la protección de las cuencas, la captura de carbón y la regulación del microclima. En este resumen analizamos el papel que las instituciones sociales —específicamente los derechos de propiedad y la acción colectiva— pueden jugar en el desarrollo de la agrosilvicultura.</descri>

  <title>The impact of agroforestry-based soil fertility replenishment practices on the poor in western Kenya</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This case study explores the relationships between agroforestry-based soil fertility replenishment (SFR) systems (improved follows and biomass transfer) and poverty reduction in rural western Kenya. It further examines the role that different dissemination aproaches play in the conditioning which segments of society gain access to information to the technlolgies and then uses them. The study made use of many different qualitative data collection methods and samples from both pilot areas where researchers maintained a significant presence and nonpilot areas where farmers learned of the technologies through other channels. Adoption processes were analyzed quantitatively using almost 2,000 households while changes in impact indicators were measured for just over 100 households. Quaalitative methods included case studies for 40 households, where researchers lived in the villages for six months, and focus group discussion involving 16 different groups.</descri>

  <title>The importance of women's status for child nutrition in developing countries</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>One in every three preschool-aged children living in developing countries is malnourished. This disturbing yet preventable state of affairs causes untold suffering and, given its wide scale, is a major obstacle to the development process itself. Volumes have been written about the causes of child malnutrition and the actions that can be taken to reduce it— ranging from community-based feeding programs to accelerated economic growth (Smith and Haddad 2000). Until recently, too little attention has been paid to an obviously relevant yet little noticed issue: the role that the capabilities and well-being of children’s caretakers, usually their mothers, play in children’s nutritional well-being. This issue is the subject of this study.</descri>

  <title>Measuring Power</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Much empirical work has approached the problem of how resource allocations are made within households from the perspective that if preferences differ, welfare outcomes depend on the power of individuals to exert their own preferences. Measures of power are therefore a central component of quantitative empirical approaches to understanding how different preferences translate into different welfare outcomes. Following most of the empirical studies in this genre, this chapter focuses on dynamics within couples.</descri>

  <title>What have we learned from research on intrahousehold allocation?</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Many decisions that affect the well-being of individuals are made within families or households. The processes by which resources are allocated among individuals and the outcomes of those processes are commonly referred to as “intrahousehold resource allocation.” Since the early 1990s a growing literature has paid increasing attention to the role that intrahousehold resource allocation plays in affecting the outcome of development policy (see Strauss and Thomas 1995; Behrman 1997; Haddad, Hoddinott, and Alderman 1997 for reviews). This literature questions the traditional view that individuals within the household share the same preferences or pool their resources. The literature also recognizes that rights, resources, and responsibilities of household members—especially men and women—may be different. </descri>

  <title>Agriculture and natural resources: Overview</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Much has been written about the importance of gender issues in designing and implementing agricultural evelopment projects (Cloud 1983; Alderman et al. 1994; Quisumbing et al. 1998). Part of this literature has been motivated by the important role that women play in food production, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (Boserup 1970; Dixon 1982; Gladwin and Macmillan 1989), as well as in the management of natural resources (Meinzen-Dick et al. 1997). A significant portion of this literature has also arisen because of the unintended consequences of agricultural development projects that were implemented without taking into account the different rights, resources, and responsibilities of men and women within the household (for example, Jones 1983; Dey 1985; Braun and Webb 1989).</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>While fishing must surely be one of the oldest recorded sources of livelihood, it is only comparatively recently that fish have become important components of the diets of the majority of the world’s people—especially those living in developing countries. Consumption of fish and seafood products reached 14 kilograms per capita in developing countries in 2001, nearly twice the level recorded in the early 1970s, while population in those countries doubled over the same period. Fish are an important component of the rapid growth of the consumption of animal products in developing countries over the past two decades and into the
foreseeable future.

  <title>In pursuit of comparable concepts and data about collective action</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Research on collective action confronts two major obstacles. First, inconsistency in the conceptualization and operationalization of collective action, the key factors expected to affect collective action, and the outcomes of collective action hampers the accumulation of knowledge. Inconsistent terminology obscures consistent patterns. Second, the scarcity of comparable data thwarts evaluation of the relative importance of the many variables identified in the literature as likely to influence collective action. The International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research program addresses both of these problems. Since its founding in 1993, the IFRI network of collaborating research centers has used a common set of methods and concepts to study forests, the people who use forest resources, and their institutions for resource management. The basic social unit of analysis in IFRI is the user group, defined as a set of individuals with the same rights and responsibilities to forest resources. This definition does not require formal organization or collective action, since these features are potential dependent variables. This strategy for data collection allows analysis of relationships between diverse forms of social heterogeneity and collective action within groups with comparable rights to resources. IFRI's relational database also captures the connections among forest systems, sets of resource users, particular forest products, formal and informal rules for resource use, and formal local and supra-local organizations. By the middle of 2001, the IFRI database included data on 141 sites with 231 forests, 233 user groups, 94 forest organizations, and 486 products in 12 countries. Drawing upon these data, IFRI researchers are contributing substantially to our understanding of collective action for institutional development, the mediating role institutions play relative to demographic and market pressures in patterns of resource use, and relationships between particular institutions and forest conditions. The paper describes IFRI's strategy for collecting comparable data based on consistent conceptualization and operationalization, summarizes the contributions of IFRI research to the study of collective action for natural resource management, and identifies continuing challenges.</descri>

  <title>Changes in intrahousehold labor allocation to environment goods collection: A case study from rural Nepal, 1982 and 1987</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study explores the impact of changes in environmental conditions on household labor allocation to the collection of environmental goods such as fuelwood and leaf fodder for a sample of rural Nepali hill households. Households in rural areas of most developing countries often rely heavily on the surrounding environment for goods such as water, wood, and livestock fodder. Frequently these and other environmental products are collected from local common forestland, a task that in many areas is predominantly carried out by women. Given the increasing pressure on biomass resources in many developing areas and the common gender division of collection labor, there is concern that women in particular will bear the burden of increases in resource scarcity by having to spend more labor time and effort to collect forest products.</descri>

  <descri>The bargaining power of men and women crucially shapes the resource allocation decisions households make (Quisumbing and de la Brière 2000). Husbands and wives often use their bargaining power to express different priorities about how resources should be allocated. Understanding these differences and their effects is critical if policymakers are to improve livelihoods. Increasing the bargaining power of one gender group rather than another can mean the difference between policy failure and policy success.</descri>

  <descri>Agrowing body of literature suggests that men and women allocate resources under their control in systematically different ways. Studies examining the effect of women’s income on household expenditure patterns find that women typically spend a higher proportion of their income on food and health care for children, as well as other goods for general household consumption, than do men.1 Other evidence from developing countries shows that female income more often has a greater impact than male income on infant and child survival probabilities, preschooler nutrition, and child education (Doss 1997; Thomas 1994).</descri>

  <title>Gendered participation in water management: issues from water users' associations in South Asia</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The devolution of natural resource management responsibility from the state to communities or local user groups has become a widespread trend that cuts across countries and resource sectors. Unlike claims to the contrary in policy narratives, devolution of control over resources from the state to local organizations does not necessarily lead to greater participation and empowerment of all stakeholders (Cleaver 1999). Because the outcome of devolution programs hinges on the activity of local organizations, this study (Meinzen-Dick and Zwarteveen 1998) examines the extent and forms of women’s participation in these organizations, using examples of water users’ associations in South Asia. This chapter tries to draw out the main issues, illustrate them with empirical examples, and examine ways to increase women’s involvement in resource management organizations.</descri>

  <title>The impact of PROGRESA on women's status and intrahousehold relations</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Since 1997 Mexico has provided poor families with cash benefits linked to children’s school attendance and regular clinic attendance, as well as in-kind health benefits and nutritional supplements, through the Programa Nacional de Educación, Salud y Alimentación (PROGRESA). Unlike previous social programs in Mexico, this nationwide antipoverty program targets transfers to the mother of the family. Planners deliberately decided to give transfers directly to the mother because of the growing literature that finds that resources controlled by women are more likely to be manifested in greater improvements in child health and nutrition than resources controlled by men.</descri>

  <title>Social capital and gender in South Africa, 1993-98</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The concept of social capital, well grounded in the sociological and anthropological literatures (for example, Coleman 1988), is increasingly being analyzed and used by economists and other development policy practitioners. The entry point for many economists is Robert Putnam’s research on Italian regional economic performance (Putnam 1993) and his subsequent work in the United States. For Putnam, “social capital refers to features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit” (Putnam 1995, 67). This research adds a gender dimension to the debate providing empirical evidence on the role of social capital. The goal of the research is to determine whether men and women have social capital to the same degree and whether men’s and women’s social capital, proxied by membership in formal and informal groups, had differential effects on household welfare in South Africa in the 1990s.</descri>

  <title>Control and ownership of assets within rural Ethiopian households</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>There is renewed interest in the intrahousehold allocation of welfare, particularly among economists studying poor countries where even slight differences in the allocation of household resources can have dramatic consequences on child and female nutrition, morbidity, and mortality (Haddad and Hoddinott 1994; Rose 1999; Dercon and Krishnan 2000). The evidence collected so far tends to demonstrate that the allocation of consumption and leisure among household members varies systematically with their relative contributions to household total income (Thomas 1990; Alderman et al. 1995; Bourguignon, Browning, and Chiappori 1995). These results, however, provide no guidance about which policies affect intrahousehold outcomes. Various efforts have been made to fill this lacuna,  focusing on the determinants of intrahousehold resource allocation. Some research has emphasized the influence that “threat points”—the utility each spouse has outside marriage—are likely to have on spouses’ bargaining power and hence on intrahousehold welfare (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981). If this approach is correct, one may hope to affect intrahousehold welfare by improving the “exit options” of disadvantaged groups.</descri>

  <title>Modeling the effects of trade on women: the case of Zambia</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Despite substantial economic liberalization since the early 1990s, nontraditional exports in Zambia have grown only moderately and agricultural performance overall has been disappointing. Though agriculture accounts for less than 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), it is the most important source of employment, especially for women. Interpretations of Zambia’s poor performance variously emphasize external factors, such as declining copper prices and vulnerability to weather shocks, and market imperfections. Several authors also point to the importance of women in agriculture and explain the very low supply response by the constraints that women face, in terms of both limited access to assets and burden of work within households (Blackden and Selim 1993; Wold 1997).</descri>

  <title>Women's land rights in the transition to individualized ownership: implications or tree resources in Western Ghana</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study explores the impact of changes in land tenure institutions on women’s land rights and the efficiency of tree resource management in western Ghana, where cocoa is the dominant crop. Although communal land tenure aims to provide equitable access to land for all households, women’s land rights in the region are weaker than those of men, as is often the case under customary land tenure systems (Lastarria-Cornhiel 1997). If women are blocked from having secure land rights, and therefore from individualized investment in land, the resulting barrier to increased productivity will diminish their incentives to sustain resource use over time (Meinzen-Dick et al. 1997).</descri>

  <descri>The early work on intrahousehold allocation alerted researchers and policymakers to the possible policy failures that could arise from neglect of intrahousehold allocation issues (Haddad, Hoddinott, and Alderman 1997). Conversely, what are the policy gains from paying attention to these issues? The new research on intrahousehold issues provides evidence that policies and interventions can be made more effective when differential rights, resources, and responsibilities within the household are explicitly considered.</descri>

  <title>Household structure and child well-being: evidence from KwaZulu-Natal</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Before 1994 the policy of apartheid in South Africa had systematically denied the majority of the population access to resources through legal restrictions on mobility, property rights, and residential location (Thompson 1990). South African industry fulfilled labor requirements in key industries largely using migrant laborers—mostly men—who worked in one place while their families resided elsewhere. As a result, many South African families have been characterized as “double-rooted,” with one root in the poorer, more rural areas designated for blacks relying on income from the other root in the higher-income, urban, industrial, and mining areas. In 1993 one in four of all black South African households were dependent on remittance income (Carter and May 1999). Moreover, it is estimated that more than 50 percent of all black children age six and under were not living with their father, and 15 percent of these children were also not living with their mother.</descri>

  <title>Microfinance</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Among financial institutions serving poor households around the world, microfinance programs have emerged as important players. These programs typically make small loans—sometimes as small as US$50 to US$100 and sometimes as large as several thousand dollars-to households lacking access to formal-sector banks (see, for example, Lapenu and Zeller 2001). One important achievement of the microfinance movement has been its relative success in deliberately reaching out to poor women living in diverse socioeconomic environments. More than 90 percent of the clients of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, perhaps the most well-known microfinance institution worldwide, are women (Khandker, Khalily, and Khan 1996). Of the nearly 189,587 village bank members worldwide that received loans from the Foundation for International Community Assistance in 2001, most are women (FINCA 2002). The Association for Social Advancement (ASA), another prominent microfinance institution in Bangladesh, has a client base of more than 1.5 million persons, out of which 96 percent are women (ASA 2002). In Malawi 95 percent of loans provided by the Malawi Muzdi Fund go to women borrowers (Diagne and Zeller 2001). The microfinance networks led and catalyzed by Women’s World Banking provide direct credit services to more than 12 million poor people around the world. Literally hundreds of similar examples can be found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</descri>

  <title>Social captial, legal institutions, and property rights: Overview</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The previous sections have highlighted the importance of assets as a determinant of bargaining power within marriage. Both formal and informal institutions underlie asset accumulation and provide the basis for property rights. When women face social and legal restrictions in acquiring certain forms of assets, such as land, they may resort to accumulating other “assets” and investing in other forms of capital. One of these forms of capital is social capital, which includes any networks that increase trust, ability to work together, access to opportunities, and reciprocity; informal safety nets; and membership in organizations (Chambers and Conway 1992; Scoones 1998; Devereux 2001; Adato and Meinzen-Dick 2002). For example, working through groups is one major mechanism through which outside programs and women themselves can improve their status (Quisumbing and Meinzen-Dick 2001; Dikito-Wachtmeister 2001). In fact, the networks and collective action that groups generate are now being recognized as an asset in itself. Social capital may be one asset in which women are less disadvantaged or even hold an advantage. Microfinance is perhaps the best-known type of program that works through women’s groups. Group savings, credit, and insurance programs for women substitute collective action through the groups for conventional assets (such as land) as collateral (Sharma 2001).</descri>

Poverty has kept generations of families from sending their children to school, and without education their children’s future will be a distressing echo of their own. Furthermore, from birth, children from poor families are often deprived of the basic nutritional building blocks that they need to learn easily. Consequently, the pathway out of poverty is restricted for children from poor families.</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Mexico’s Programa Nacional de Educación, Salud y Alimentación (PROGRESA) is a major government program aimed at developing the human capital of poor households. Targeting its benefits directly to the population in extreme poverty in rural areas, it seeks to alleviate current poverty through monetary and in-kind benefits, as well as to reduce future levels of poverty by encouraging investments in education, health, and nutrition. This chapter (based on Skoufias and McClafferty 2001) summarizes 24 months of extensive IFPRI research designed to evaluate whether PROGRESA has been successful in achieving its goals. The evaluation analyzed PROGRESA’s impact on education, health, and nutrition as well as in other areas, such as women’s status and work incentives (see Adato et al., Chapter 30).</descri>

  <descri>With increasing urbanization, the percentage of women participating in the labor force and the percentage of households headed by single mothers have increased. Reliable and affordable child-care alternatives are thus becoming increasingly important in urban areas. The Hogares Comunitarios Program (HCP) was established in Guatemala City in 1991 as a direct response to the increasing need of poor urban dwellers for substitute childcare. This government-sponsored pilot program was designed as a strategy to alleviate poverty by providing working parents with low-cost, high-quality childcare within their community.</descri>

  <title>Adult health in the time of drought</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>It is a well-known fact that households in developing countries often undergo weather-related and other shocks that drastically affect incomes. A large and growing literature explores the effectiveness of response to these events. One strand of the literature addresses the strategies that households and governments use to protect against income shocks (Udry 1990; Fafchamps, Udry, and Czukas 1998; Kochar 1999). A second strand looks at the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing fluctuations in consumption. The principal result, summarized in Morduch (1995, 1999a) and Townsend (1995), is that some, but not all, households are able to smooth consumption. Households facing liquidity constraints, in particular, have limited smoothing ability. For these households, income fluctuations lead to a welfare loss.</descri>

  <title>Methods of consensus building for community based fisheries management in Bangladesh and the Mekong Delta</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>A method of consensus building for management of wetlands and fisheries using a systematic approach to participatory planning and initially developed in Bangladesh is now being applied in both Bangladesh and the Mekong delta. The method recognizes diversity in livelihoods and works through a structured learning and planning process that focuses on common interests. It works with each category of stakeholder separately to prioritize the natural resource problems that their livelihoods are largely dependent on, they then share and agree common priorities in plenary. Then the stakeholder groups separately analyze possible solutions and their impacts, before meeting in plenary to share their analysis and form a consensus on win-win solutions. The process identifies the collective actions that are needed to arrive at preferred solutions, and determines potential impacts on different stakeholders and responsibilities for implementation, monitoring and evaluation. We outline the process in the context of building social capital through consensus, and compare indicators of social capital as an outcome of its application in a Vietnamese village in the Mekong delta with the outcomes of a similar process in a floodplain wetland in Bangladesh.</descri>

  <title>Intrahousehold impact of the transfer of modern agricultural technology: A gender perspective</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Micronutrient malnutrition is a serious problem in developing countries. It is well established that micronutrient requirements are greater for women and children because of their special needs for reproduction and growth. Unfortunately, however, women and children suffer most from micronutrient deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiency impairs the cognitive development of young children, retards physical growth, increases child mortality, and contributes to the problem of maternal death during childbirth.</descri>

  <title>Effects on diet in improving the iron status of women: what role for food-based interventions?</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects more than 3.5 people in the developing world. More than half of pregnant women (56 percent) and 44 percent of nonpregnant women are anemic (ACC/SCN 2000). IDA contributes to approximately 20 percent of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia (Ross and Thomas 1996). In Africa alone, some 20,000 maternal deaths per year could be prevented with anemia treatment. Poor diet quality and low bioavailability of dietary iron are important factors contributing to iron deficiency anemia (IDA), so one proposed solution to IDA consists of food-based interventions designed to improve people’s diets. Yet little has been known about the magnitude of the effects of various components of the diet in reducing IDA under actual living conditions in rural areas. Can food-based interventions be successful in reducing IDA? Will such interventions be cost-effective compared with alternative interventions such as supplementation?</descri>

  <title>Commercial vegetable and polyculture fish production in Bangladesh: Impacts on income, food consumption, and nutrition</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>In rural areas of Bangladesh, poverty is pervasive and associated with high rates of malnutrition, especially among preschool children and women. Apart from low levels of energy intakes, it is increasingly recognized that rice-dominated diets such as those consumed by most poor in the countryside may not supply all micronutrients required for a healthy life and productive activities. Children and women are particularly vulnerable to these micronutrient deficiencies because they face relatively higher requirements for growth and reproduction. In Bangladesh, as in other countries in South Asia (see Smith et al., Chapter 6), a pro-male bias in food distribution owing to women’s low status and bargaining power within the household may underlie women’s inability to meet their micronutrient requirements.</descri>

  <title>Supply response of West African agricultural households: implications of intrahousehold preference heterogeneity</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Traditional models of household economic behavior have portrayed households as unified entities. They assume that household members agree about decisions and share resources in the most equitable way possible. More recently, however, economists have come to view households as domains of difference, where multiple decisionmakers may have different preferences and, in many cases, control separate sets of resources. This new approach has greatly improved understanding of household resource allocation behavior. It has demonstrated that heterogeneity among members affects a variety of individual, household, and economywide outcomes (Haddad, Hoddinott, and Alderman 1997). Recent research on West African households, in particular, has shown that gender differences in resource allocation behavior result in inefficiencies that reduce overall household production and income (Udry 1996).</descri>

  <title>Gender differentials in farm productivity: Implications for household efficiancy and agricultural policy</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This chapter challenges one of the main tenets of agricultural economics—that households behave as though they are single individuals, with production factors allocated efficiently between men and women. In many contexts this is a convenient and innocuous assumption. It can be quite restrictive, however, when investigating the causes and welfare consequences of gender differences in agriculture. In response to a growing number of econometric studies that have found strong evidence against the hypothesis that households act as if they are individuals, researchers have proposed a number of different models of the interaction that occurs between individuals within the household. Many of these models share with the standard model the assumption that the allocation of resources is Pareto efficient. These models make a variety of alternative assumptions, however, concerning the sharing rule within the household and the threat points used as fallback positions by the individuals in the household in the event that a cooperative equilibrium is not achieved.</descri>

  <title>Power and Resources within the Household: Overview</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The collective model of the household predicts that bargaining power determines the share of resources allocated to an individual within the household. The concept of bargaining power is elusive, however. It is perhaps useful at this point to outline the possible determinants of bargaining power, while not making any claims to measure power itself. Bargaining power is affected by four sets of determinants: (1) control over resources, such as assets; (2) factors that can be used to influence the bargaining process; (3) mobilization of interpersonal networks; and (4) basic attitudinal attributes.</descri>

  <title>Intrahousehold Allocation and Gender Relations: New Empirical Evidence from Four Developing Countries</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Most economic research treats the household as a single agent, assuming that individuals within the household share the same preferences or that there is a household “head” who has the final say. This simple framework has proved immensely useful; despite a common misperception, it can explain many differences in well-being or consumption patterns within households. Nonetheless, recent empirical research demonstrates that this “unitary” household model is inappropriate in a variety of settings in both developed and developing countries (see Haddad, Hoddinott, and Alderman 1997 for reviews).</descri>

  <descri>"To end hunger and prevent the recurrence of famine and starvation, we need to take the following steps: invest in public health, child nutrition, education, women’s and girls’ social status, and other components of human capital; reform public institutions and create innovative funding and partnership arrangements;  change government policies at all levels to be both pro-poor and pro-growth;  increase funding for scientific and technological research to boost agricultural production and efficiency; and develop specific policies and institutions to deal with environmental degradation caused by population growth. The international community, national governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector must cooperate to bring about these changes, which reach beyond redistribution programs, narrowly focused market-oriented solutions, or campaigns based solely on local self-reliance." -- from text</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study examines the implications of gender differences in wealth transfers—farmland and education—on the lifetime incomes of men and women in the rural areas of Ghana, the Philippines, and Sumatra. Based on household surveys of three generations, we tested the hypothesis that parents bequeath their wealth to their sons and daughters in accordance with their comparative advantages in lowland and upland farming and in nonfarm jobs. Therefore, if sons and daughters have comparative advantages in lowland farming and nonfarming activities, respectively, we expect that sons receive a greater area of farmland, whereas daughters receive more schooling, since schooling is particularly important in nonfarm jobs.</descri>

  <title>Mettre fin a la famine en Afrique</title>
  <subtit>seuls les petits agriculteurs peuvent y parvenir</subtit>
  <descri>Contrairement aux prévisions communément admises quant à l’aggravation du déclin économique de l’Afrique, une récente étude présente une vision alternative plus positive de l’avenir de ce continent. De nouveaux engagements politiques, une gestion du programme de développement sous égide africaine ainsi que l’accroissement de l’intérêt et des investissements dans les petites exploitations agricoles ont le potentiel d’arrêter, voire d’inverser la tendance spiroïdale de la famine, de la pauvreté, de la dégradation environnementale, des maladies et des guerres civiles. Tirant les leçons des politiques passées et des erreurs de mise en oeuvre, ce dossier atteste qu’il est aujourd’hui temps de concentrer les efforts sur les piliers de la croissance afin de revitaliser le secteur agricole. Le succès tient à la coordination de ces efforts au moyen de plans d’action régionaux et nationaux tels que ceux préconisés par l’Agence des États-Unis pour le Développement international (USAID) dans le cadre de sa récente initiative agricole pour stopper la famine en Afrique (Agricultural Initiative to Cut Hunger in Africa, AICHA). Ces plans d’actions doivent être conçus conjointement par les donateurs et leurs partenaires africains, afin de promouvoir pour le secteur agricole des investissements tenant compte des contraintes locales. Ils doivent être soutenus par une analyse, un contrôle et une évaluation des résultats rigoureux, tout en favorisant la transparence et la responsabilité financière."-- de la dossier</descri>

  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>En las últimas décadas, el mundo ha hecho un progreso impresionante para mejorar la calidad de vida de millones de personas; sin embargo, todavía sigue inconclusa la tarea de garantizar la seguridad alimentaria a los más pobres de una manera sostenible. La explosión demográfica, la expansión urbana, la desnutrición y la mala salud persistentes, las tierras agrícolas degradadas y el agua escasa, la carencia de poder de las mujeres, la globalización acelerada y la rápida aparición de nuevas tecnologías - todos estos y muchos otros factores están influenciando este esfuerzo continuo. Este libro compila docenas de resúmenes y artículos para presentar las perspectivas de los expertos sobre estos tópicos vitales. Producidas como parte de la iniciativa “Visión de la alimentación, la agricultura y el medio ambiente en el año 2020,” del Instituto Internacional de Investigaciones sobre Políticas Alimentarias, las piezas coleccionadas aquí ofrecen una representación completa de los temas de política que el mundo debe abordar si ha de superar la pobreza, el hambre y la degradación ambiental; y le señalan además el camino a las acciones de política que deben ejecutarse para lograr estos objetivos.</descri>

  <title>Balancing agricultural development and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Since the 1970s, federal policies promoting migration and encouraging agricultural development of large farms, logging, and ranching have led to the deforestation of vast areas of the Amazon rainforest.Though these policies have largely been replaced, deforestation continues. What effects do current macroeconomic and regional policies and events have on deforestation and on the well-being of settlers on the agricultural frontier? This report identifies the links between the agriculture and logging sectors in the Amazon, economic growth, poverty alleviation, and natural resource degradation in the region and in Brazil as a whole. It considers the effects of currency devaluation, building roads and other infrastructure in the Amazon, property rights, adoption of technological change, and fiscal incentives and disincentives to deforest.The results are sometimes counterintuitive, but shed new light on why slowing deforestation is so difficult and on the trade-offs between environmental and economic goals. -- Author's Abstract</descri>

  <title>Fish as food</title>
  <subtit>projections to 2020 under different scenarios</subtit>
  <descri>"This paper reports results of incorporating fish into IMPACT, a global model of food supply and demand that estimates market-clearing prices to 2020 for 32 commodities in 36 regions. It summarizes results for production, consumption, net exports and real price changes for 10 economic categories of fisheries items, disaggregated into 15 geographic regions of the world. Under the medium-variant scenario for the uncertain capture fisheries sectors, global production of food fish is projected to rise by 1.5% annually through 2020, with two-thirds of this from aquaculture, whose share in total food fish production rises to 41%. Global per capita fish consumption is projected to be 17.1 kg in 2020, with sensitivity analysis indicating a margin of 2 kg/capita either way based on extreme scenarios for capture and aquaculture. Most growth will occur in developing countries, which will account for 79% of food fish production in 2020. China's share of world production will continue to expand, while that of Japan, the EU, and former USSR will continue to contract. Real fish prices will rise 4 to 16% by 2020, while meat prices will fall 3%. Fishmeal and oil prices will rise 18%; use of these commodities will increasingly be concentrated in carnivorous   aquaculture. Growing domestic demand will dampen fish exports from developing countries. Sensitivity analysis incorporating a very pessimistic view of capture fisheries leads to escalating food fish prices (+69% for high-value finfish) and soaring fishmeal prices (+134%), whereas an optimistic view of increased investment in aquaculture lowers real prices of low value food fish (-12%), and raises fishmeal prices (+42%)." -- Authors' Abstract</descri>

  <title>Ending hunger in Africa</title>
  <subtit>only the small farmer can do it</subtit>
  <descri>"In contrast to popular predictions of Africa’s worsening economic decline, recent research supports an alternative and more positive vision of Africa’s future. New political commitment and African ownership of the development agenda, combined with a renewed focus on and investments in smallholder-led agriculture, have the potential to halt or reverse the current downward spiral of hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, disease, and civil strife. Building on lessons learned from past policy and implementation mistakes, this policy brief argues that now is the time to address key pillars of growth to revitalize the agriculture sector.... [This brief is based on an IFPRI technical paper in support of USAID’s Agricultural Initiative to Cut Hunger in Africa (AICHA),] in which investments to support agricultural growth are planned for three subregions: East,West, and Southern  Africa. Each regional action plan will link to and harmonize with national action plans in selected high-potential countries that are also expected to serve as nodes of agriculture-led growth within their subregions. All action plans will describe the process by which investment priorities and related analytical agendas will be developed, fine-tuned, and acted upon. USAID describes the action plans as documents that will include a 15-year vision of the initiative, specific programmatic thrusts for a five-year planning cycle, and annual work plans and targeted outputs. They are expected to be “rolling” planning documents that will also provide monitoring and evaluation information in accordance with a results framework established in the first action plan. Each plan will assess the likely impacts of the proposed investments on (1) overall economic and agricultural growth, (2) agricultural trade, (3) intraregional trade, (4) spillover effects through intraregional linkages in commodity and factor markets, and (5) regional growth, development, and hunger and poverty reduction."-- taken from Brief</descri>

  <title>Reaching sustainable food security for all by 2020</title>
  <subtit>getting the priorities and responsibilities right</subtit>
  <descri>"As part of its 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment Initiative, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has articulated a vision of what the world should look like in 2020: it should be a world free from poverty, hunger, malnutrition, and unsustainable natural resource management. The 2020 Vision Initiative has two main objectives: (1) to develop and promote a shared vision and consensus for action for meeting food needs while reducing poverty and protecting the environment; and (2) to generate information and encourage debate to influence action by national governments, nongovernmental organizations, business and industry, international development institutions, farmers, and other elements of civil society. In September 2001, IFPRI and its 2020 Vision Initiative, in collaboration with partners, sponsored an international conference in Bonn, Germany, to bring together the actors needed to achieve this vision. The 900 people who attended the conference considered the driving forces that will determine the difficulty of achieving the 2020 Vision, and they articulated the steps required to build the world the Vision describes.This document reflects many of their discussions. Compiled here is what is known about the conditions facing the world in the next 20 years and about how to overcome the persistent and interlocking problems of food insecurity, poverty, and environmental degradation." -- Introduction.</descri>

  <title>Development pathways and land management in Uganda</title>
  <subtit>causes and implications</subtit>
  <descri>This paper investigates the patterns and determinants of change in livelihood strategies ("development pathways" ), land management practices, agricultural productivity, resource and human welfare conditions in Uganda since 1990, based upon a community- level survey conducted in 107 villages. Six dominant development pathways emerged, all but one of which involved increasing specialization in already dominant activities: expansion of cereal production, expansion of banana and coffee production, non- farm development, expansion of horticultural production, expansion of cotton, and stable coffee production.</descri>

  <title>Land tenure and natural resource management</title>
  <subtit>a comparative study of agrarian communities in Asia and Africa</subtit>
  <descri>The devastating environmental effects of deforestation and the exploitation of other natural resources in the developing world have been well documented, yet their impact on local communities has received far less attention. This volume fills this gap by looking at how land degradation and deforestation are being addressed at the local level, where households have experienced the reduction of farm size and the decline of natural resources. Through a comparison of Asia and Africa, Land Tenure and Natural Resource Management examines the evolution of land tenure institutions within diverse cultural, natural, and policy environments. Specific topics include the evolution of customary land tenure, the impacts of land tenure policies, and common property management. The editors conclude that the best strategy for managing land and forest resources lies in promoting the establishment of property rights and investment in the improvement of the natural resource base. Topics Include: Issues and Theoretical Framework; Quantitative Methodology; Agroforestry Management in Ghana; Agroforestry Management in Sumatra; Tree and Cropland Management in Malawi; Customary and Private Land Management in Uganda; Management of State Land and Privatization in Vietnam; Common Property Forest Management in the Hill Region of Nepal; Timber Forest Management in Nepal and Japan Toward New Paradigms of Land and Tree Resource Management.</descri>

  <title>Tribes, state, and technology adoption in arid land management, Syria</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Arid shrub-lands in Syria and elsewhere in West Asia and North Africa are widely thought degraded. Characteristic of these areas is a preponderance of unpalatable shrubs or a lack of overall ground cover with a rise in the associated risks of soil erosion. Migrating pastoralists have been the scapegoats for this condition of the range. State steppe interventions of the last forty years have reflected this with programs to supplant customary systems with structures and institutions promoting western grazing systems and technologies. Principal amongst the latter has been shrub technology, particularly Atriplex species, for use in land rehabilitation and as a fodder reserve. This paper deconstructs state steppe policy in Syria by examining the overlap and interface of government and customary legal systems as a factor in the history of shrub technology transfer in the Syrian steppe. It is argued that the link made between signs of degradation and perceived moribund customary systems is not at all causal. Indeed, customary systems are found to be adaptive and resilient, and a strong influence on steppe management and the fate of technology transfer initiatives. Furthermore, developments in rangeland ecology raise questions about claims for grazing-induced degradation and call for a reinterpretation of recent shifts in vegetation on the Syrian steppe. Given the ineffectiveness of past state interventions, and in view of renewed understanding of customary systems and rangeland ecology, decentralization and some devolution of formal management responsibility is likely to be a viable and an attractive option for policymakers.</descri>

  <title>Land dispute resolution in Mozambique</title>
  <subtit>institutions and evidence of agroforestry technology adoption</subtit>
  <descri>Successful adoption of natural resource management technologies requires that important fundamentals of property rights be established. Because disputes over property rights occur universally, the ability to successfully defend one's rights to property exercises a central influence on the tenure security necessary for technology adoption. However, defending rights to property rests upon the possession of evidence that is readily available and widely regarded as legitimate. This paper presents work carried out in postwar Mozambique on the availability and legitimacy of evidence pertaining to land tenure dispute resolution. What is unusual about the Mozambique case is that the physical presence of a natural resource management technology -agroforestry trees in this case - also serves as one of the most widely available and legitimate forms of evidence in the postwar period. Such an arrangement reveals important aspects about the reverse relationship between property rights and technology adoption. While such an evidence role for a technology may at first appear to encourage further adoption of agroforestry, important influences on property rights in the postwar setting serve to discourage full adoption and jeopardize the long-term presence of existing agroforestry trees. It remains to be seen if recent legislative changes regarding property rights will successfully engage customary forms of evidence and encourage full adoption of agroforestry in Mozambique.</descri>

  <title>Monitoring systems for managing natural resources</title>
  <subtit>economics, indicators and environmental externalities in a Costa Rican watershed</subtit>
  <descri>The worsening degradation of natural resources urgently requires the adoption of more sustainable management practices. This need has led to growing interest and investment in monitoring systems for tracking the condition of natural resources. This study is concerned with the design of monitoring systems that have direct relevance for the management of natural resources. We call these Policy Relevant Monitoring Systems (PRMS). Such systems have several key characteristics. They provide: a) a decision framework for selecting resource problems to monitor that offer potentially large social payoffs relative to the costs of monitoring, b) timely, including early warning information on emerging problems, c) a means of identifying the causes of an emerging problem, d) an analytical framework for identifying options for corrective action, e) an institutional framework for achieving ownership among key stakeholders (the resource users and those affected by the resource use) and agreement about emerging problems, the corrective actions to take, and effective implementation, and f) a built-in mechanism for learning from past experience to improve the performance of the monitoring system over time. The approach is developed and illustrated through detailed examination of the Arenal-Tempisque watershed in Costa Rica. This watershed exhibits classic multiple user and externality problems: deforestation by dairy and cattle farmers in the upper watershed leads to soil erosion and siltation of the various reservoirs that feed an important hydro-electric power generation system, and agro-chemical use by irrigated farmers has adverse impacts on a highly valued wetlands park and on wildlife and fishing in the lower reaches of the watershed.</descri>

  <title>Land, trees, and women</title>
  <subtit>evolution of land tenure institutions in Western Ghana and Sumatra</subtit>
  <descri>This research report examines three questions that are central to IFPRI research: How do property-rights institutions affect efficiency and equity? How are resources allocated within households? Why does this matter from a policy perspective? As part of a larger multicountry study on property rights to land and trees, this study focuses on the evolution  from customary land tenure with communal ownership toward individualized rights, and how this shift affects women and men differently.This study’s key contribution is its multilevel econometric analysis of efficiency and equity issues. Using a combination of community, village, and household surveys in Western Ghana and Sumatra, two areas with traditional matrilineal inheritance systems, the authors and their collaborators analyze the effectiveness of village-, household-, and parcel-level property-rights institutions and  arrangements.</descri>

  <title>A computable general equilibrium analysis of Mexico's agricultural policy reforms</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Since the late 1980s, Mexico has liberalized its agricultural sector, moving from a system of price supports, producer subsidies and consumer subsidies to a less distorting scheme in which market forces play a greater role. Coinciding with these agrarian and food policy reforms, the government has implemented the PROCAMPO system of direct payments to farmers. There is a general consensus that a direct payment program has the potential to be more efficient than a system of subsidies and supports. At the same time, there is widespread agreement that other policies need to be put in place to assure protection of the economically vulnerable segments of the population. Within this context, this paper uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze the regional, household and economy-wide effects of switching from the old system of price supports and subsidies to the new system of PROCAMPO payments. A CGE model of Mexico is constructed with four rural regions and one urban region and a high disaggregation of the agricultural and food sectors. It also includes 15 households, defined according to region and income level to permit a rich analysis of distribution effects. The initial experiment consists of removing the PROCAMPO payments from the base year (1996) and adding back the subsidy and support scheme as it existed in 1993, the year before PROCAMPO began. Then two policies are tested under an exchange rate depreciation to see how each policy regime reacts to adverse shocks. The simulations demonstrate that in a static situation, lump sum payments are preferred to the system of subsidies and price supports. In the event of a negative external shock, the simulations suggest that the old system performs better in terms of output and rural incomes. However, urban households are worse off, and their size in total population may make this an unattractive policy."</descri>

  <title>Strategies for sustainable agricultural development in the Ethiopian Highlands</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This paper investigates the impacts of population growth, market access, agricultural credit and technical assistance programs, land policies, livelihood strategies and other factors on changes in land management, natural resource conditions and human welfare indicators since 1991 in the northern Ethiopian highlands, based on a survey of 198 villages. We find that population growth has contributed significantly to land  degradation, poverty and food insecurity in this region. In contrast, better market access and some credit and technical assistance programs were associated with improvement (or less decline) in land quality, wealth and food security; suggesting the possibility of “win-win-win” development outcomes with appropriate interventions. Land redistribution was associated with adoption of inorganic fertilizer, but also with declining use of fallow and declining soil fertility. We find also that different land management practices are adopted where different livelihood strategies are pursued, suggesting the importance of considering livelihood strategies in technical assistance programs. Development strategies should be tailored to the different comparative advantages of different locations; no “one-size-fits-all” strategy will work everywhere.</descri>

  <title>Land, trees, and women</title>
  <subtit>evolution of land tenure institutions in Western Ghana and Sumatra</subtit>
  <descri>This research report examines three questions that are central to IFPRI research: How do property-rights institutions affect efficiency and equity? How are resources allocated within households? Why does this matter from a policy perspective? As part of a larger multicountry study on property rights to land and trees, this study focuses on the evolution  from customary land tenure with communal ownership toward individualized rights, and how this shift affects women and men differently.This study’s key contribution is its multilevel econometric analysis of efficiency and equity issues. Using a combination of community, village, and household surveys in Western Ghana and Sumatra, two areas with traditional matrilineal inheritance systems, the authors and their collaborators analyze the effectiveness of village-, household-, and parcel-level property-rights institutions and  arrangements.</descri>

  <title>Community natural resource management</title>
  <subtit>the case of woodlots in northern Ethiopia</subtit>
  <descri>This paper examines the nature of community management of woodlots and investigates the determinants of collective action and its effectiveness in managing woodlots, based on a survey of 100 villages in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. We find that collective management of woodlots generally functions well in Tigray. Despite limited current benefits received by community members, the woodlots contribute substantially to community wealth, increasing members’ willingness to provide collective effort to manage the woodlots. We find that benefits are greater and problems less on woodlots managed at the village level than those managed at a higher municipality level, and that the average intensity of management is greater on village-managed woodlots. Nevertheless, we find little evidence of differences in collective management of woodlots or its effectiveness on village vs. municipality-managed woodlots, after controlling for other factors. The factors that do significantly affect collective action include population density (higher collective labor input and lower planting density at intermediate than at low or high density), market access (less labor input, planting density and tree survival where market access is better), and presence of external organizations promoting the woodlot (reduces local effort to protect the woodlot and tree survival). The negative effect of market access suggests that higher opportunity costs of labor and/or increased “exit options” undermine collective resource management. The findings suggest collective action may be more beneficial and more effective when managed at a more local level, when the role of external organizations is more demand-driven, and when promoted in intermediate population density communities more remote from markets. In higher population density settings and areas closer to markets, private-oriented approaches are likely to be more effective.</descri>

  <title>Changes in intrahousehold labor allocation to environmental goods collection</title>
  <subtit>a case study from rural Nepal, 1982 to 1997</subtit>
  <descri>This study explores the impact of changes in environmental conditions on intrahousehold labor allocation to the collection of environmental goods such as fuelwood and leaf fodder for a sample of rural Nepali households. Using household-level panel data collected in 1982 and 1997, the study finds that household collection time significantly increases with measures of environmental resource scarcity, and that the increase appears to come almost equally from men and women. Additionally, the results of this study indicate that household collection burdens are significantly lower in 1997 than in 1982, and that women have seen the largest decrease in their time spent collecting. The picture is not an entirely rosy one, however, as consumption of environmental goods is also significantly lower in 1997 compared to 1982. The results taken together indicate that one should not hastily attribute decreases in collection labor burdens to successful forest rehabilitation in areas managed by forest user groups. In this case it appears that lower collection times are principally due to reduced consumption and increased collection from private land.</descri>

  <title>The role of trees for sustainable management of less-favored lands</title>
  <subtit>the case of eucalyptus in Ethiopia</subtit>
  <descri>In recent years the planting of eucalyptus trees in Ethiopia has expanded from State owned plantations to community woodlots and household compounds. In an environment suffering from severe woody biomass shortages water scarcity, erosion and land degradation, fast growing and resilient eucalyptus species perform better than most indigenous woodland and forest tree species (as well as most crops). In addition to increasing biomass and providing ground cover, the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has substantial potential to raise farm incomes, reduce poverty, increase food security and diversify smallholder-farming systems in less-favored areas of northern Ethiopia. Despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods in northern Ethiopia in 1997, the regional government of Tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands. The regional  government promotes planting of eucalyptus and other species in community woodlots, and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides. In this paper, we review the debate about the ecological impacts of eucalyptus trees, as well as the economic factors that influence whether smallholders invest in these trees. Ex ante benefit-cost analysis based on community level survey data from Tigray illustrates that under most conditions planting eucalyptus trees yields high rates of return, well above 20% under most circumstances. The effect of variable harvest rates, the costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on farmlands, and differences between administrative zones are considered relative to our base case in our rate of return estimates. The importance of fast growing tree species that can accommodate the high discount rates associated with smallholders in this region is emphasized.</descri>

  <title>The role of tenure in the management of trees at the community level</title>
  <subtit>theoretical and empirical analyses from Uganda and Malawi</subtit>
  <descri>This paper examines the effects of tenure on tree management at a community level. First, several important conceptual issues arising from this particular meso-level focus are discussed. Second, a description of the key tenure and tree management issues in Uganda and Malawi is presented. In each case, data representing changes in land use and tree cover between the 1960-70s and 1990s are analyzed. In both countries, there has been significant conversion of land from woodlands to agriculture. Tree cover has been more or less maintained over time in Uganda but has decreased in Malawi. Lastly, the paper explores the relationships between tenure and tree management using econometric techniques. Tenure is found to be linked to land-use and tree-cover change in both countries, though it is not necessarily the most important factor (e.g., population pressure is the key driving force for land-use change). In Uganda, conversion of land was more rapid under the customary tenure system and tree cover on nonagricultural land better maintained under the mailo system. In Malawi there was more rapid land-use conversion and tree cover depletion where there were more changes to traditional tenure systems taking place.</descri>

  <title>Strategies for sustainable agricultural development in the East African highlands</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Low agricultural productivity, land degradation and poverty are severe interrelated problems in the East African highlands. While the proximate causes of such problems are relatively well known, the underlying causes are many and complex, and depend upon many site-specific factors that vary greatly across the diverse circumstances of the region.  In this paper, we argue that the appropriate strategy for sustainable development depends greatly upon the “pathways of development” that are feasible in a given location. We argue that such development pathways will be largely determined by three factors determining comparative advantage: agricultural potential, access to markets, and population density.  We conclude the paper with hypotheses about the priorities for policy intervention to achieve sustainable development in the East African highlands. Among these, we suggest that the highest priority for road and irrigation development should be areas close to urban markets with high agricultural potential; that development of input and output markets and credit systems will be most critical in such areas; that increasing food security through increased food crop production or other means is likely to be a key to realizing the potential for more commercial production; that subsidies on the costs of transporting fertilizer to remote, high-potential, food deficit areas should be considered as a lower cost alternative to food aid; and that intensified and more private use of hillsides and grazing areas for sustainable uses such as tree planting may have potential to achieve more rapid and sustainable development of lower potential areas.</descri>

  <title>Property rights, collective action, and technologies for natural resource management</title>
  <subtit>exchange of knowledge and implications for policy</subtit>
  <descri>"Degradation of natural resources has become a global problem that threatens the livelihood of millions of poor people. Many promising technologies for natural resource management are available to address these problems, but farmers and others often fail to adopt them. Why is this? Although many factors can be identified, lack of secure property rights and collective action deserve greater attention from policy makers and technology developers. The authors discuss how property rights and collective action affect technology adoption; the factors influencing technology choices; implications for efficiency, equity and environmental sustainability; and, policy implications and areas for research." -- from Text</descri>

  <descri>La vie d'environ les deux tiers des Africains depend de leur agriculture. Le sort de la production agricole, par consequent, affecte directement la croissance economique, les progres sociaux et les echanges internationaux en Afrique. Comme la population continue de cro1tre rapidement, plus vite que dans d'autres regions du m~nde, ses terres agricoles se degradent de plus en plus. Les agriculteurs intensifient I'utilisation des terres pour repondre aux besoins en vivres mais sans pratiques de gestion appropriees ni apports exterieurs. L'epuisement qui en resulte des elements nutritifs dans les sols a ete la cause de la stagnation de la production agricole ou de sa baisse dans beaucoup de pays d'Afrique.</descri>

  <subtit>una amenaza para la seguridad alimentaria de los países en desarrollo en el año 2020?</subtit>
  <descri>Global population in the year 2020 will be a third higher than in 1995, but demand for food and fiber will rise by an even higher proportion, as incomes grow, diets diversify, and urbanization accelerates. However this demand is met, population and farming pressure on land resources will intensify greatly. There is growing concern in some quarters that a decline in long-term soil productivity is already seriously limiting food production in the developing world, and that the problem is getting worse. Sarah Sherr first focuses on the magnitude and effects of soil degradation. She then addresses soil degradation in the future and ends her brief with policy and research priorities.</descri>

  <title>Causes and consequences of changing land tenure institutions in Western Ghana</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Land tenure institutions in customary land areas of  Sub-Saharan Africa have been evolving towards individualized ownership. Communal land tenure institutions aim to achieve and preserve the equitable distribution of land (and hence, income) among community members. Uncultivated forestland is owned by the community or village, and as long as forest land is available, forest clearance of forest is easily approved by the village chief. Forest clearance is usually rewarded by relatively strong individual rights to land, which are further strengthened by long-term or permanent improvements in the land. Land rights, however, tend to become weaker if land is put into fallow over extended periods. In communal ownership systems, individual rights to transfer and inheritance are limited and controlled by leaders of the extended family. Thus, incentives to invest in land resources under such land tenure rules may be weaker due to unclear and uncertain individual rights....Changes in mode of land acquisition. Based on a survey of  60 villages in Western Ghana, where cocoa is the dominant crop, this study identifies statistically the determinants and the consequences of changing customary land tenure institutions....Under increasing population pressure, shifting cultivation becomes unsustainable since gradual decreases in the fallow period reduce soil fertility. Under such conditions, more labor-intensive and land-saving farming systems must be established. In Western Ghana, customary land tenure institutions have evolved toward individualized systems in order to provide appropriate incentives to invest in tree planting and  management.</descri>

  <title>Individualization of land rights and gender-differentiated inheritance in matrilineal Sumatra</title>
  <subtit>efficiency and equity implications</subtit>
  <descri>This paper examines the equity implications of the evolution of land rights from communal land tenure to individualization in customary land areas in Western Sumatra. This brief sets forth policy implications: Preference for sons in the inheritance of agroforestry area in the Low Region may be explained by the intensive use of male labor in rubber production; in contrast, both paddy cultivation and cinnamon cultivation in the Middle Region use both male and female family labor relatively equally. The inheritance system seems to be evolving from a strictly matrilineal system to a more egalitarian system in which sons and daughters inherit the type of land which is more intensive in their own work effort. That is, the newly-emerging customary land tenure institutions, by allowing for inheritance consistent with comparative advantage and work effort, seem to have built-in incentives for men and women. The persistent gender gap in schooling, however, needs to be addressed. Even if daughters continue to have independent land rights, lower levels of education make them less likely to benefit from nonagricultural income earning opportunities...Investing in the education of both sons and daughters would thus be part of a long-term solution to rural poverty and environmental sustainability in these areas.</descri>

  <title>Women's land rights in the transition to individualized ownership</title>
  <subtit>implications for tree resource management in Western Ghana</subtit>
  <descri>Based on a survey of 60 villages in Western Ghana, where cocoa is the dominant crop, this study explores evolutionary changes in land tenure institutions on women's land rights and the efficiency of tree resource management....With increasing population pressure, customary land tenure institutions in Western Ghana have evolved toward individualized systems in order to provide appropriate incentives to invest in tree planting and management. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, individualization of land rights has strengthened women’s rights to land. If labor-intensive agriculture increases the demand for female labor, as in the case of cocoa in Ghana, a woman's labor on her husband's plot may represent a form of sweat equity that confers individualized land rights to her."</descri>

  <title>Land tenure and farm management efficiency</title>
  <subtit>the case of paddy and cinnamon production in customary land areas of Sumatra</subtit>
  <descri>This study attempts to identify the impacts of land tenure institutions on the efficiency of  farm management based on a case study of paddy rice and upland cinnamon production in the Kerinci Valley in West Sumatra, where most of Indonesia’s  cinnamon is produced. The attractiveness of cinnamon as a commercial crop has implications for forest preservation. Kerinci Valley is an enclave surrounded by the Kerinci Seblat National Park, one of the largest parks in Sumatra. The highest plant biodiversity richness measured to date anywhere in the world recently was recorded in areas surrounding this park. Expansion of cinnamon area by clearing forest land therefore occurs at the expense of forest conservation.The brief concludes that, in sum, the evolution of customary tenure institutions and factor markets seems effective in achieving a financially efficient allocation of resources in the short run and accumulation of investments in agroforestry trees over time. At present, property rights in land (and trees) are well recognized and respected among community members, so that there does not seem to be much room for improving investment incentives by strengthening individual rights within these indigenous societies. However, in the long run, a land titling program may be necessary to further enhance management efficiency.</descri>

  <title>Population, land tenure, and natural resource management</title>
  <subtit>the case of customary land area in Malawi</subtit>
  <descri>This paper uses cross section-time series data on 57 communities in Malawi to determine statistically the factors determining changes in land use, tree cover, and crop yield. The econometric model is developed from a theoretical model which also endogenizes population growth and prevailing land tenure institutions within the customary sector of Malawi. The analysis reflects changes between 1971 and 1995, utilizing aerial photos taken at these dates and complementing these with field surveys. The data show a deterioration of Malawi's natural resource base: declining yields, loss of tree cover, and near exhaustion of land for agricultural expansion. Key findings are that population pressure induces land conversion but not yield or tree cover change; the matrilocal system of household residence is negatively associated with tree cover but induces agricultural conversion; and there is some improvement in management of resources as their scarcity increases. Policy recommendations include greater focus on agroforestry to increase tree cover as woodland areas are poorly managed, and increased effort to improve market integration since this benefits crop yields without adverse effects on tree cover.</descri>

  <title>Population pressure, land tenure, and tree resource management in Uganda</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>This study uses aerial photographs and survey data from sixty four parishes in east-central Uganda to identify the factors affecting conversion of woodlands and traditional grazing areas to agriculture. Regression analysis shows that customary land tenure institutions, greater population pressure and poor access to markets are significant causes of land conversion to agriculture, and hence to loss of trees. Private ownership of converted land promotes greater integration of trees and crops and leads to the highest density of trees on agricultural land. Given that continuing population growth will lead to further land conversion to agriculture, the best prospect for maintaining or increasing tree populations lies with agroforestry on cultivated land.</descri>

  <title>Changing fish trade and demand patterns in developing countries and their significance for policy research</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Trends for major fisheries products are evaluated for the past two decades, using aggregate annual data. Major changes have been propelled by income growth, changes in preferences and health concerns about meat in developed countries, leading to increased consumption of high-valued fisheries items such as shell and filet fish. Developing countries, especially East Asia, are rapidly increasing consumption of lower valued fishery items, and fish-culture is becoming an increasingly important source of food and exports. Developed countries accounted for 85 percent of net world fish imports in 1994, mostly at the high end of the value spectrum, from about twenty countries. In the ten years preceding 1993, the net value of fisheries exports from developing countries went from less than a third of net developing country exports of sugar, beverage crops and tropical specialty products combined, to a level exceeding that total. While real fish prices have remained relatively stable since 1970, real beef prices have declined by 300 percent, suggesting that a rally in meat prices would further accentuate the shift to fish. Current evidence suggests a 15 percent relative strengthening of fish prices to beef through 2020.</descri>

  <title>Land degradation in the developing world</title>
  <subtit>implications for food, agriculture, and the environment to 2020.</subtit>
  <descri>By the year 2020 land degradation may pose a serious threat to food production and rural livelihoods, particularly in poor and densely populated areas of the developing world. Appropriate policies are required to encourage land-improving investments and better land management if developing countries are to sustainably meet the food needs of their populations. The authors investigate the impact of land degradation on global agricultural production.However, land degradation could have dramatic effects in specific countries and subregions in the form of  (1) Nutrient depletion; (2) Salinization; (3) Agrochemical pollution; (4) Soil erosion; (5) Vegetative degradation of rangelands and ; (6) Agriculture-induced deforestation by 2020. The brief identifies strategies to reduce land degradation. and makes policy recommendations.</descri>

  <title>Policies and markets for non-timber tree products</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Markets for non-timber tree products (NTTPs) are widely viewed with great promise because of their potential for achieving a range of development objectives. Markets can, of course, be influenced by policy, but in order to do so, market information is needed to better inform the policy process. There has been increasing concern that few market studies have been adequate for doing so. There has been ambivalence at the policy level because these markets are highly diverse and difficult to characterize, and because governments tend to view NTTP markets as a threat to the conservation and management of forests and woodlands. Perhaps most importantly, however, there has been a failure to link the design of market studies with the potential for policy change. We argue in this paper that policies per se can be used to influence the operation of these markets, and that good market research should be more carefully designed to reflect explicit policy objectives.</descri>

  <title>The transition in the contribution of living aquatic resources to food security</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>The fishing industry's aggressive and expanding search for fish from the sea reached a turning point in 1990. After many years of increasing production, the global marine and inland catch from natural stocks declined from the 1989 peak of about 89 million tons to 85 million tons in 1993. Aquaculture production did not increase enough to meet the shortfall, and total production also fell in 1990 and 199.  Present indications are that production from natural stocks will be below the current level in the year 2020; at best, it will maintain its present level. The author addresses five major issues: (1) maximizing the use of aquatic resources; (2) resource management; (3) intensification of fisheries exploitation; (4)   integration of fisheries and aquaculture; and (5) the difficult problem of balancing national versus international interests.</descri>

  <title>A 2020 Vision for food, agriculture, and the environment in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
  <subtit>a synthesis</subtit>
  <descri>The workshop participants were clear that now is the time for choices, and that without the will to make those choices, the likelihood of success in boosting agricultural growth on a sustained basis would be small. Without such growth, it will not be possible to improve food security or halt natural resource degradation. It seems unlikely that all countries of Africa will choose to put in place the necessary conditions for growth, which makes it all the more important to decide at the outset which conditions are most likely to beget further success. Participants highlighted four principal conditions that are interrelated: greater stability, probity, consistency, and analytical quality in the policymaking process for agriculture; increased public investment by national governments to facilitate growth in the agriculture sector; proactive adaptation to changing global trade conditions; and inclusion of the poor and malnourished in growth.</descri>

  <title>Agricultural commercialization, economic development, and nutrition</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>A large body of literature makes the argument that commercialization of agriculture has mainly negative effects on the employment, incomes, food production and consumption, health, and nutrition of the poor. In Commercialization of Agriculture, Economic Development, and Nutrition, Joachim von Braun and Eileen Kennedy find that the conclusion that commercialization of agriculture is generally bad for nutrition is flawed. This conclusion, emerging from a mix of historical, real, and ideological factors as well as methodologically faulty analysis, has continually been questioned by policymakers in developing countries as well as aid agencies and non-governmental organizations.</descri>

  <title>Confronting the environmental consequences of the Green Revolution in Asia</title>
  <subtit></subtit>
  <descri>Intensive double or triple monocropping of rice has caused degradation of the paddy micro environment and reductions in rice yield growth in many irrigated areas in Asia. Problems include increased pest infestation, mining of soil micronutrients, reductions in nutrient-carrying capacity of the soil, build-up of soil toxicity, and salinity and waterlogging. Emerging sustainability problems in intensive rice agriculture show the need for a greater understanding of the physical, biological and ecological consequences of agricultural intensification and greater research attention to long term management of the agricultural resource base.</descri>

  <title>Priorities for forestry and agroforestry policy research</title>
  <subtit>report of an international workshop.</subtit>
  <descri>Recent intemational reviews of forestry and agroforestry research needs in developing areas (such as Bellagio II and the study conducted by the Technical Advisory Committee of the Consultative Group on Intemational Agricultural Research [CGIAR)) have placed high priority on policy research, both because of the basic importance of policy constraints in the overall course of forestry development and conservation and because of the existing lack of research in this area. In order to better identify priority issues for policy research, the Intemational Union of Forestry Research Organizations, Special Program for Developing Countries (IUFRO/SPDC), the Intemational Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) , and the Agency for Intemational Development (AID), in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Forestry For Sustainable Development Program at the University of Minnesota, convened an intemational workshop on forestry and agroforestry policy research in Washington, D.C., July 9-12, 1991. It was hosted by IFPRI.</descri>
