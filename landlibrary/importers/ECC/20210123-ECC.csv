"ECC:26240";"UK Food Security and Climate Change";;"<p><em><strong>This primer explains the current situation concerning the United Kingdom’s food supply and how this is likely to change in the medium and long term as a result of climate change. It discusses likely threats to UK food security emerging from a range of potential warming scenarios and the current policy debate on how to address them effectively.</strong></em></p>
<p>Acute food insecurity has been in the news as the UK heads towards a post-EU rupture with the European Common Market but there is also a chronic threat to UK food security posed by climate change and disruption. The most prominent discussions concerning the potential security implications of a changing climate tend to focus on its potential to exacerbate international conflict (its role as a threat multiplier), the challenges it poses to international development efforts, and the ways in which it could limit or complicate military operations.</p>
<p>The direct threat climate change poses to the UK itself has not received enough attention, nor the domestic threat to the UK of climatic impacts on international supply chains, upon which it is highly dependent. This is doubly perverse. On the one hand, in terms of evidence, academic analysis of how a warming world will affect fragile, interconnected and interdependent human systems becomes more sure-footed and confident as it “zooms in” from the global level to smaller regional and sub-regional units of analysis. On the other, from the standpoint of UK national security planners, direct impacts on the home islands and British citizens are of paramount importance.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Points</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently 50% by value of all food consumed in the UK is imported. 60% of this is from the EU, with a heavy concentration on suppliers in Spain and the Netherlands.</li>
<li>Securing greater diversity of international suppliers has been identified as a priority by the UK Government, particularly in the context of Brexit.</li>
<li>UK food supply chains currently have limited direct exposure to the closure of global supply choke-points; however, this may change should the pursuit of diversification of imports away from western European suppliers succeed.</li>
<li>Regardless, the UK is as exposed as the rest of the world to food price volatility and potential long-term food price inflation. A changing climate is likely to reduce the amount of arable land available in the UK and make international disruptions more likely.</li>
<li>The UK Government has rejected the advice of the Independent Committee on Climate Change to adopt more proactive measures to manage food price volatility, choosing to pursue this policy goal through diplomacy within the G-20.</li>
<li>There is a geopolitical dimension to the intergovernmental management of food supplies in a context of global food scarcity. Developing world food exporters, including within the G20, that have contributed relatively little to climate change may be less inclined to cooperate with the UK.</li>

In 2017, the number of people affected by acute food insecurity increased by 11 million. These are the main findings of a publication titled, “Global Report on Food Crises,” released by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). </strong></em></p><p>The report states that conflict and climate change-related disasters were the main drivers of acute food insecurity in 18 countries where 74 million people need urgent assistance to prevent famine. New or intensified conflict has deteriorated food security in Myanmar, north-east Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Yemen. Prolonged drought conditions have aggravated the situation in several countries in eastern and southern Africa.</p><p>The report further notes that conflict will continue to be a main driver of food insecurity in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, north-eastern Nigeria, the Lake Chad region, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Mali and Niger. It also warns that continued dry weather conditions will further impact food security in pastoral areas of Somalia, south-eastern Ethiopia and eastern Kenya, and in West African and Sahel countries including Senegal, Chad, Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso.</p><p>FSIN, also known as the Global Network against Food Crises, is a joint initiative of the EU, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP). Through the Global Report on Food Crises, the group aims to provide a comprehensive overview of acute food insecurity based on evidence and data from multiple national and regional sources.

"ECC:25898";"The 10 Science ‘Must Knows’ on Climate Change";;"<p><em><strong>It is undoubtedly a challenge for climate policy actors to identify reliable evidence to support sound decision-making processes for tackling climate issues effectively. Still, differentiating between fact and fiction, well-designed and invalid science, evidence- or interest-based arguments is precisely what determines the quality of climate policies. </strong></em></p>
<p>While selecting trustworthy sources from a seemingly endless mass of information might seem an impossible task, one thing can and should be done: defining indisputable climate facts. A handful of climatic issues enjoy extensive testing and research, and their conclusions are as reliable as it can be. Yet, decision-makers spend precious resources debating the verity of these climatic issues, resources that could be applied to furthering climate action.</p>
<p>In this short paper, the <a href=""http://www.the-earth-league.org/"" target=""_blank"">Earth League</a> and <a href=""http://www.futureearth.org/"" target=""_blank"">Future Earth</a> unravel 10 scientific facts on climate change that should be recognized by those pursuing the goals set by the Paris Agreement, while proposing policies to achieve them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence shows that Earth has entered a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene – with profound implications for humanity and the relative stability of the Earth system. </strong></li>
<li><strong> Earth is approaching tipping points due to human pressures. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Risks of extreme weather are increasing. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Rising sea levels and ocean acidification are growing threats. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The costs of climate change are already being felt today and will increase in the future. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Human health is at risk from air pollutants that alter the climate, and the impacts of a changing climate, which are decreasing food security and increasing the risks of disease and heat stress. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Climate change is likely to exacerbate the risk of large-scale migration and civil unrest. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The world needs to act faster: deeper cuts are needed to reduce risk of global average temperature rising 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. A pathway of halving global emissions every decade is consistent with this goal. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Analyses suggest that it is possible for the world to meet Paris Agreement targets if nation states cooperate and coordinate mitigation efforts. Carbon pricing is an important policy tool that would create substantial revenues amounting to potentially several percent of GDP.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adaptation and resilience building are necessary even if the world succeeds with aggressive international action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  </strong></li>

It summarizes the key challenges the Lake Chad region is experiencing as a consequence of the interplay between climate change and fragility.</strong></em></p><p>Climate change increasingly threatens the stability of states and societies. In the context of global security, it is best understood as a ‘threat multiplier’ that interacts with and compounds existing risks and pressures. When climate change converges and interacts with other environmental, economic, social, and political shocks and pressures, it can increase the likelihood of instability or conflict. This threat is particularly virulent in fragile and conflict-affected situations where governments and societal institutions already struggle to achieve security and equitable development. At the same time, conflicts and fragility often contribute to environmental degradation and undermine the ability to adapt to climate change, thus creating a vicious circle of increasing vulnerability and fragility. The complex and systemic risks that arise out of the interaction between climate change and other environmental, economic, social, and political pressures are what this profile calls climate-fragility risks.</p><p>This Climate-Fragility profile is envisaged as a first component of a Climate-Fragility Risk Assessment process – a process for actors working in contexts affected by climate and fragility risks to understand the linked nature of these risks and plan, design, implement and evaluate programmes to respond positively to these risks.

It projects that without concrete climate and development action, just over 143 million people—or around 2.8 percent of the population of these three regions—could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. They will migrate from less viable areas with lower water availability and crop productivity and from areas affected by rising sea level and storm surges.</p><p>The poorest and most climate vulnerable areas will be hardest hit. These trends, alongside the emergence of “hotspots” of climate in- and out-migration, will have major implications for climate-sensitive sectors and for the adequacy of infrastructure and social support systems.

"ECC:25801";"The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction as a Tool for Conflict Prevention";;"<p><em><strong>The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) is a non-legally binding agreement designed to reduce existing levels of risk and prevent emerging risks. While references to conflict were deleted from the final text, Sendai addresses issues parallel to those that would need to be addressed in a prevention and sustaining peace agenda. </strong></em></p><p>The Framework, if properly implemented, would tackle three sets of factors that increase both disaster and conflict risks:</p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">1. </span><strong><em>Socio-economic factors.</em></strong> The Framework aims to reduce vulnerabilities and prevent risks through action that tackles the underlying disaster and conflict risk drivers, such as the consequences of poverty, inequality, and marginalization. The Framework argues for a broader and more people-centered prevention approach to disaster risk reduction and calls for closer engagement with relevant stakeholders.</p><p>2.<strong><em> Politico-institutional factors. </em></strong>The Framework highlights the need for good governance in disaster risk reduction at the local, national, regional and global level. By working with national and local actors to help design DRR strategies that prevent the creation of risk and reduce existing ones, Sendai increases economic, social, health and environmental resilience, which is crucial to any prevention and sustaining peace strategy.</p><p>3.<strong><em> Environmental factors. </em></strong>The Framework calls for policy planning and preparation that not only considers the impact of climate change but also considers possible scenarios to help anticipate risks and mitigate them. Through a lens of prevention, preparedness, and resilience, the implementation of the Sendai Framework can lower existing climate-related risks.</p><p>The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction addresses a diversity of factors that put populations at risk of disaster and conflict. Sendai’s focus on inclusive and participatory capacity building at the local, regional, national and global level that involves a diversity of stakeholders mirrors the debate centered on prevention taking place within the broader UN system. Many of the recommendations from the 2015 and 2016 reviews, including the need for system-cohesiveness and inclusion of a diversity of actors, the need for people-centered approaches to prevention, and the primacy of local and national actors in prevention align with the goals delineated within the Sendai Framework.</p><p>A prevention-driven United Nations will require creative and innovative solutions that force the system to break away from its bureaucratic and institutional silos. Considering DRR in general and the Sendai Framework specifically as a prevention tool incorporates into the prevention and sustaining peace discussions a sector of the UN that has historically operated independent and in isolation of the work of more prominent UN agencies. For the UN to work horizontally as ""one UN"" requires bridging these two agendas, as the drivers of conflict sit squarely with the risks of disaster. Multidimensional approaches to prevention that include a DRR lens would address the underlying causes of conflict and disaster-risk. The Sendai Framework sets out a roadmap on how this can be achieved.</p><p><em>[This description was extracted from <a href=""https://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/the-sendai-framework-for-disaster-risk-reduction-as-a-tool-for-conflict-prevention/"" target=""_blank"">ssrc.org</a>]</em></p>";"Sabrina Stein and Colin Walch";;;"Environment, Conflict and Cooperation Platform";"2017-08-11";"en";"assessment;conflicts;food security;land governance;tenure security";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security;Land Conflicts;Land in Post-Conflict Settings";"001";;"https://library.ecc-platform.org/publications/sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-tool-conflict-prevention";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/3023/download?token=Q98i0Ugl";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/sites/default/files/SENDAI%20framework%20disaster%20risk%20reduction.png";;;;"Conflict Transformation;Early Warning & Risk Analysis;Land & Food;Security";

Yet it is difficult to get an overall, national-level understanding of where the impact of climate change on food security and livelihoods are most worrying and need to be addressed most urgently.</p><p>This report focuses not on “where have droughts or floods become more frequent and severe?”, but rather “where has the impact of droughts and floods on livelihoods—and ultimately food security—been most severe?” To answer this question, climate information was combined with detailed livelihood zoning and hazard analysis to obtain an overview of which areas and population groups are most vulnerable to climate change. The report also describes future risks under a changing climate.</p><p><em>[<a href=""https://www.weadapt.org/placemarks/maps/view/27871"" target=""_blank"">...continue reading on the original site</a>]</em></p>";;"Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan;United Nations Environment Programme;World Food Programme";;"Environment, Conflict and Cooperation Platform";"2017-07-27";"en";"biodiversity;climate change;food security;land governance";"Land & Food Security;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"142";;"https://library.ecc-platform.org/publications/climate-change-afghanistan-what-does-it-mean-rural-livelihoods-and-food-security";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/2996/download?token=zQTUfdXe";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/sites/default/files/Climate%20Change%20in%20Afghanistan.png";;;;"Biodiversity & Livelihoods;Climate Change;Land & Food";

<p><span><span lang=""EN"" xml:lang=""EN""><span><span><span>The analysis, largely based on modelling, illustrates that pressure on the production of food in already vulnerable areas will increase if current trends were to continue. However, improved water management could increase agricultural production by over 40%, in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, among other areas. Population numbers in flood-prone areas will increase, from over 1 billion to around 1.6 billion. The pollution of rivers and coastal areas is expected to increase, particularly due to the projected doubling of the amount of untreated wastewater being discharged from rapidly growing cities in developing countries. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

"ECC:26502";"IPCC Special Report: Climate Change and Land";;"<p><em><strong>Land is already under growing human pressure and climate change is adding to these pressures. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land, launched by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on 8 August 2019, looks into land resources as critical for the climate, and highlights the importance of sound land management for addressing climate change. The report will be a key scientific input into forthcoming climate and environment negotiations.</strong></em></p>
<p>This report shows that better land management can contribute to tackling climate change, but is not the only solution. Land must remain productive to maintain food security as the population increases and the negative impacts of climate change on vegetation increase. This means there are limits to the contribution of land to addressing climate change, for instance through the cultivation of energy crops and afforestation.</p>
<h3>Main points:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land is a critical resource</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Climate Change and Land </em>finds that the world is best placed to tackle climate change when there is an overall focus on sustainability. “Land plays an important role in the climate system,” said Jim Skea, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III. “Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time natural land processes absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to almost a third of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry,” he said.</p>
<p>The report shows how managing land resources sustainably can help address climate change, said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II. “Land already in use could feed the world in a changing climate and provide biomass for renewable energy, but early, far-reaching action across several areas is required” he said.  “Also for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Desertification and land degradation</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class=""Colorbox"" href=""https://www.climate-diplomacy.org/news/explainer-%E2%80%98desertification%E2%80%99-and-role-climate-change"" target=""_blank"">When land is degraded, it becomes less productive</a>, restricting what can be grown and reducing the soil’s ability to absorb carbon. This exacerbates climate change, while climate change in turn exacerbates land degradation in many different ways.</p>
<p>Roughly 500 million people live in areas that experience desertification. Drylands and areas that experience desertification are also more vulnerable to climate change and extreme events including drought, heatwaves, and dust storms, with an increasing global population providing further pressure.</p>
<p>The report sets out options to tackle land degradation, and prevent or adapt to further climate change. It also examines potential impacts from different levels of global warming.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Food security</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Coordinated action to address climate change can simultaneously improve land, food security and nutrition, and help to end hunger.  The report highlights that climate change is affecting all four pillars of food security: availability (yield and production), access (prices and ability to obtain food), utilization (nutrition and cooking), and stability (disruptions to availability).</p>
<p>The report records that about one third of food produced is lost or wasted. Causes of food loss and waste differ substantially between developed and developing countries, as well as between regions. Reducing this loss and waste would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve food security.</p>
<p>An overall focus on sustainability coupled with early action offers the best chances to tackle climate change. This would entail low population growth and reduced inequalities, improved nutrition and lower food waste.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land and climate change responses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Policies that are outside the land and energy domains, such as on transport and environment , can also make a critical difference to tackling climate change. Acting early is more cost-effective as it avoids losses.</p>
<p>“There are things we are already doing. We are using technologies and good practices, but they do need to be scaled up and used in other suitable places that they are not being used in now,” said Panmao Zhai, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I.</p>
<p>“There is real potential here through more sustainable land use, reducing over-consumption and waste of food, eliminating the clearing and burning of forests, preventing over-harvesting of fuelwood, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus helping to address land related climate change issues,” he said.</p>

"ECC:25629";"Counting the Cost: Agriculture in Syria after six years of crisis";;"<p>Despite six years of crisis in Syria, agriculture remains a key part of the economy. The sector still accounts for an estimated 26 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and represents a critical safety net for the 6.7 million Syrians – including those internally displaced - who still remain in rural areas. However, agriculture and the livelihoods that depend on it have suffered massive loss. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has now conducted the first comprehensive nationwide assessment on the cost of the war to the agriculture sector. The assessment interviewed more than 3 500 households and conducted focus groups in´over 380 communities to establish the impact and get a clearer understanding of the type of support required to kick-start the recovery.</p><p>[Adopted from fao.org]</p><p>For additional information, see our <a href=""https://factbook.ecc-platform.org/conflicts/syrian-civil-war-role-climate-change"">factbook article</a> on the crisis in Syria.</p>";;"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";;"Environment, Conflict and Cooperation Platform";"2017-04-13";"en";"biodiversity;climate change;food security;land governance;public participation";"Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"015;145";;"https://library.ecc-platform.org/publications/counting-cost-agriculture-syria-after-six-years-crisis";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/2775/download?token=O6NX9AKK";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/sites/default/files/FAO%20%282017%29%20Counting%20the%20cost%20-%20Agriculture%20in%20Syria.png";;;;"Biodiversity & Livelihoods;Civil Society;Climate Change;Land & Food";

"ECC:25662";"At the root of exodus: Food security, conflict and international migration";;"<p>As an international actor in addressing food insecurity among refugees and other migrants, the World  Food Programme (WFP) has undertaken a research study to determine the role that food security plays in cross-border migration. Given the dearth of data on this topic, the WFP  study sought to answer some of the following questions: What is it that compels people to leave their homes? What role does food insecurity play in migration? Are these factors common across all international migrants, or do unique root causes spur specific migrant populations to move from their homes?</p><p>The study employed quantitative and qualitative research methods. WFP convened focus group discussions with migrants from ten different countries in Greece, Italy, Jordan,  Turkey and Lebanon. Such discussions provided first-hand accounts regarding the decision-making process to leave, and provided valuable information on the situation in countries of origin, the triggers for migration, routes taken and future intentions. In an effort to validate the data collected from focus group discussions, WFP carried out  household phone surveys among refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.</p><p>Participants in the study included migrants from East Africa, West Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the largest number of respondents originating from Afghanistan,  Bangladesh, Iraq, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Syria and The Gambia.</p><p><em>[Abstract from the original text.]</em></p>";;"World Food Programme";;"Environment, Conflict and Cooperation Platform";"2017-05-09";"en";"environment;food security;land governance";"Land & Food Security;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"015;145;150";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/publications/root-exodus-food-security-conflict-and-international-migration";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/2821/download?token=FLCmPJ0N";"https://library.ecc-platform.org/sites/default/files/2017-05-11%20WFP_At%20the%20root%20of%20Exodus.png";;;;"Environment & Migration;Land & Food";
