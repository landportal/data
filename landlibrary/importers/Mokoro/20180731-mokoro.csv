mokoro:6059;Secure and equitable land rights in the Post-2015 Agenda – A key issue in the future we want;"As organizations working on food security, natural resources management and poverty eradication, we strongly encourage governments to keep the profile of land and natural resources high in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda document to be endorsed in September 2015. Secure and equitable land rights are an essential element of an Agenda that has the ambition to be people-centred and planet-sensitive. Recommendations cover indigenous peoples and local communities; free, prior and informed consent; women’s land rights; land rights in cities and urban settlements; rights to land and natural resources must be secure.";http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/G03892.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/secure-and-equitable-land-rights-in-the-post-2015-agenda-a-key-issue-in-the-future-we-want/;31-01-2015;;"ActionAid;International Institute for Environment and Development";"ActionAid;International Institute for Environment and Development";;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;food security;sustainable development;natural resources management;land rights;poverty;indigenous peoples;women";"Land & Gender;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5575;Cultivating Women’s Rights for Access to Land;Country analysis and recommendations for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Viet Nam. Analyzes the de jure and customary discriminations faced by women in terms of land access in these 10 countries. Each country study starts with a data box, followed by a Rural Women Profile, a summary of women’s constitutional rights and the national legislation, an examination of customary systems in place, identification of the main constraints to women’s access to land, a set of recommendations, and the status of ratifications of relevant major international treaties. Hopes to provide a base from which future work to give women a stronger voice in household, local and national decisions should be formulated. Need to begin work at the bottom by giving women a voice for expressing their needs and hopes in terms of land.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/cultivating_womens_rights_for_access_to_lans.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/cultivating-womens-rights-for-access-to-land/;31-10-2005;;"ActionAid;International Food Security Network";"ActionAid;International Food Security Network";;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land access;women";Land & Gender;Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:6064;Guiding Principles on Large Scale Land Based Investments in Africa;These Principles were officially launched on 12 November during the Inaugural Land Policy Conference in Africa in Addis Ababa. They aim to facilitate national land policy development and implementation process and to improve the governance of large-scale land based investments. They are articulated as fundamental principles based on human rights of communities, responsible governance of land, social acceptance by affected communities, gender equality and women’s access to land ownership, cost-benefits study and mutual accountability. They are also aligned to national strategies for sustainable agriculture. The challenge is their adoption and operationalization by AU member States. But Joan Kagwanja, Chief of the Land Policy Initiative, believes that African countries are ready to take the challenge. ‘We have already launched a series of training to build capacity of leaders, parliamentarians, jurists and other practitioners specializing in land issues. We hope that within the next three years at least, we will be able to stop land grabs. And that over the next decade, land management will have seen much needed improvement.’;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/guiding_principles_eng_rev_era_size.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/guiding-principles-on-large-scale-land-based-investments-in-africa/;30-11-2014;;"African Union;African Development Bank;United Nations Economic Commission for Africa";"African Union;African Development Bank;United Nations Economic Commission for Africa";;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;scale;land management;land grabs;agriculture;land ownership;women";Land & Gender;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:6060;Land and Seed Laws under Attack. Who is pushing changes in Africa?;The lobby to industrialise food production in Africa is changing seed and land laws across the continent to serve agribusiness corporations.

This survey aims to provide an overview of just who is pushing for which specific changes in these areas – looking not at the plans and projects, but at the actual texts that will define the new rules.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/grain-5121-land-and-seed-laws-under-attack-who-is-pushing-changes-in-africa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-and-seed-laws-under-attack-who-is-pushing-changes-in-africa/;31-01-2015;;"Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa;GRAIN";"Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa;GRAIN";;en;Reports & Research;002;"area;land;land law;commons;farmers";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment"
mokoro:8799;Land Audit: A Transactions Approach;A land audit responding to the facts that policy formulation around the very sensitive and complex issue of land has been based on perception rather than fact for too long and that no reliable figures on land ownership in South Africa exist. Acknowledges that there are still some gaps in the data, but presents statistics that  shed light on ownership patterns of agricultural land in South Africa. Required a multi-pronged approach. The amount of agricultural land has decreased from approximately 79.3% in 1994 to 76.3% in 2016. Land ownership by Previously Disadvantaged Individuals has increased significantly from 14.9% in 1994 to 29.1% in 2016. The setting of government targets on land reform has created expectations but there was no way to measure whether these targets were being achieved as no comprehensive land audit was done. This audit should provide a foundation.;https://www.agrisa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AgriSA_Land-Audit_November-2017.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-audit-transactions-approach/;30-11-2017;;;;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land ownership;land reform";;

mokoro:5480;Mortgaging the Future: The World Bank’s Land Agenda in Africa;Analyses the World Bank’s Policy Research Report (PRR) from a gender perspective and is critical of the consultation process on it thus far. It has important implications for women in Africa. The Bank believes land should be viewed not as a source of subsistence but of capital. It ignores women’s unpaid labour as a factor in agricultural productivity. It treats the household as an undifferentiated unit and ignores that the family often functions as a site of oppression. The Bank stresses ‘motivated’ family labour but ignores that much of women’s labour is far from voluntary. It also ignores the consequences for households of defaulting on loans using land as collateral and the real possibility that rural farmers may find themselves landless as a result. Issues of labour and capital are now of central importance to land relations in Africa.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/mortgaging_future_wb_in_africa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/mortgaging-the-future-the-world-banks-land-agenda-in-africa/;30-11-2002;;University of Warwick;University of Warwick;Ambreena Manji;en;Reports & Research;002;"women;land;farmers;research";Land & Gender;

mokoro:5632;Commercial Farmers and the State: Interest Group Politics and Land Reform in Zimbabwe;Original new thesis which explores the history and politics of commercial farmers in Zimbabwe, their interactions with the state, and their contests for land and other resources. Using fresh archive and key informant sources, it provides a unique perspective on Zimbabwe’s much publicised land and race debates. Argues that the dismantling of the white farming sector disguised wider political contest and provided a source of land and assets for the ruling ZANU PF with which to placate its elaborate and increasingly militarised patronage system.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/commercial_farmers_and_the_state_selby_thesis.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/commercial-farmers-and-the-state-interest-group-politics-and-land-reform-in-zimbabwe/;31-08-2006;;University of Oxford;University of Oxford;Angus Selby;en;Reports & Research;"002;ZWE";"land reform;land;farmers";;

mokoro:5499;Discourses on Women’s Land Rights in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Implications of the Re-turn to the Customary;Examines some contemporary policy discourses on land tenure reform in sub-Saharan Africa and their implications for women’s interests in land. Demonstrates an emerging consensus among a range of influential policy institutions (including the World Bank, IIED and Oxfam GB), lawyers and academics about the potential of so-called customary systems of land tenure to meet the needs of all land users and claimants. African women lawyers are much more equivocal about trusting the customary, preferring to look to the State for laws to protect women’s interests. There are considerable problems with so-called customary systems of land tenure and administration for achieving gender justice with respect to women’s land claims. Insufficient attention is being paid to power relations in the countryside and their implications for social groups, such as women, who are not well positioned and represented in local level power structures. Considerable changes will be needed before African states can begin to deliver gender justice with respect to land.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/return_to_the_customary.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/discourses-on-womens-land-rights-in-sub-saharan-africa-the-implications-of-the-re-turn-to-the-customary/;30-06-2003;Journal of Agrarian Change;Journal of Agrarian Change;;"Ann Whitehead;Dzodzi Tsikata";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land use;land tenure;land rights;trust;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
mokoro:8139;Water is Life: Women’s human rights in national and local water governance in Southern and Eastern Africa;"This book approaches water and sanitation as an African gender and human rights issue. Empirical case studies from Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe show how coexisting international, national and local regulations of water and sanitation respond to the ways in which different groups of rural and urban women gain access to water for personal, domestic and livelihood purposes. Explores how women cope in contexts where they lack secure rights, and participation in water governance institutions, formal and informal. Shows how women – as producers of family food – rely on water from multiple sources that are governed by community based norms and institutions which recognize the right to water for livelihood. How these ‘common pool water resources’ are threatened by large-scale development and commercialization initiatives is a key concern. Demonstrates that existing water governance structures lack mechanisms which make them accountable to poor and vulnerable waters users on the ground, most importantly women. Underscores the need to intensify measures to hold states accountable, not just in water services provision, but in assuring the basic human right to clean drinking water and sanitation; and also to protect water for livelihoods.";https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/50168;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/water-life-womens-human-rights-national-local-water-governance-southern-eastern-africa/;31-12-2015;;Weaver Press;;"Anne Hellum;Patricia Kameri;Barbara van Koppen";en;Reports & Research;002;"scale;women";Land & Gender;Land Use, Management & Investment

Divided into land justice and family justice and concludes by defining strategic interventions for the Justice, Law and Order Sector.

Argues that in a context of increasing land scarcity, high population pressure and progressing land tenure privatization, men are increasingly taking advantage of their superior position within the patrilineal tenure system, advancing their own interests at the expense of weaker family members, first and foremost the women in the family.

Argues that the most appropriate approach to tenure reform is to make socially legitimate occupation and use rights the point of departure for both their recognition in law and for the design of institutional contexts for mediating competing claims and administering land. Legal frameworks should vest land rights in the people who occupy and use land, not in groups or institutions, while recognising that these rights are shared and relative within a variety of nested social units.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/African_land_rights_distinctiveness.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/more-than-simply-socially-embedded-recognizing-the-distinctiveness-of-african-land-rights/;31-05-2006;;;;"Ben Cousins;Aninka Claassens";en;Reports & Research;002;"occupation;use rights;land rights;land tenure;land";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Looks both at livelihood trajectories and outcomes in the resettlement areas and at selected contrasts between the communities of origin and the new communities. Set in a context characterized by recurring drought, policy shifts, declining public sector support, long-term demographic shifts, and the rising toll of HIV and AIDS.

mokoro:5485;From a Gender Perspective: Notions of Land Tenure Security in the Uluguru Mountains, Tanzania;Gives a brief overview on how the gender debate featured in the process of land reform in Tanzania and asks why socio-economic arguments have to be used by advocates of gender equitable land rights. Focuses on the Uluguru mountains and shows that the need for registration is rather a consequence of its possibility and not of deficiencies of tenure security within the customary system, and that informal access to land can be experienced as more secure than formal registration. Further argues that demand to use land as collateral is low and risk-awareness especially among women high.

mokoro:5556;The new Tragedy of the Commons;Asks how can poor people protect their land rights? Stresses importance of land in the social, economic and political life of Africa and fact that land is contested all over Africa, with women’s rights particularly at risk. Land registration is inaccessible to most. African governments have often muddied the water, with land frequently used to reward political loyalty. The commons are especially important for poorer people, but everywhere are under growing pressure as privatisation and enclosure continue. The Commission for Africa has skirted around such issues, but there is much that aid donors could usefully do, including supporting civil society groups and media that can monitor land grabbing.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/new_tragedy_of_the_commons.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/the-new-tragedy-of-the-commons/;31-03-2005;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;Camilla Toulmin;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land grabbing;commons;land registration;land rights;women";Land & Gender;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Designed to be applied in situations where the co-management of natural resources is being encouraged and the poor must compete with other, often stronger, stakeholders to ensure that their rights are recognized. The moment of consultation and negotiation is the point at which the community possesses the most power to have an impact on decisions about how future development will take place.

mokoro:5637;Breathing Life into Dead Theories about Property Rights: de Soto and Land Relations in Rural Africa;Argues that there are 5 shortcomings in both the old (World Bank) and contemporary (Hernando de Soto) arguments for formalisation of land title. First, legality is constructed narrowly to mean only formal legality. Therefore legal pluralism is equated with extra-legality. Second, there is an underlying social-evolutionist bias that presumes inevitability of the transition to private (conflated with individual) ownership as the destiny of all societies. Third, the presumed link between formal title and access to credit facilities has not been borne out by empirical evidence. Fourth, markets in land are understood narrowly to refer only to ‘formal markets’. Fifth, the arguments in favour of formalisation of title as the means to secure tenure ignore the fact that formal title could also generate insecurity.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/de_soto_and_land_relations_in_rural_africa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/breathing-life-into-dead-theories-about-property-rights-de-soto-and-land-relations-in-rural-africa/;31-10-2006;;Institute of Development Studies;Institute of Development Studies;Celestine Nyamu-Musembi;en;Reports & Research;002;"property;legal pluralism;property rights;land";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
mokoro:5577;For or Against Gender Equality? Evaluating the Post-Cold War ‘Rule of Law’ Reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa;The paper explores whether the post-Cold War rule of law reform agenda in sub-Saharan Africa has enhanced or impeded gender equity. Argues that a large part of the gender equality agenda remains unaddressed by the legal and institutional reforms undertaken so far. The section on reforms to property laws suggests that they have at worst deepened gender inequality and at best left biases intact. Official discussion of gender and land tenure remains disconnected from broader processes of economic restructuring. Financial sector reforms have not been co-ordinated with reform of land and family legislation and practice, yet land and family law are at the heart of women’s ability to access financial services.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/evaluating_post_cold_war_rule_of_law_reforms.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/for-or-against-gender-equality-evaluating-the-post-cold-war-rule-of-law-reforms-in-sub-saharan-africa/;31-08-2005;;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development;;Celestine Nyamu-Musembi;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;property law;land tenure;reforms;property;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Given that this is a new method for group tenure interests in resource management, the process should be dynamic and invite close analysis for improvement. This study specifically documents: 1) how tenure issues have been considered in the establishment of community forests; and how rights in land can constrain or support community involvement in community forest management; 2) how communities secure their tenure rights in community forests; how the resources are utilised such that user rights are both respected and protected; and 3) the roles played by different local stakeholders in creating the CLAs. Tenure issues were found to manifest themselves in unexpected ways as members of the community itself were not concerned about potential restrictions on themselves, as long as they could secure tenure to the forest.";http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/tenure_in_community_forests_uganda.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/tenure-in-community-forests-a-study-on-communal-land-associations-as-forest-management-regimes-in-budongo-masindi-district-uganda/;31-08-2004;;;;"Christopher Paul;Herbert Kamusiime;Esther Obaikol;Margaret Rugadya";en;Reports & Research;"002;UGA";"community forestry;forest land;local community;community land rights;customary tenure;research;forest management plans;sustainable land management";"Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:5965;Land Tenure and Economic Activities in Uganda: a Literature Review;Examines the literature on Uganda’s tenure systems, including the legal and administrative frameworks and their implementation at the local level, analyses the relations between these elements and tenure security and discusses ways in which land may relate to economic activities. Implementation of reforms has been slow and partial. The literature shows that the division of labour between land administration institutions at the different administrative levels is not clearly spelled out and that they are often inaccessible at the local level. Research has shown that despite the existence of a gender-sensitive legal framework in Uganda, women are discriminated against in both customary and statutory settings. Therefore, improving women’s access to land by reinforcing women’s rights at the local level would be a fundamental step and interventions should target the entire range of institutions that are important for women’s access to land.;http://pure.diis.dk/ws/files/56058/WP2012_13_Uganda_Rachel_Spichiger_m.fl_web.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-tenure-and-economic-activities-in-uganda-a-literature-review/;30-11-2012;;Danish Institute for International Studies;Danish Institute for International Studies;"Rasmus Hundsbaek Pedersen;Rachel Apichiger;Sarah Alobo;Michael Kidoido";en;Reports & Research;"002;UGA";"land;land administration;research;reforms;land tenure;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Experimenting with Market-based Land Reform in South Africa;"Paper reviews the South African experience with land reform, and land redistribution in particular, up to the end of 2005. Looks at various aspects of market-based land reform – landowner veto on participation in land reform; payment of ‘market prices’ for land; self-selection of beneficiaries; focus on ‘commercial’ forms of production; prominent role for the private sector in provision of credit, extension, and other services. The experience suggests that market-based approaches are incapable of effecting a large-scale redistribution of land or restructuring of the agrarian economy, and are likely to be met with growing popular opposition as the crisis of rural livelihoods grows and the limitations of ‘willing seller, willing buyer’ become apparent.";http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/lrac-30;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/state-market-or-the-worst-of-both-experimenting-with-market-based-land-reform-in-south-africa/;31-01-2007;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Edward Lahiff;en;Reports & Research;"ZAF;002";"land;scale;willing seller;land reform";;Land Use, Management & Investment

Draws attention to the effects of land policy for the poor, arguing that land rights are often instruments in local politics and power relations. Highlights local processes of differentiation and examines how relationships between land, livelihoods, and poverty are changing in the current context of rapid rural-urban change and ‘de-agrarianisation’. Asks what entry-points there are for pro-poor change in and through land policy and administration. Situates land policy historically and in the wider development context and sets out a way of approaching contemporary land issues from a pro-poor perspective.

Further argues that the model of market-based land redistribution favoured by the Bank will be insufficient to dissipate the pressures of ever-growing inequality.

mokoro:8778;Of local people and investors: The dynamics of land rights configuration in Tanzania;Analyses the configuration of land rights among different users of land and discusses the implementation of Tanzania’s land policy reform. The key rights explored include those of small-scale producers (farmers and pastoralists) and large-scale investors. Explores how the state defines, allocates, protects and compensates for land when it appropriates such rights. Looks at the formal, informal and procedural rights that provide for and protect the rights of small-scale producers and investors, and the compensation offered to those who give up their land for investment. Also discusses how these rights are configured during the investment negotiation and implementation phases of land deals. Argues that while the proposed draft National Land Policy of 2016 tries to address the core problems related to the poor implementation of the 1995 Land Policy, the current draft also has significant shortcomings and is only likely to be successful if the process becomes more inclusive, prioritizes small-scale local producers, and addresses issues of inequality and ethnic and class-based struggles over land.;http://pure.diis.dk/ws/files/1220266/DIIS_WP_2017_10.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/local-people-investors-dynamics-land-rights-configuration-tanzania/;31-01-2018;;;Danish Institute for International Studies;Emmanuel Sulle;en;Reports & Research;"TZA;002";"land;pastoralists;land deals;farmers;compensation;land rights;scale";"Land & Investments;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5455;A Research Report on Land Tenure and Agricultural Development in Ethiopia: executive summary;"A comprehensive research report covers the literature, includes a large survey of farm households throughout Ethiopia, and surveys the opinions of professionals. Land tenure is now a hotly debated issue; land scarcity and degradation are serious. Tenure security is seen as more important than the form of ownership. Almost three-quarters of farmers surveyed fear future distributions of land. Government is afraid that moving from state to private ownership will lead to massive evictions through distress sales, but over 90% farmers said they would not sell their land if they could. Farmers are more pragmatic than professionals. Government believes that failings of the system can be compensated through increases in productivity as a result of its extension programme, but this is highly doubtful. Larger size holdings perform better than smaller. Informal markets are starting despite a formal prohibition ï¿½ this should be encouraged. Vast majority believe existing land tenure system is a major constraint to agricultural productivity and that government should open a forum for wider debate on land tenure.";http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/land_tenure_and_agric_dev_ethiopia.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/a-research-report-on-land-tenure-and-agricultural-development-in-ethiopia-executive-summary/;31-10-2002;;"Ethiopian Economic Association;Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute ";"Ethiopian Economic Association;Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute ";;en;Reports & Research;"002;ETH";"land;farmers;land tenure;eviction;private ownership;research";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5478;How can Land Tenure Reform contribute to Poverty Reduction? Report from the European Forum on Rural Development Cooperation;Official report from the European Forum on the sessions relating to land tenure reform and poverty reduction.

These included the need for donors to engage more in the political aspects of land reform, including redistribution, to work more collaboratively, to think longer term, consider a broad range of options, and to take more account of traditional land institutions and customary rights, while land tenure reform needs to be linked to wider rural development policies.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/european_forum_report_land_tenure_reform.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/how-can-land-tenure-reform-contribute-to-poverty-reduction-report-from-the-european-forum-on-rural-development-cooperation/;31-12-2002;;;;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land tenure;poverty;rural development;land reform";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

A synthesis of studies from Asia and West Africa and emerging recommendations;Analyses inheritance laws and their impacts on rural women in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Senegal, Togo and Mali.

Shows that women continue to be systematically denied their rights to inheritance, especially in rural areas. Inheritance practices are deeply embedded in local culture and tradition and, even though civil and religious laws exist that protect women’s inheritance, customary laws are found to prevail, which largely exclude women from property ownership and inheritance.;http://www.landcoalition.org/sites/default/files/documents/resources/web_framing_the_debate_islamic_inheritance_.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/islamic-inheritance-laws-impact-rural-women-synthesis-studies-asia-west-africa-emerging-recommendations/;31-08-2016;;;;Frida Khan;en;Reports & Research;002;"property;area;customary law;rural areas;women";Land & Gender;Land Use, Management & Investment

With many killings unreported, and even less investigated, likely that the true number is actually far higher. This tide of violence driven by an intensifying fight for land and natural resources, as mining, logging, hydro-electric and agricultural companies trample on people and the environment in their pursuit of profit. As more and more extractive projects were imposed on communities, many of those who dared to speak out and defend their rights were brutally silenced. Tells the stories of these activists and the threats they’ve faced. Highlights the courage of their communities as they stand up to the might of multinationals, paramilitaries and even their own governments in the most dangerous countries on Earth to be a defender.

mokoro:8908;Power and Rights in the Community: Paralegals as Leaders in Women’s Legal Empowerment in Tanzania;What can an analysis of power in local communities contribute to debates on women’s legal empowerment and the role of paralegals in Africa? Drawing upon theories of power and rights, and research on legal empowerment in African plural legal systems, this article explores the challenges for paralegals in facilitating women’s access to justice in Tanzania, which gave statutory recognition to paralegals in the Legal Aid Act 2017. Land conflicts represent the single-biggest source of local legal disputes in Tanzania and are often embedded in gendered land tenure relations. Argues that paralegals can be effective actors in women’s legal empowerment where they are able to work as leaders, negotiating power relations and resisting the forms of violence that women encounter as obstacles to justice. Paralegals’ authority will be realised when their role is situated within community leadership structures, confirming their authority while preserving their independence.;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10691-018-9371-6.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/power-and-rights-in-the-community-paralegals-as-leaders-in-womens-legal-empowerment-in-tanzania/;31-03-2018;Feminist Legal Studies (Fem Leg Stud);;;Helen Dancer;en;Reports & Research;"TZA;002";"land conflicts;land;legal empowerment;land tenure;research;women";"Land Conflicts;Land & Gender";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
mokoro:6028;Lessons for the New Alliance and Land Transparency Initiative: Gender Impacts of Tanzania’s Land Investment Policy;There are gender-differentiated impacts when land is harnessed for commercial investment. Land policy needs to address the gendered nature of power relations within families and land tenure systems, and the implications of rural social relations on processes of community consultation, land management and dispute settlement. Without this, land investment policies will not reach their goals of tenure security for all, agricultural productivity and increased revenue. From the outset the full participation of women as well as men, good local leadership and gender-sensitive business practices at the local level are needed, to ensure that the fruits of land-based investment deals in the countryside are gender-equitable.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Policy_Brief_067.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/lessons-for-the-new-alliance-and-land-transparency-initiative-gender-impacts-of-tanzanias-land-investment-policy/;31-03-2014;;Future Agricultures Consortium;;Helen Dancer;en;Reports & Research;"TZA;002";"land tenure;land;land management;land tenure systems;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:6067;Gender implications of agricultural commercialisation: The case of sugarcane production in Kilombero District, Tanzania;"Since the global food crisis of 2008 the Tanzanian government has made food security through increases in agricultural productivity a policy priority. The emphasis is on commercialisation, with a particular focus on large-scale rice and sugarcane production. Gender equity within African agricultural production is a critical issue; yet limited empirical research exists on the gender implications of agricultural commercialisation now taking place in the region. Presents findings from fieldwork in Kilombero District in 2013-14. Takes the country’s largest sugar producer – Kilombero Sugar Company Ltd – as its focus and analyses the socio-economic implications of the commercialisation of sugarcane production from a gender perspective. Findings demonstrate the significance of gender relations in the development of commercial agricultural business models, local socio-economic development and land titling measures. Also illustrate the pressures and benefits for relationships and resource-sharing within households in the transition from food crops to sugarcane production.";http://www.future-agricultures.org/publications/working-papers-document/gender-implications-of-agricultural-commercialisation-the-case-of-sugarcane-production-in-kilombero-district-tanzania/;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/gender-implications-of-agricultural-commercialisation-the-case-of-sugarcane-production-in-kilombero-district-tanzania/;31-05-2015;;Future Agricultures Consortium;;"Helen Dancer;Emmanuel Sulle";en;Reports & Research;"TZA;002";"land;research;food security;scale;land titling";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:8800;Zimbabwe urgently needs a new land administration system;Zimbabwe today has an agrarian structure made up of small, medium and large farms, all under different forms of land ownership. A landscape once dominated by 4,500 large-scale commercial farmers is now populated by about 145,000 smallholder households, occupying 4.1 million hectares, and around 23,000 medium-scale farmers on 3.5 million hectares. Knowing exactly who has land and where is difficult. Illegal multiple allocations combine with unclear boundary demarcations and an incomplete recording system. Many new land owners don’t have formal documentation and lack leases or permits confirming ownership. There is a great deal of uncertainty given the often haphazard, sometimes corrupt, approach to land reallocation that took place under the land reform programme.

mokoro:8047;Tainted Lands: Corruption in Large-Scale Land Deals;Section I provides an overview of large-scale land deals. It assesses the trend at a global level and examines structural obstacles faced by efforts to regulate such deals. Section II focuses on corruption as a major obstacle to improving the protection of local communities and indigenous peoples whose livelihood, identities, and traditional ways of life depend on the use of local lands and natural resources. This phenomenon is largely understudied because corruption, by its very nature, is hidden and therefore poorly documented. Section III explores domestic legislation, international treaties and multi-stakeholder initiatives that have aimed to address various aspects of corruption and land rights issues. Section IV concludes by offering a set of policy recommendations targeted toward investors, banks and other financial institutions, states where investments in land are made, and states where investors are headquartered.;https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/18677/Tainted_Lands_Report_FINAL.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/tainted-lands-corruption-large-scale-land-deals/;30-11-2016;;"International Corporate Accountability Roundtable;Global Witness";"International Corporate Accountability Roundtable;Global Witness";Olivier De Schutter;en;Reports & Research;002;"scale;land deals;land rights;indigenous peoples;corruption;land";"Land & Investments;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:7862;Inclusive Land Governance in Mozambique: Good Law, Bad Politics?;Analyses inclusive land governance in Mozambique. Focuses on the country’s legal framework and the DUAT, the right to use and benefit from the land. The DUAT is a distinctive element of the Mozambican legislation that has land as the property of the state but recognises land use rights for occupants and users on the basis of a unitary system of tenure. The challenges of putting in practice what is thought to be one of Africa’s most progressive legal frameworks are discussed. These are set against a context where despite land abundance there are concerns over land grabbing and dispossession of rural communities, which constitute over 70 per cent of the country’s population. The law may be progressive but government politics are not, as an increasingly hegemonic elite controls Mozambique’s political system and resources.;http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/inclusive-land-governance-in-mozambique-good-law-bad-politics;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/inclusive-land-governance-mozambique-good-law-bad-politics/;31-08-2016;;;Institute of Development Studies;"Lidia Cabral;Simon Norfolk";en;Reports & Research;"002;MOZ";"land;use rights;land governance;dispossession;land grabbing;property;land use";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:6021;Implications of Community-based Legal Aid Regulation on Women’s Land Rights;Improving women’s ability to securely access land is recognized as an effective means to increase gender equality and advance other key social and economic development goals. Despite progressive laws in many African countries, gender disparities commonly persist in women’s access and ownership of land. Although legal empowerment of women can help to strengthen their claims to land, governments commonly lack the capacity to offer legal services. Civil society is increasingly stepping in to fill the wide gap in legal service provision, with the aim of empowering marginalized groups and individuals to exercise their legal rights. Although legal aid has wide application, this brief focuses on the consequences of regulating services provided at the community level to support women’s land rights in Tanzania.;http://cdm15738.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/128173/filename/128384.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/implications-of-community-based-legal-aid-regulation-on-womens-land-rights/;31-05-2014;;International Food Policy Research Institute;;"Lucy Billings;Ruth Meinzen-Dick;Valerie Mueller";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land rights;legal empowerment;women";Land & Gender;Access to Land & Tenure Security
mokoro:6077;Community-based monitoring of land acquisition. Lessons from the Buseruka oil refinery in Uganda;Under Ugandan law a person whose land is identified for a public purpose must be compensated fairly, promptly, and prior to the acquisition of the property. But often laws and best practices remain on paper only. Many individual landowners are often ignorant about their basic rights, and lack the capacity and courage to speak out against injustice meted on them by development projects. The decision by the Ugandan government to construct an oil refinery meant that over 1,200 households were to be displaced. A community-based monitoring tool was used to empower people affected by the project to be aware of their rights and responsibilities. As a result community monitors spoke from an informed and knowledgeable position which influenced the resettlement process in a positive way. The experiences in the application of this tool provide important lessons, notably that it is important to tailor the tool to local contexts, needs and capacities.;http://pubs.iied.org/12580IIED.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/community-based-monitoring-of-land-acquisition-lessons-from-the-buseruka-oil-refinery-in-uganda/;30-06-2015;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;Bashir Twesigye;en;Reports & Research;"002;UGA";"property;land;landowners";;

Despite progressive land legislation, elite groups and vested interests are consolidating land holdings while peasant producers are being dispossessed of their land and access to fertile plots is becoming increasingly difficult. As national and foreign investors seek land for housing, real estate, agriculture, tourism, mining and forestry, what is the state’s role in responding to these increased demands?

How can women’s rights be strengthened when decisions are being made about large-scale agricultural investments that affect their livelihoods? An IIED webinar involving Helen Dancer (University of Brighton) and Naseku Kisambu (TAWLA – Tanzania Women Lawyers Association) examined how women’s involvement in decision-making processes relating to land can be enhanced at the local level, focusing on commercial agriculture and village bylaws in Tanzania.;http://www.iied.org/enhancing-womens-role-land-management-decisions;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/enhancing-womens-role-land-management-decisions/;31-03-2016;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;Thierry Berger;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land management;agriculture;scale;women";Land & Gender;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:6079;Asserting community land rights using RSPO complaint procedures in Indonesia and Liberia;The complaints procedure of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is one of the options available to communities threatened by the negative impacts of the palm oil industry. Drawing on direct experiences of supporting communities to use it in Indonesia and Liberia, the report summarises how communities can get the most out of this procedure. Realistic outcomes include a temporary freeze on plantation development while longer term solutions are negotiated. Advises that several advocacy strategies be pursued simultaneously to maximise chances of success. Also situates the RSPO complaints procedure in the context of other options, including use of national courts, media campaigns, regional and international human rights law procedures and the complaints procedures of major international finance institutions.;http://pubs.iied.org/12584IIED.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/asserting-community-land-rights-using-rspo-complaint-procedures-in-indonesia-and-liberia/;31-08-2015;;"International Institute for Environment and Development;Forest Peoples Programme";"International Institute for Environment and Development;Forest Peoples Programme";Tom Lomax;en;Reports & Research;"IDN;002;LBR";"community land rights;land rights;advocacy;land";Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:6078;A Time for Change? Comments on Chad’s draft Land Code;The process to develop a new Land Code in Chad is a positive step forward but the draft reflects a highly centralised system of land ownership, management and administration which risks excluding most people from the means to document and protect their land rights while also fostering widespread tenure insecurity. It considers customary rights as ‘temporary’ and gives full legal protection to a land title, which converts customary rights into land ownership, which is likely to be inaccessible for the vast majority of the population. It does not address pastoral rights or gender nor provide clear rules and safeguards for the allocation of land to commercial investments. It only includes limited provisions on dispute resolution. Should a new law be adopted, resources for implementation, including capacity building, would need to be carefully budgeted for.;http://pubs.iied.org/G03953.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/a-time-for-change-comments-on-chads-draft-land-code/;31-07-2015;;"International Institute for Environment and Development;Tearfund";"International Institute for Environment and Development;Tearfund";"Lotenzo Cotula;Thierry Berger";en;Reports & Research;"002;TCD";"land rights;land;capacity building;land ownership";;Access to Land & Tenure Security
mokoro:6038;Agricultural commercialisation contracts: concessions over people?;Recent actual and expected changes in global agricultural commodity prices have fostered a renewed business interest in tropical agriculture. Agricultural commercialisation concessions (ACCs) are contracts between governments and agribusiness companies allowing the company to supply inputs, purchase farm produce and also sometimes run processing operations and/or provide storage, marketing and distribution services in a given geographical area. ACCs could provide new livelihood opportunities, however certain features of the contractual processes and clauses raise concerns that they are concluded with little consultation and grant companies monopoly rights. IIED is following ACC development closely, although most contracts are not publicly available and confidentiality restrictions apply. Discusses some of the issues at stake with the aim of promoting awareness and public debate.;http://pubs.iied.org/17260IIED.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/agricultural-commercialisation-contracts-concessions-over-people/;31-10-2014;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;;en;Reports & Research;002;"agriculture;area";;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:6005;Land grabbing: is conservation part of the problem or the solution?;Presents the experience of international development, wildlife and human rights practitioners, shared at a symposium on land grabbing and conservation in March. Land can be ‘grabbed’ for ‘green’ purposes, triggering conflicts that undermine potential synergies. Expanded state protected areas, land for carbon offset markets and REDD, and for private conservation projects all potentially conflict with community rights. Such conflict is counterproductive because secure customary and communal land tenure helps enable sustainable natural resource management by local communities.;http://pubs.iied.org/17166IIED.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-grabbing-is-conservation-part-of-the-problem-or-the-solution/;30-09-2013;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;;en;Reports & Research;002;"protected areas;area;land grabbing;land tenure;land";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:7807;When investors come knocking: ensuring African women have a say;In much of sub-Saharan Africa, women have little say in decisions over land. Unless proactive steps are taken to enable women to have a stronger voice, large-scale agribusiness projects will leave them even more marginalised. Though there has been little research in this area, an emerging body of thinking and practice provides clear pointers as to how governments, NGOs and investors might mitigate such risks in future, particularly by explicitly addressing gender issues head-on from the very outset.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/17361IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/investors-come-knocking-ensuring-african-women-say-2/;30-06-2016;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;"Catriona Knapman;Philippine Sutz";en;Reports & Research;002;"area;land;research;scale;women";Land & Gender;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:6082;Reconsidering approaches to women’s land rights in sub-Saharan Africa;Emphasises the need for donors, NGOs and governments to take a more comprehensive approach to women’s land rights that addresses underlying gender dynamics to bring about transformative gender change rather than token gains for women. To be effective, work to secure women’s rights to land must focus on tackling social relations to transform gender dynamics and needs to start at household level. Efforts to secure women’s land rights also need to move beyond generalisations about customary practices to document diverse and evolving local systems and the opportunities they provide to promote women’s voices and decision-making power.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/17310IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/reconsidering-approaches-to-womens-land-rights-in-sub-saharan-africa/;30-09-2015;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;"Catriona Knapman;Philippine Sutz";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land rights;women";Land & Gender;Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:6048;Walking with villagers: How Liberia’s Land Rights Policy was shaped from the grassroots;In Liberia it is estimated that around half the country’s land mass has been promised to foreign companies and investors. From 2009-11 the Sustainable Development Institute and NAMATI embarked on an action research project to support rural communities to protect, document, and manage their customary lands and natural resources. Drawing from lessons learned in the field, they sought to bring the voices and realities from rural Liberia to influential policymakers. In 2012-3 they embarked on a policy advocacy campaign utilising a diverse set of tactics to influence Liberia’s newly proposed Land Rights Policy. The Policy, passed in 2013, is an historic and progressive document which recognises and guarantees customary land ownership to rural communities in an unprecedented way. Provides insights that may be of interest to practitioners in other countries engaging in land reforms.;http://pubs.iied.org/G03832.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/walking-with-villagers-how-liberias-land-rights-policy-was-shaped-from-the-grassroots/;31-10-2014;;"International Institute for Environment and Development;Sustainable Development Institute;Namati";"International Institute for Environment and Development;Sustainable Development Institute;Namati";"Ali Kaba;Gaurav Madan";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;sustainable development;advocacy;research;land rights;reforms;land reform;land ownership";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Access to Land & Tenure Security

This process is seen to be occurring even without state protection of private land rights through titling. Gender as an analytical category is excluded in evolutionary models. Women are accommodated only in their dependent position as the wives of landholders in idealised ’households’. Argues that gender relations are central to the organisation and transformation of landholding systems. Women have faced different forms of tenure insecurity, both as wives and in their relations with wider kin, as landholding systems have been integrated into wider markets. These cannot be addressed while evolutionary models dominate the policy debate.

mokoro:8797;Unjust Burden. How smallholder farmers in Africa are adapting to climate change to improve their food security;"Over the last two decades, 200 million people across the world have been lifted out of hunger. But as climate change brings more frequent and severe weather shocks such as droughts and floods, and makes rainfall patterns less predictable, these gains are under threat, especially among Africa’s smallholder farmers. Agriculture is Africa’s biggest employer. But mean temperatures are expected to rise faster in the continent than the global average, decreasing crop yields and deepening poverty. IRIN has now completed a project to outline the challenges that global warming is triggering, and to explore what local communities are doing to adapt and reduce their vulnerability. This e-book covers 4 countries – Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zimbabwe – with the goal of sharing lessons learned so that small-scale farmers everywhere can be better supported as their challenges multiply. It provides a platform for policy discussion, and for the voices of those men and women on the front lines of climate change to be heard. It contains field reporting on: climate-related problems and threats such as desertification in Nigeria, soil salination in Senegal, and the lack of technical support available to smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe; the range of responses and solutions adopted by farmers and governments; and how livestock-raising communities in the Kenyan county of Turkana are facing up to one of the worst droughts in living memory.";https://assets.irinnews.org/s3fs-public/unjust_burden.pdf?DJNYQw3b4pNQFLbJ603ILDnJSgKLdrYX;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/unjust-burden-smallholder-farmers-africa-adapting-climate-change-improve-food-security/;31-12-2017;;IRIN;IRIN;;en;Reports & Research;002;"food security;farmers;climate change;desertification;scale;poverty;agriculture;women";"Land & Gender;Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:5730;Land and decentralisation in Senegal;"Land and decentralisation policies in Senegal have been closely linked since independence in 1960. Public lands are currently managed by the local governments of municipalities and rural communities, with the latter responsible for the land and natural resources in unprotected parts of their territory, and the former empowered to issue building permits. The law also provides opportunities for rural communities, municipalities and regions to be involved in managing special areas such as classified forests, national parks and protected spaces, thereby recognising that land and natural resources cannot be managed effectively unless the communities concerned are engaged in the process through their local governments. Popular participation depends on several factors: how far the central government and administration are prepared to go in involving local people and local governments, and therefore what rights they grant them; the competences and resources available to communities; and the human and financial resources that local governments can call upon in order to fulfil their roles. Explores these issues and discusses their effect on decentralisation and land management in Senegal.";http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12550IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-and-decentralisation-in-senegal/;31-05-2008;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;Jacques Faye;en;Reports & Research;"002;SEN";"area;land;territory;land management";;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:5902;Are land deals driving ‘water grabs’?;Investors often look for land with a high growing potential, which means land with lots of rainfall or land that can be irrigated. In multimillion dollar investments involving irrigation, investors typically want to secure water rights as part of the deal. Motivated by potential revenues from water fees and the prospect of improved agricultural productivity, many African governments are signing away water rights for decades to large investors. But they are doing so with little regard for how this will impact the millions of other users whose livelihoods depend on customary access to water. A real danger of setting a long-term precedent that could compromise sustainable and equitable supply to all users in the future.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/17102IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/are-land-deals-driving-water-grabs/;30-11-2011;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;"Jamie Skinner;Lorenzo Cotula";en;Reports & Research;002;"land deals;water rights;land";Land & Investments;Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:6354;Lands of the Future: transforming pastoral lands and livelihoods in eastern Africa;Pastoral and agro-pastoral areas in eastern Africa and elsewhere have long been regarded as peripheries in economic terms and in terms of social and cultural accomplishments. Although biased perceptions of the ‘unproductive’ uses of pastoralism have become outdated, government policies still do little to formally recognise or integrate pastoral lands as critical parts of rural livelihood systems and economic development models. Instead, many states give preference to large-scale agricultural investments in pastoral areas, resulting in the loss or fragmentation of rangelands, induced sedentarisation of pastoralists, and a radical reduction in livestock numbers. Looks at the significance of pastoralism as a productive economy and the positive bearing it has on the environment, wildlife conservation, and the health and well-being of pastoral communities. Reflects on what is at stake when one form of land use is replaced by another and when customary rules and practices are not fully recognised by policy makers. Using historical examples and current development trends, shows how the impacts of such development need not be negative. The authors urge development planners and governments to integrate the expertise of agro-pastoralists into development models and to establish strong relationships between investors, policy makers, researchers, local communities and other stakeholders in order to find equitable and long-term solutions for changing land uses.;http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/en/publications/working_papers/wp0154;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/lands-of-the-future-transforming-pastoral-lands-and-livelihoods-in-eastern-africa/;30-09-2014;;Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology;Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology;"Jon Abbink;Kelly Askew;Dereje Feyissa Dori;Elliot Fratkin;Echi Christina Gabbert;John Galaty;Shauna LaTosky;Jean Lydall;Hussein A.

mokoro:5448;The Land Debate in Mozambique: will Foreign Investors, the Urban Elite, Advanced Peasants or Family Farmers Drive Rural Development?;"Land is again the subject of debate in Mozambique, 5 years after the passage of a land law which won praise for protecting peasant rights while creating space for outside investment. The new debate is about whether land, or at least land ’titles’, should be able to be sold and mortgaged, are whether more emphasis should be put on improving conditions for would-be investors rather than delimiting and protecting peasant land and capacitating communities to deal with investors. Argues that the debate on land is actually a proxy for a debate about rural development. There are sharp divisions within government, the World Bank, donor agencies, and Mozambican civil society. The land debate is also linked to one over rural credit and support for farmers. Looks at what land is available for investors and at the difference between free or vacant land and underused land. The law gives communities the right to delimit and register their land. Delimitation gives communities power, but the process can cause problems, raising expectations and sometimes disinterring old disputes. Although the process is expensive and time-consuming, it may be the only way to protect peasant rights. Cites proposals already made by Mozambicans and foreigners working on the land issue on: continuing the work of the land commission; improving consultation; continuing delimitation; creating a kind of community organiser, facilitator or barefoot planner; enforcement of regulations and agreements; pilot partnerships; credit guarantee funds; increased transparency. Concludes by stressing the central role of Mozambican NGOs, but raises a number of questions about their increased role as service agencies and their ability to do what may be asked of them.";http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/land_debate_in_mozambique_hanlon.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/the-land-debate-in-mozambique-will-foreign-investors-the-urban-elite-advanced-peasants-or-family-farmers-drive-rural-development/;31-07-2002;;;Oxfam Great Britain;Joseph Hanlon;en;Reports & Research;"002;MOZ";"land;land law;rural development;farmers";;Land Policy & Legislation

mokoro:5585;Land Rights: where we are and where we need to go;Review of the situation of land rights in Apac District and of opportunities for land rights protection work. Examines the 1998 Land Act and its implementation in practice. Finds that the protection clauses for women are proving ineffective. Also looks at the major threats and barriers to land rights and suggests ways forward. Among many other pertinent questions, asks why the Ugandan Government has shown so little interest in customary tenure and why it pursues land titling to the extent it does. Argues that state institutions are not functioning as prescribed and have not been equipped to deal with land disputes. Landlessness is growing and it is proving harder for people to defend their land rights.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/lemu_land_rights_where_we_are_and_where_we_need_to_go.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-rights-where-we-are-and-where-we-need-to-go/;30-09-2005;;Land Equity Movement of Uganda;Land Equity Movement of Uganda;Judy Adoko;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;customary tenure;land dispute;land rights;land titling;landlessness;women";"Land Conflicts;Land & Gender";Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:5710;Land Reform and Rural Territories: Experiences from Brazil and South Africa;"Despite programmes for rural land reform and redistribution around the world, inequitable land distribution and rural poverty remain profound in much of the rural South. Suggests a new approach to land reform and rural development. ‘Rural territorial development’ is based on and encourages shared territorial identity (distinctive productive, historical, cultural and environmental features) amongst different stakeholders and social groupings. Builds on the fact that rural people’s livelihood strategies are complex and often mostly non-agricultural in nature. Works by (1) promoting collaboration between different sectoral agencies, levels and administrative units of government, and with civil society and private sector actors, within distinctive geographical spaces; and (2) creating new, inclusive multi-stakeholder fora for participatory development planning and implementation at the meso scale – working across groupings of local municipalities, which are often too small on their own to drive economic development.";http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/14559IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-reform-and-rural-territories-experiences-from-brazil-and-south-africa/;28-02-2008;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;Julian Quan;en;Reports & Research;"ZAF;002;BRA";"land;environment;land distribution;scale;poverty;rural development;land reform";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:5892;Gendered land rights in the rural areas of Namaqualand: a study of women’s perceptions and understandings;Focuses on women’s perceptions of land rights in the communal areas of Namaqualand in the Northern Cape. Explores the links between patriarchal social systems and women’s conservative attitudes towards holding land and shows how current policy processes and legislation allow local customs to continue to entrench gender discriminatory practices. Findings indicate that women are disadvantaged by historical norms, values and attitudes, which afford them only secondary rights to land. Yet, informal land practices, however limited, show that in some cases women are creating opportunities to gain access to land independently. For this to become the norm rather than an exception, these practices need recognition and support.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/KarinKleinbooiMiniThesisl.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/gendered-land-rights-in-the-rural-areas-of-namaqualand-a-study-of-womens-perceptions-and-understandings/;30-06-2011;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Karin Kleinbooi;en;Reports & Research;002;"area;land;land rights;rural areas;women";Land & Gender;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5654;A sociological analysis of intermediary non-governmental organizations and land reform in contemporary Zimbabwe;The thesis offers a sociological understanding of intermediary NGOs in the modern world through a study of NGOs and land reform in contemporary Zimbabwe.

Local empowering initiatives have dramatically asserted themselves against globalizing trajectories. These changes have posed serious challenges to land NGOs involved in land reform either as advocates for reform or as rural development NGOs. Shows how a range of diverse land NGOs has handled the heightened contradictions in their social field in ways that maintain their organizational coherence and integrity.;http://www.researchgate.net/publication/34658406_A_sociological_analysis_of_intermediary_non-governmental_organizations_and_land_reform_in_contemporary_Zimbabwe_;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/a-sociological-analysis-of-intermediary-non-governmental-organizations-and-land-reform-in-contemporary-zimbabwe/;30-09-2006;;;Rhodes University;Kirk Helliker;en;Reports & Research;"002;ZWE";"land;rural development;land reform";;

The spirit of the meetings was encouraging about the prospects for serious debate, notwithstanding the very different points of view on what equitable and sustainable land reform means in different constituencies.

mokoro:8117;Gender & Collectively Held Land. Good Practices and Lessons Learned from Six Global Case Studies;Seeks to answer the question, where collective tenure arrangements are either being formalized or supported for the sake of securing the community’s rights to land, what steps are required to strengthen women’s land rights in the process? Synthesizes findings from case studies in China, Ghana, India, the Kyrgyz Republic, Namibia, and Peru that assess interventions to strengthen collective tenure and ensure that both women and men benefit from improved land tenure security. The purpose was to understand how formalizing or securing rights to collectively held lands can affect women and men differently and how projects and interventions can best address gender differences. The focus is on practice, not theory, with the goal of informing the implementation of other similar interventions.;http://www.landesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016-Best-Practices-Synthesis-Report.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/gender-collectively-held-land-good-practices-lessons-learned-six-global-case-studies/;31-12-2016;;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land tenure;land rights;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
mokoro:8123;Namibia: Good Practices and Lessons Learned for Gender and Communal Land;Focuses on communal land and attempts to better understand the intersection of gender, communal land, and land reform in Namibia. Concentrates on two regions that adopted different approaches. The Oshana region leads the implementation of the nationwide Communal Land Reform Act, 2002, that introduced the registration of customary land rights in communal areas, while the Kavango region declined to participate in this and instead continues to independently administer customary land rights in accordance with its established customary system. Attempts to illustrate what measures can be implemented in different political, legal, and cultural contexts to enable communities facing similar situations to benefit from the experiences of others.;http://www.landesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016-Best-Practices-Case-Namibia.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/namibia-good-practices-lessons-learned-gender-communal-land/;31-08-2016;;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;;en;Reports & Research;"002;NAM";"customary land rights;land;land rights;land reform;area";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Concludes that the village is a promising example of the benefits of Communal Land rights registration. The villagers feel safer on their land, invest more, have fewer conflicts and more equitable inheritance. Believes that while land rights registration alone will not bring prosperity to communal areas, it does bring additional social stability and cohesion to communal areas, and has already significantly improved the lives of the households in Omahalya village.;http://www.focusonland.com/countries/case-study-what-does-registration-of-communal-land-mean-to-nambians-/;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/case-study-what-does-registration-of-communal-land-mean-to-namibians/;30-11-2014;;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;area;land grabbing;land registration;land rights;women";Land & Gender;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

The 1994 genocide, combined with the impacts of HIV/AIDS, created 300,000 orphans in Rwanda. Many are heads of households who urgently need land-use rights, but a weakened system of guardianship and increasing pressures on land often prevent this. Traditional support systems for Africa’s 34 million orphans (including 11 million ‘AIDS orphans’) have weakened over the years. The situation is particularly acute in Rwanda, where even before the genocide land pressures and poverty meant that many families were competing for land. Orphans experience many practical barriers, including lack of information, status, and few financial resources to defend their land rights. Makes a series of recommendations to the Rwandan government, including formulating and enforcing land laws specifically catering to orphans’ rights and designing national land-development programmes with the full participation of orphans.";http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/orphans_land_rights_postwar_rwanda.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/orphans-land-rights-in-post-war-rwanda-the-problem-of-guardianship/;30-09-2005;Development and Change;;Carnegie Mellon University;Laurel L.

In February 2010, the government announced that the settlers had to be removed and resettled in other ’uncontested lands’ in the area, compromising their rights to sustainable livelihoods, human development and land acquisition.

The case of conservancy land leases;Investigates private sector investment in conservation and ecotourism through conservancy land leases in the Mara region of Kenya. In recent and growing tourism development, groups of Maasai landowners are leasing their parcels of land to tourism investors and forming wildlife conservancies. Examines this model and the implications it has for Maasai livelihoods and the environment. Given the large extent and recent change in ownership in these areas, land leases do however keep the lands they cover together and are potentially an optimistic outlook for such open rangeland areas. Consideration however must be given to adjacent areas and communities that may face the negative knock on effects of such schemes. Within the Mara, land leases have been rapidly expanded upon, implying that similar schemes might be of interest to both investors and communities alike in other wildlife areas.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/ldpi-09;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/conservation-and-ecotourism-on-privatised-land-in-the-mara-kenya-the-case-of-conservancy-land-leases/;31-10-2012;;Land Deal Politics Initiative;;Claire Bedelian;en;Reports & Research;"002;KEN";"land;area;environment;leases;landowners;land area";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment

Looks at threats to San lands in 4 distinct parts of the country and the legal issues raised by those threats. Recommendations cover who owns the land, land reform, reforming governmental administration, law, social change and San rights.

mokoro:5711;Policy options for land reform in South Africa: New Institutional Mechanisms?;Since the 2005 Land Summit, new approaches to land reform have been on the agenda, yet there remains little clarity on the way forward. The main focus has been on means of accelerating the redistribution of land through new modes of acquiring land. Acquisition is an important matter but if treated in isolation risks mis-specifying the core problems evident in land reform in South Africa. A new phase of land reform located within a wider agrarian reform is needed and will require new institutional arrangements. Any alternative strategy will have to revise the institutional mechanisms that have been handling land reform thus far: are the procedures and the institutions that are in place to design and implement land reform adequate and appropriate to the kind of new tasks envisaged? What new farming units and activities are intended, and what post-transfer support will be required to make this agricultural system productive? This paper explores mechanisms appropriate to one kind of agricultural alternative: a vision of a productive, small-scale essentially household farm sector. Draws on experiences from Latin America and elsewhere in Africa.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/pb26;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/policy-options-for-land-reform-in-south-africa-new-institutional-mechanisms/;31-10-2007;;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Lionel Cliffe;en;Reports & Research;"ZAF;002";"scale;land;agrarian reform;land reform";;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:5377;Making Progress – Slowly. New Attention to Women’s Rights in Natural Resource Law Reform in Africa;Critical shifts are affecting rural resource rights in Africa through widespread reform in land, forestry and other laws. The cutting edge of transformation affecting women is in emerging new provision for wives to hold family property as co-owners with their husbands, which could play a main role in revitalising smallholder agriculture. Recognition that equity in domestic land relations may ultimately be a prerequisite to the modernisation of subsistence agriculture in agrarian economies is the thesis underlying the analysis of legal texts in this paper. More pervasive improvement in women’s resource rights is emerging though indirect changes in law especially those that alter the balance of authority over land and landed resources between state and people with broadly democratising effect. Important for women is greater accessibility to tenure administration, dispute resolution machinery and resource management functions occurring through devolution of centres of control to the periphery.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/making_progress_slowly.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/making-progress-slowly-new-attention-to-womens-rights-in-natural-resource-law-reform-in-africa/;28-02-2001;;;;Liz Alden Wily;en;Reports & Research;002;"forestry;land;property;agriculture;women";"Land & Gender;Forest Tenure";

mokoro:5707;So Who Owns the Forest? An Investigation into Forest Ownership and Customary Land Rights in Liberia;State/people forest relations are at a turning point in Liberia. The crux of the issue is property relations and how the rights of rural Liberians to forests are treated in law and in practice. Central to the problem and the solution is the status of customary land rights. The paper tracks what happened to the natural rights indigenous Liberians have to their lands and the valuable forests that grow on them. It looks back at the treatment of customary land tenure over the century-long process of forming the modern Liberian state. Through fieldwork, the study identifies customary property norms as operating today. It finds that colonial policy with regard to indigenous land interests was uncharacteristically benign, as was the imposition of indirect rule. Together these have created a foundation on which democratic land relations may be rebuilt. There is also genuine vibrancy in collective norms of customary tenure closely linked to the role of forestland in the rural economy. Interference in customary property rights is severe but mainly recent. Favourable conditions for remedying the situation exist. Remedial rather than radical action is required. Practical steps towards achieving a solution are suggested. Much rests on the proposed Community Rights Law.;https://www.sdiliberia.org/sites/default/files/publications/2008_So_Who_Owns_the_Forest%20(FullReport).pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/so-who-owns-the-forest-an-investigation-into-forest-ownership-and-customary-land-rights-in-liberia/;30-11-2007;;"Sustainable Development Institute;Fern";"Sustainable Development Institute;Fern";Liz Alden Wily;en;Reports & Research;"002;LBR";"property rights;customary tenure;land tenure;land rights;customary land rights;property;land";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

This is the first time the court has ruled on an indigenous peoples’ rights case or in a case with mass human rights violations indicated.

Study reveals that by early 2003, only about 100,000 of the original c.320,000 farm workers were still employed on the farms, the others are jobless and landless and have lost their entitlement to housing, basic social services and subsidised food. Only a quarter received severance packages. Family structures are under severe stress. There is an uneasy relationship with land reform beneficiaries, with conflicts over housing, land, water, and food.

mokoro:5799;Why it makes more sense to invest in farmers than in farmland;Large-scale land acquisitions can have lasting repercussions for the future of agriculture, including both agribusiness and family farming. Rather than rushing into land deals, governments and investors should properly consider the wider range of options to invest in agriculture. In many parts of the world, family farmers have proved efficient and dynamic. Working with them can generate healthy returns, avoid the risks associated with land acquisitions, and improve farmers’ livelihoods.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/17082IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/why-it-makes-more-sense-to-invest-in-farmers-than-in-farmland/;31-07-2010;;International Institute for Environment and Development;;Lorenzo Cotula;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;farmers;land deals;land acquisitions;farmland;scale;agriculture";Land & Investments;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:5603;Making law work for the poor;Legal processes can help improve the lives of the poor in developing countries e.g. through establishing fair rules on international trade and securing land access in rural Africa. For this to happen, poorer actors – whether individuals or states – must have equitable access to the legal system, including a fair say in law-making processes, and access to effective enforcement institutions. Development agencies should take law seriously and support local, national and international processes that improve legal access and make law work for the poor – including law reform, litigation, training, legal assistance and advocacy.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/11047IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/making-law-work-for-the-poor/;30-11-2005;;International Institute for Environment and Development;;Lorenzo Cotula;en;Reports & Research;002;"development agencies;land;land access;advocacy";Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:6076;Land rights and investment treaties: Exploring the interface;The spread and deepening of economic globalisation has highlighted the ever closer connections between the international legal arrangements for the governance of the global economy on the one hand, and claims to land and natural resources on the other. In a globalised world, land governance is shaped by international as well as national regulation. As pressures on valuable lands intensify and land relations become more trans-national, increasing recourse to international investment treaties is redesigning spaces for land claims at local and national levels. Report sheds light on how investment treaties can affect land rights. Finds that they can have far-reaching implications for land reform, for public action to address ‘land grabbing’ and for land governance frameworks. Charts directions for socio-legal research to explore how investment treaties are affecting land rights on the ground.;http://pubs.iied.org/12578IIED.html;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-rights-and-investment-treaties-exploring-the-interface/;30-06-2015;;International Institute for Environment and Development;;Lorenzo Cotula;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land governance;land grabbing;research;land rights;land reform";;Access to Land & Tenure Security

mokoro:5676;Legal empowerment for local resource control: Securing local resource rights within foreign investment projects in Africa;This report draws lessons from experience of using legal processes to secure local resource rights within the context of foreign investment projects in Africa. Security of local resource rights is a major challenge in many parts of Africa. The analysis of relevant law reveals that resource rights associated with more powerful interests (foreign investment) tend to enjoy greater legal protection compared to those held by local resource users. However, legal tools accompanied by adequate capacity-building efforts can help redress this imbalance and strengthen protection of local resource rights. By increasing local resource control, effective use of these tools can help disadvantaged groups gain greater control over their lives (‘legal empowerment’).;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12542IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/legal-empowerment-for-local-resource-control-securing-local-resource-rights-within-foreign-investment-projects-in-africa/;30-09-2007;;International Institute for Environment and Development;;Lorenzo Cotula;en;Reports & Research;002;legal empowerment;;

mokoro:5720;Legal empowerment in practice: Using legal tools to secure land rights in Africa;In many parts of Africa, legal services organisations have developed innovative ways for using legal processes to help disadvantaged groups have more secure land rights. Their approaches, tools and methods vary widely – from legal literacy training to paralegals programmes, from participatory methodologies to help local groups register their lands or negotiate with government or the private sector through to legal representation and strategic use of public interest litigation. The challenges they respond to also vary – from managing local land conflicts to challenging gender discrimination, through to securing land rights within the context of oil pipelines and mining projects. While some of this experience has been documented, much of it has not. Only a very limited part of this experience has fed into international debates, and there have been few opportunities for lesson-sharing and cross-fertilisation among practitioners. This report, based on a workshop at the University of Ghana in March 2008, aims to feed lessons from this local innovation into international processes. Includes cases studies from Cameroon, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Congo.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12552IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/legal-empowerment-in-practice-using-legal-tools-to-secure-land-rights-in-africa/;31-05-2008;;"International Institute for Environment and Development;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";;"Lorenzo Cotula;Paul Mathieu";en;Reports & Research;002;"land conflicts;mining;legal empowerment;land rights;land";Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security

It is not surprising that a recent wave of large-scale land acquisitions in Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America has sparked a major debate.

mokoro:8807;Trends in global land use investment: implications for legal empowerment;From the mid-2000s, a commodity boom underpinned a wave of land use investments in low- and middle-income countries. While agribusiness, mining and petroleum concessions often involve promises of jobs and public revenues, they have also prompted concerns about land dispossession, exclusionary investment models and infringements of the rights of vulnerable groups. One of the major challenges is in empowering rural people to make informed choices, exercise their rights and have their voices heard. A solid understanding of evolving investment trends is essential for designing effective initiatives. This report discusses evolving patterns in land use investments, developments in investment frameworks, and implications for legal empowerment approaches.;http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12606IIED.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/trends-global-land-use-investment-implications-legal-empowerment/;31-12-2017;;International Institute for Environment and Development;;"Lorenzo Cotula;Thierry Berger";en;Reports & Research;002;"mining;dispossession;land use;legal empowerment;land";;Land Use, Management & Investment

The objective is to inform policy processes on post-conflict land policy and administration on likely types of land conflicts and claims, their resolution, gaps in current land policy, resources needed. Survey suggests that Teso’s IDP displacement patterns are unique. Customary tenure has been transformed, with household heads now owners, not trustees, of rights in land, so clans are merely informed of sales. Common property resources are at greatest risk.

mokoro:5484;Land Tenure Policy and Practice in Botswana – Governance Lessons for Southern Africa;Like other countries in the region, Botswana inherited a dual system of statutory and customary tenure at independence.

Its land tenure policy has been described as one of careful change, responding to particular needs with specific tenure innovations. Botswana continues to adapt its land administration, based on customary rights and values, to a rapidly urbanising economy and expanding land market. Its approach is of interest because it is finding solutions to problems that continue to elude its neighbours.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/land_tenure_policy__practice_botswana.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-tenure-policy-and-practice-in-botswana-governance-lessons-for-southern-africa/;31-03-2003;;Mokoro;Mokoro;"Martin Adams;Faustin Kalabamu;Richard White";en;Reports & Research;"002;BWA";"land;land administration;customary tenure;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5509;Land use and rural livelihoods: Have they been enhanced through land reform?;It is often assumed that transferring land to rural households will provide people with valuable assets that can be productively used to enhance their livelihoods. Unfortunately, few rural people or land reform beneficiaries are perceived to be using land productively because they do not engage in significant commercial production for the market. Transferring land to subsistence users is therefore seen as a waste of resources. However, an examination of land use in communal areas and amongst land reform beneficiaries indicates that resource-poor rural people do use land productively and resourcefully, but the constraints to production and participation in agricultural markets they encounter limit their livelihoods to survivalist mode. Land reform can enhance rural livelihoods beyond this survivalist mode if it is integrated into a broader rural development programme aimed at providing subsistence land users with the support they need to overcome the constraints to production, and to connect them to the markets.;http://www.plaas.org.za/pb-5;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-use-and-rural-livelihoods-have-they-been-enhanced-through-land-reform/;31-08-2003;;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;"Maura Andrew;Charlie Shackleton;Andrew Ainslie";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;area;land use;rural development;waste;land reform";;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:5552;The context of land and resource rights struggles in Africa;Africa’s poor are heavily dependent on land and natural resources for livelihood, but some governments continue to resist transferring full resource management rights to them. This risks the loss or degradation of these resources, or their transfer into private hands. The continent’s development challenges are compounded by many factors, including unequal social, economic and political relations, the legacy of colonialism, globalisation, and collusive neo-liberal policy which favours capital and powerful allies. In addition, the voice of Africans in the debates which shape important processes at global, continental and national levels are seldom heard. The Pan-Africa Programme on Land and Resource Rights (PAPLRR) is a civil society initiative which sets out to address these issues.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/pb9;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/the-context-of-land-and-resource-rights-struggles-in-africa/;31-08-2004;;;;Munyaradzi Saruchera;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;management rights";;
mokoro:5551;Civil society and social movements: Advocacy for land and resource rights in Africa;Civil society formations in Africa have historically played an important part in the establishment of organising people in the pursuit of common goals. The majority of Africa’s people reside in rural areas where they derive their livelihoods from land, and for this majority secure access to land is the foundation of any efforts to alleviate poverty. Land reforms in Africa are at various stages of development in a number of countries, partly in response to pressures for liberalisation and privatisation from the World Bank and other like-minded institutions. Civil society organisations have played an important role in the development of progressive policies in some countries. The lessons learned from those countries must be applied in continuing advocacy for reforms which increase access among the poor to land and resource rights.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/PB12;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/civil-society-and-social-movements-advocacy-for-land-and-resource-rights-in-africa/;31-08-2004;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;;"Munyaradzi Saruchera;Michael O Odhiambo";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;rural areas;area;advocacy;poverty;reforms;land reform";;Land Use, Management & Investment

Studies show that legislation and regulations can be modified, reinterpreted or ignored during implementation, when local level power relations become critical. Thus building the capacity of community groups to take informed action is critical to long-term and sustainable pro-poor policy influence, and monitoring implementation is key for NGOs.

Over 86% of women reported they have access to land under customary tenure and c.63% of women reported they “own” land under customary tenure. Tenure security is not dependent on formal documentation as proof of ownership. Men play a dominant role in land management. General knowledge of statutory and customary land law and management systems is poor. c.50% of the population have experienced land conflicts, 72% are within household, family or clan. Interventions by NGOs and faith based institutions related to land conflict are minimal. Dynamics of women’s land and property rights in northern Uganda do not appear to be inherently different from the rest of the country. Strengthening customary institutions and practices in relation to women’s land and property rights is clearly the most effective way forward in the short to medium term.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/SecuringWomenLandRightsNorthernUganda_Oxfam.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/womens-land-rights-in-northern-uganda-west-nile-acholi-lango-teso-and-karamoja/;28-02-2014;;;Oxfam International;"Christopher Burke;Doreen Nancy Kobusingye";en;Reports & Research;002;"land conflicts;land;land management;customary tenure;statutory tenure;property;land rights;land law;property rights;women";"Land Conflicts;Land & Gender";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
mokoro:5587;Interview with Professor Jose Negrao, Hero of Mozambique’s Poor, about the Land Law;Jose Negrao died on 9 July 2005, aged 49. He was one of the most important intellectuals and researchers in Mozambique, was a leading figure in the Land Campaign and a strong defender of peasant land rights. We publish this interview with him in recognition of and in mourning a great and truly independent fighter who did not conform to what others expected but always pursued his own way. He was hugely influential during the Land Campaign and his success then derived from the fact that people trusted his integrity and his independence. He was greatly appreciated right across Southern Africa and did much to interpret Mozambique to its English speaking neighbours. He was also great fun to be with. He will be deeply missed and his death is a huge loss to Mozambique. The interview questions asked here are: How did you get involved with the Land Law? How was the Land Law disseminated? Were there many obstacles? What are some of the other benefits of the Land Law?;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/interview_with_professor_jose_negrao.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/interview-with-professor-jose-negrao-hero-of-mozambiques-poor-about-the-land-law/;31-07-2005;;;Oxfam America;;en;Reports & Research;"002;MOZ";"land rights;trust;land;research;land law";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Challenges widely held beliefs about land tenure and access in the smallholder sector in Mozambique. Provisions in the new legal framework will not be sufficient to eliminate or adjudicate land conflicts between smallholders. The research results reveal significant variation in the size of household landholdings.

mokoro:6031;No Clear Grounds. The impact of land privatization on smallhold farmers’ food security in Zambia;Land tenure administration in Zambia suffers from serious shortcomings in governance. Too much power is vested with too few checks and balances in too few people, notably the chiefs, local councils and the Commissioner of Lands. This creates fertile ground for abuse and corruption, both of which mar the sector. Zambia still has an important distance to cover in the field of land governance and legal recognition of customary rights and institutions. As investors flock to Zambia’s ‘underutilised’ land, it is necessary to take effective steps to ensure that the rising global demand for food become an opportunity for African farmers and not a threat to them. Appropriate policies and governance measures should be in place for them to access this market and thrive in it.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/NoClearGrounds.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/no-clear-grounds-the-impact-of-land-privatization-on-smallhold-farmers-food-security-in-zambia/;31-03-2014;;;;Peter Tygesen;en;Reports & Research;"ZMB;002";"land;farmers;land governance;land tenure;food security;corruption";Land & Food Security;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:7096;Land Grabbing from within: Learning from Grazing Disputes in Western Kavango, Namibia;Describes a long-standing grazing dispute in northern Namibia that provides critical lessons on the challenges that people living in communal areas face to secure their land rights. Several large livestock owners illegally enclosed community rangelands to secure grazing for their own commercial cattle herds. The communities used legislation to defend their land rights: they mobilised relevant government and traditional authorities to intervene, resulting in a court order for the removal of most of the illegal cattle owners. But the Ministry of Land Reform and the Communal Land Board failed to monitor and follow up on implementation, so the order was never fully enforced and some of the communal grazing land remains illegally enclosed.;http://www.plaas.org.za/sites/default/files/publications-landpdf/PLAAS_ADC%20policy%20brief_Namibia_Web42.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-grabbing-within-learning-grazing-disputes-western-kavango-namibia/;30-06-2015;;International Institute for Environment and Development;International Institute for Environment and Development;Theodor Muduva;en;Reports & Research;"002;NAM";"land;area;land grabbing;land rights;rangelands;land reform;grazing";Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

The current IDRC programme supports 5 action research projects across 10 countries in West, East and Southern Africa. They investigate how to build accountability over land governance. This requires a multi-level strategy at both policy and community level. The most contentious debate was about valuation, benefit-sharing and compensation because compensation almost always fails to take full account of the real value of natural resources in people’s lives. It is often only family elders who gain compensation. Discusses some action strategies and family land grabbing, citing the work of Judy Adoko’s LEMU in Uganda.

mokoro:6032;Gender Equality and land administration: the case of Zambia;Paper discusses Zambia’s dual land tenure system, the ways in which gender issues have been incorporated in legal and policy documents, and the extent to which this has been reflected in practice. It also examines the role of donors in legal and policy processes and donor support to civil society in relation to women’s land rights. Gender and land policies provide for the allocation of land to women, but have little impact on the ground. Customary law is on the whole discriminatory against women, in particular with regard to land ownership. A gender policy and two subsequent land policies have aimed to redress gender inequality by providing for women to be allocated 30% of the land, but this has not been implemented in practice. Laws on inheritance have tried to redress unequal land succession rights, but implementation and enforcement of these laws lag behind.;http://en.diis.dk/en/research/womens-land-rights-in-between-privatization-and-customary-land-rights;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/gender-equality-and-land-administration-the-case-of-zambia/;28-02-2014;;Danish Institute for International Studies;;"Rachel Spichiger;Edna Kabala";en;Reports & Research;"ZMB;002";"land policies;land;customary law;land administration;land tenure;land rights;land ownership;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
mokoro:6069;Ghana’s Land Reform and Gender Equality;In 1999 Ghana engaged in an ambitious land reform process with the adoption of a National Land Policy implemented through a Land Administration Project. The reform aims at strengthening land administration institutions and increasing the security of land tenure for landholders on both customary and state land, but the process is facing multiple challenges, e.g. registration of property still causes problems, malfunctioning agencies and institutions, vesting agency in customary authorities, cultural practices hindering women’s access to land and women experiencing discrimination in the implementation process. Donor support is marked by significant shifts, focusing at first on titling and registration and later on customary institutions. Gender issues at first received little consideration but have increasingly been included in the reform process. Yet gender is still not a central preoccupation of land sector activities. Paper calls for more attention to be paid to the accountability of customary institutions and to the potentially excluding impact of the reform along the lines of gender, ethnicity and social status.;http://en.diis.dk/en/research/gender-equality-concerns-in-ghanas-land-reform;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/ghanas-land-reform-and-gender-equality/;28-02-2014;;Danish Institute for International Studies;;"Rachel Spichiger;Paul Stacey";en;Reports & Research;"002;GHA";"land;land reform;land administration;land tenure;property;women;occupation";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Reviews the reforms in 15 countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia, with a focus on Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Nicaragua. Legislation upholding gender equality is now present in different degrees in most of the countries examined. However, implementation often does not follow suit and women still face discrimination, in part due to social and cultural barriers and the inaccessibility of institutions able to support them.

mokoro:6008;Women, Donors and Land Administration. The Tanzania Case;Tanzania’s land reform from 1999 has been evaluated as among the most gender-sensitive of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. However there is a gap between the legal framework and what is happening on the ground. This paper analyses the challenges related to the protection of women’s rights to land in rural areas. It provides detailed information on reform implementation experiences so far by analysing a number of government and NGO interventions. It discusses the ambiguous role of donors and makes it clear that the fight for women’s rights has not been won just because the legal framework is right. Discriminatory practices persist at formal as well as at customary institutions, disadvantaging women’s access to land. Women’s rights should therefore be mainstreamed into every activity that relates to land, land administration and land dispute settlement.;http://pure.diis.dk/ws/files/55977/WP2013_19_Hundsbaek_Haule_Tanzania_Recom_Wwb.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/women-donors-and-land-administration-the-tanzania-case/;31-12-2013;;Danish Institute for International Studies;;"Rasmus Hundsbaek Pedersen;Scholastica Haule";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;rural areas;area;land dispute;land administration;land reform;women";"Land Conflicts;Land & Gender";Land Use, Management & Investment

Much of the debate concerns how Africa’s rural poor could be affected. The paper assesses the historical experience of three farming models that have figured in recent investments in sub-Saharan Africa: plantations, contract farming and commercial farming areas. Based on a literature review, the paper concentrates on the involvement of, and effects on, rural societies in and around the area where the schemes were located. Looks mainly at sub-Saharan Africa but also considers case studies from Latin America and Asia.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/FAC_Working_Paper_055.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/plantations-contract-farming-and-commercial-farming-areas-in-africa-a-comparative-review/;30-04-2013;;;;Rebecca Smalley;en;Reports & Research;002;"contract farming;area";;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:8548;Gender and Politics in Africa: an interview with Marjorie Mbilinyi;ROAPE’s Janet Bujra questions Marjorie Mbilinyi about her fifty years of campaigning against patriarchal oppression on many fronts in Tanzania. Mbilinyi traces the legitimisation of feminism as a means to understand and a way to organise for and with women. This is not a feminism lifted from Europe or the US, but one generated in response to Tanzanian and African realities. As a teacher, analyst and organiser, Marjorie Mbilinyi has inspired a generation to question patriarchy and to set up groups to study and fight against it collectively, and to do so in tandem with struggles against class oppression, neoliberalism and imperialism. She identifies and describes resistance not only from men in power but also from those who position themselves on the radical Left.

mokoro:5744;Foreword to Women’s Rights to Land & Privatization in Eastern Africa;An exciting new collection inspired by a 2003 Oxfam/FAO workshop in Pretoria. Foreword briefly looks at the struggle for women’s land rights across the globe and the lack of concrete gains. Women have been confronted by resistance and patriarchy. Many land reform programmes over the past 60 years were falsely premised on notions of a unitary household. Women were disadvantaged by the codification of customary law in colonial Africa and are now by privatization in a context exacerbated by the coming of HIV and AIDS, which is breaking down notions of reciprocity. To confront these difficult, sensitive issues requires mobilisation and collective action, awareness raising of rights, addressing gender seriously in all land reform initiatives, political and legal will, and the kind of detailed, local level research so ably represented in this fine, new and well-edited collection from Eastern Africa.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/foreword_womens_rights_to_land_eastern_africa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/foreword-to-womens-rights-to-land-privatization-in-eastern-africa/;30-11-2008;;Mokoro;Mokoro;Robin Palmer;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;customary law;codification;research;land rights;land reform;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5675;Donor and NGO Involvement in Land Issues – some Further Reflections;Reflections based on personal experiences as an academic and as Oxfam’s former Global Land Adviser. Cites a number of institutions on how they conceive of the role of donors in land matters, including the recent DFID policy paper on land, which the author hopes will encourage country level DFID staff to engage. Looks at changing contexts of donor involvement in land issues, including World Bank approaches. Examines contrasting interpretations of the role of NGOs on land issues, stressing that context and history are critical. Contains detailed case study of law making, campaigning, awareness raising and defending a progressive law in Mozambique as an example of some of the complexities of donor and NGO involvement, the importance of individuals, the need for greater donor cooperation and for adopting a long-term approach. Concludes that people who work in the land sector need to be encouraged to exploit the spaces available to them, push out the boundaries of where they find themselves, and make a difference.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/donor_and_ngo_involvement_in_land_issues_leiden.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/donor-and-ngo-involvement-in-land-issues-some-further-reflections/;30-09-2007;;Mokoro;Mokoro;Robin Palmer;en;Reports & Research;002;"boundaries;land";;Land Use, Management & Investment

mokoro:5475;Thoughts on the Latest (March 2003) World Bank Land PRR;Originally verbal presentation to World Bank meeting reviewing its Policy Research Report on land. Argues the need for this to be honest, open to admitting past mistakes, and pro-poor in order to influence future Bank policy and practice at national level. Argues that the Bank needs to be aware that many people across the world view it as the enemy because of past historical experience. Need for various Bank policies to be mutually compatible. Cites source suggesting great divergence between policy drivers within the Bank. Generally welcomes more nuanced and self-critical approach of this draft, but concludes that all the pro-poor land reform, laws and policies in the world will be of limited value for as long as international trade rules and subsidies remain rigged in favour of the rich.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/thoughts_on_latest_wb_land_prr.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/thoughts-on-the-latest-march-2003-world-bank-land-prr/;31-03-2003;;Oxfam Great Britain;Oxfam Great Britain;Robin Palmer;en;Reports & Research;002;"land reform;land;research";;

The independence compromises forced on Zimbabwe (and Namibia and South Africa) implied the legitimation of a century and more of past white land grabbing which could only be changed with the consent of the beneficiaries of this past expropriation. But Mugabe has now torn up the old rules of the game and let the genie of redistribution out of the bottle, earning himself much popular support elsewhere in Africa and causing alarm to many governments and a hasty revision of existing plans for land reform.

mokoro:5506;A Rich Man’s Hobby;Argues that the price of commercial farmland in Namibia is high in relation to the profits that can be made from commercial livestock farming. As a result, farming is rapidly becoming the preserve of the urban rich who farm as a lifestyle choice and are prepared to subsidise their farms from their principal sources of income. Government policy is trying to encourage black Namibians into commercial farming through the Affirmative Action Loans scheme. However, given the price of land, many of these farmers will struggle to create commercially viable farms. This is bound to cause frustration further down the road and new farmers will start to demand more subsidies to purchase farms and diversify into other activities that will allow them to raise their incomes. Government will then have to decide whether to increase subsidies to encourage broader land ownership or simply allow those who can afford to farm to benefit from land reform.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rich_mans_hobby.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/a-rich-mans-hobby/;31-12-2003;;;;Robin Sherbourne;en;Reports & Research;002;"land reform;land;farmland;land ownership;farmers";;Land Use, Management & Investment

The current status quo is unsustainable and the national effort inadequate. The private sector has a key role to play to break the current logjam. Increasing number of landowners are beginning to see the light and accept political realities. Calls for a land summit to negotiate a comprehensive agrarian transformation.

mokoro:5602;Consensus, Confusion, and Controversy: Selected Land Reform Issues in Sub-Saharan Africa;Paper targeted at land reform practitioners and stakeholders in government and civil society. Argues that land reform can broadly be divided into land tenure reform and land redistribution. First chapter gives short narrative of key land tenure and land policy issues. These remain politically sensitive, but consensus is emerging on how to deal with them once confusion surrounding private /common property and formal / informal rights is cleared up. Secure property rights should not be confused with full private ’ownership’. The introduction of private title in situations where favourable economic conditions do not exist can be a waste of effort. Second chapter addresses redistribution of property rights from large to small farmers. There is heightened urgency on the need to address this, especially in Southern Africa, but controversy exists on appropriate implementation mechanisms which, combined with the sensitive political nature of land reform, often results in costly inaction. Highlights case of South Africa, because success there would have tremendous regional and international implications for land redistribution. A policy framework for redistributive land reform is outlined within which competing paradigms compete on the ground. Believes major land redistribution can be implemented peacefully, that history need not repeat itself.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/selected_land_reform_issues_in_ssa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/consensus-confusion-and-controversy-selected-land-reform-issues-in-sub-saharan-africa/;31-01-2006;;;;"Rogier van den Brink;Glen Thomas;Hans Binswanger;John Bruce;Frank Byamugisha";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;waste;farmers;land tenure;property;property rights;common property;land reform";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5772;Another Countryside? Policy options for land and agrarian reform in South Africa;This book is a compilation of 11 papers that explore the limits of the current approach to land redistribution in South Africa and propose policy alternatives. Centres on 3 themes: how land is to be acquired (which land, and for whom), under what tenure arrangements it is to be held, and how production is to be supported. Focus moves beyond debating alternatives to the ‘willing-buyer, willing-seller’ paradigm to the kind of agrarian change that land reform should pursue. Central to all is reconfiguring the roles of state and market.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/another-countryside;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/another-countryside-policy-options-for-land-and-agrarian-reform-in-south-africa/;30-06-2009;;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Ruth Hall;en;Reports & Research;"ZAF;002";"land;agrarian reform;land reform";;
mokoro:5550;Budgeting for land reform;The primary purpose of land reform in South Africa is to redistribute agricultural and other land to address the racially skewed pattern of landholding and promote development. Slow progress in land reform over the past decade underscores the urgency of finding ways to accelerate the process. The state has adopted a market-assisted approach to redistribution. This means that land is usually bought at full market price. In addition, substantial funding is needed for the implementation of the programme and for post-settlement support to beneficiaries. The budget allocated to land reform is therefore of central importance to the programme. Surveys trends in the land reform budget over the past decade, with particular emphasis on redistribution.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/PB13;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/budgeting-for-land-reform/;31-08-2004;;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;"Ruth Hall;Edward Lahiff";en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land reform";;

mokoro:5532;A Political Economy of Land Reform in South Africa;Land reform is one way in which the ‘new’ South Africa set out to redress the injustices of apartheid and, by redistributing land to black South Africans, to transform the structural basis of racial inequality. During the first decade of democracy, land reform has fallen far short of both public expectations and official targets. This article describes the progress of the programme and its changing nature. It is argued that a recent shift in land policy, from a focus on the rural poor to ‘emerging’ black commercial farmers, is consistent with changes in macro-economic policy and reflects shifting class alliances. The programme now appears to pursue a limited deracialisation of the commercial farming areas rather than a process of agrarian restructuring. Most fundamentally, land reform has not yet provided a strategy to overcome agrarian dualism.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/pol_econ_land_reform_sa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/a-political-economy-of-land-reform-in-south-africa/;30-06-2004;;;;Ruth Hall;en;Reports & Research;"ZAF;002";"area;land;farmers;land reform";;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:5718;Decentralization, Pro-Poor Land Policies, and Democratic Governance;Land tenure reform policy has been affected by many different types of decentralization, but the literature has rarely explicitly addressed the implications of this. The paper provides a review of how the issues of decentralization are linked to land tenure reform in theory and practice. Begins with clarifying some key terms, then looks at contending perspectives on decentralization and how these relate to the UNDP’s pillars of democratic governance. Reviews the different types of land tenure reform in terms of the role of centralized and decentralized institutions, illustrating strengths and weaknesses, gaps and challenges with experience from a range of developing countries. Turns to conclusions and policy recommendations, considering how decentralized approaches to land tenure reform can contribute to goals such as gender equity, social cohesion, human rights, and the identity of indigenous peoples.;http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/44353/2/capriwp80.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/decentralization-pro-poor-land-policies-and-democratic-governance/;30-06-2008;;;;"Ruth Meinzen-Dick;Monica Di Gregorio;Stephan Dohrn";en;Reports & Research;002;"decentralization;land policies;land;land tenure;indigenous peoples";Indigenous & Community Land Rights;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5699;Liberalisation and the Debates on Women’s Access to Land;The reform of land tenure institutions is now back on the national and global policy agendas. While at a certain level of generality the principle of gender equality in access to resources, including land, has been endorsed by a diverse range of policy actors, there are many tensions and ambiguities likely to obstruct women’s effective access to land and its contribution to decent livelihoods. There are important questions about liberalisation policies vis-a-vis land, given the well documented difficulties that low-income women in particular face in accessing land through markets. Moreover, access to land can only play a complementary role in women’s (and men’s) livelihoods, and one that needs to be matched by income from employment. But many developing countries today confront formidable barriers to industrialisation and employment generation. There are also troubling implications from a gender perspective in the current endorsement of ‘customary’ systems of land tenure and decentralisation of land management. Women’s rights advocates fear that this can play into the hands of powerful interest groups hostile to women’s rights.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436590701637342;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/liberalisation-and-the-debates-on-womens-access-to-land/;31-12-2007;;;;Shahra Razavi;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land tenure;land management;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Conflicts over resources will be exacerbated by decentralisation. Conflicts between indigenous and outsider communities are now widespread.

Provides a micro-level foundation for discussions of land allocation and its relation to poverty within the smallholder sector of Eastern and Southern Africa based on results from household surveys in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique and Rwanda between 1990 and 2000. Addresses (1) why geographically based targeted approaches to poverty reduction are likely to miss a significant share of the poor, (2) why agricultural growth alone is not likely to be a sufficient engine for directly lifting a significant share of small-scale farmers out of poverty, (3) why agri-food productivity growth is needed to create a more dynamic and diversified rural economy, (4) why increased access to land is likely to affect significantly the poverty-reducing effects of agricultural growth. Concludes with implications for the design of poverty reduction strategies.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/smallholder_income_land_dist_africa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/smallholder-income-and-land-distribution-in-africa-implications-for-poverty-reduction-strategies/;31-08-2002;;USAID;;"T.S.

Results are drawn from nationally representative households in five countries between 1990 and 2000: Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Rwanda. Addresses (1) why geographically based poverty reduction or targeting strategies is likely to miss a significant share of the poor, (2) why current enthusiasm for community driven development approaches will require serious attention to how resources are allocated at local levels, (3) why sustained income growth for the poorest strata of the rural population will depend on agricultural growth in most countries, (4) why agricultural productivity growth is likely to offer the best potential for pulling the poorest and land constrained households out of poverty, (5) why meaningful poverty alleviation strategies in many countries will require fundamental changes to make land more accessible to smallholder farmers.;http://mokoro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/smallholder_income_land_distribution_africa.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/smallholder-income-and-land-distribution-in-africa-implications-for-poverty-reduction-strategies-2/;12-31-2001;;;;"T.S.

The large-scale acquisition of land for agriculture and conservation projects often displace local communities or reduce their access to control and ownership of key resources due to the gaps between good legislation and inadequate implementation and enforcement. Policy makers, civil society organisations and communal land administering institutions need to do more to raise awareness among rural communities of land rights and governance requirements and ensure that all land-based investments follow the procedures laid down in Namibian laws and that they comply with regional and international voluntary guidelines on land tenure.;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publications/pb39-adc-namibia#sthash.grjg2WaI.b8WqlDIL.dpuf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/understanding-land-acquisitions-in-namibias-communal-land-impacts-and-policy-implications/;30-11-2015;;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;Legal Assistance Centre;Theodor Muduva;en;Reports & Research;"002;NAM";"land;land tenure;land acquisitions;land rights;land allocation;scale;land reform;agriculture";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Highlights tensions between these three sets of land tenure institutions – state ownership, ethnic federalism and neo-customary tenure – and their implications for minority land rights. A case study of land-based conflict in Oromiya region, based on fieldwork conducted in 2009-10, demonstrates the continuing relevance of these land tenure institutions and associated ideas in land debates in Ethiopia, both in terms of the use of these ideas by protagonists as means of justifying land claims, and the ambiguous state response to the conflict, which goes well beyond the provisions of the land policy. Many of the key issues regarding ethnicity and land mirror debates taking place across the continent.;https://academic.oup.com/afraf/advance-article/doi/10.1093/afraf/ady010/4956426;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/responding-to-land-based-conflict-in-ethiopia-the-land-rights-of-ethnic-minorities-under-federalism/;30-04-2018;African Affairs;;University of Manchester;Tom Lavers;en;Reports & Research;"002;ETH";"land rights;land tenure;customary tenure;land";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5995;"Conflicting Priorities in the Promotion of Gender Equality in Ethiopia; Uneven Implementation of Land Registration and the Impact on Women’s Land Rights";The current Ethiopian government originated in a Marxist revolutionary movement, which early in its struggle against the Derg regime recognized the widespread discrimination against women in Ethiopian society and placed gender emancipation at the centre of its revolutionary strategy. While political expediency and confrontation with patriarchal Ethiopian society has at times challenged its commitment to women, the EPRDF has introduced a number of reforms which aim to promote gender equality, including recognition of equality between men and women in land rights, and a land registration programme that requires the names of both husbands and wives on certificates. Examines the gendered impacts of these reforms through analysis of three village-level case studies based on fieldwork in 2009-2010. The cases highlight the contingent nature of gender outcomes based on local state-society relations, and the government’s political and economic priorities, resulting in considerable variation within Ethiopia.;http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/%28httpPublications%29/0FCD3F61C1C8E276C1257C83005D4301?OpenDocument;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/conflicting-priorities-in-the-promotion-of-gender-equality-in-ethiopia-uneven-implementation-of-land-registration-and-the-impact-on-womens-land-rights/;28-02-2014;;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development;;Tom Lavers;en;Reports & Research;"002;ETH";"land;reforms;land rights;land registration;women";Land & Gender;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:6025;The Gendered Nature of Land and Property Rights in post-Reform Rwanda;Rwanda has provided a picture of promising change for improving gender equalities in land rights. This report draws upon extensive qualitative field research in 20 sectors of Rwanda to examine the current state of gendered rights to land in practice. Among Rwandan communities, there is now widespread knowledge of laws granting gender-equal rights. More and more women are receiving inheritance and inter-vivos gifts and are increasingly receiving these in equal shares, while formally married women are exercising greater decision-making power over land held jointly with their husbands. Nevertheless, women in Rwanda still experience several challenges in accessing land and controlling the land that they do have access to. Women continue to lack the necessary bargaining power to claim inheritance and parental gifts of land and to exercise decision-making over land on par with men. Access to unbiased forums for resolving land disputes continues to be a challenge for many women, often dissuading them from claiming their rights. The report concludes with a series of recommendations on how to address remaining gaps and improve women’s rights to land, recommendations that not only extend to policy and law, but also to programs and other investments designed to foster gender justice in Rwanda.;http://rwandaland.org/en/landprojectreports/item/89-the-gendered-nature-of-land-and-property-rights-in-post-reform-rwand;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/the-gendered-nature-of-land-and-property-rights-in-post-reform-rwanda/;30-04-2014;;;USAID ;USAID LAND Project;en;Reports & Research;002;"property rights;land dispute;land rights;research;land;property;women";"Land Conflicts;Land & Gender";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

mokoro:5847;Securing and regulating land tenure: putting the issues before the tools. Some of the obstacles to coherent policies;Most West African countries are in the process of reforming their land policies. Discussions tend to focus on the tools and mechanisms for securing and regulating land tenure. While tools are certainly a vital part of the process, it is important to understand that the same tool can serve very different interests depending on how it is conceived and used. Are we sufficiently aware of the diversity of issues that may be associated with a land policy?

Land-based investments have shown that deals often lead to conflicts between investors and local populations, which negatively effects local livelihoods and food security. A main issue in these conflicts is the lack of information at and knowledge about the local level. Hence the project aimed to bring different stakeholders together, improve the quality and flow of information between these actors, and generate new ideas for creating shared value. Over the course of one year, SVF conducted in-depth, local research, organized multi-stakeholder meetings and conducted follow-up activities for implementation and monitoring.

mokoro:9018;The Scramble for Land Rights. Reducing Inequality between Communities and Companies;Indigenous and community lands, crucial for rural livelihoods, are typically held under informal customary arrangements. This can leave the land vulnerable to outside commercial interests, so communities may seek to formalize their land rights in a government registry and obtain an official land document. But this process is often time-consuming, complex and costly and, in contrast, companies can acquire land relatively quickly and find short-cuts around regulatory burdens. Report maps these inequities in 15 countries (including Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda) and offers recommendations on how to level the playing field.;http://www.wri.org/publication/scramble-for-land-rights?utm_campaign=wrigovernance&utm_source=ScrambleForLandRightsLaunch-2018-07-11&utm_medium=email&utm_content=text;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/the-scramble-for-land-rights-reducing-inequality-between-communities-and-companies/;31-07-2018;;World Resources Institute;World Resources Institute;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land rights;land";;Access to Land & Tenure Security
mokoro:8959;Failed farmland deals: a growing legacy of disaster and pain;GRAIN has documented at least 135 farmland deals for food crop production that have backfired between 2007 and 2017. They represent 17.5 million hectares. These are not failed land grabs, since the land almost never goes back to the communities, but failed agribusiness projects. While higher standards of due diligence and stronger forms of liability are surely needed, the real challenge is to get the land back to the communities. No one should rest until that is achieved. The enormity and number of these failed farmland deals tell us that they should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. Investment is needed in policies and initiatives to support food production by local communities, not opening the doors to agribusiness.;https://farmlandgrab.org/post/view/28205;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/failed-farmland-deals-a-growing-legacy-of-disaster-and-pain/;30-06-2018;;GRAIN;GRAIN;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land deals;farmland;land grabs;land";Land & Investments;Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:9019;High Risk in the Rainforest: Golden Agri-Resources and Golden Veroleum’s Palm Oil Project in Liberia;Report shows that Dutch-based banks continue to finance deforestation and land grabbing in Liberia. Thousands have lost their homes, local communities have been intimidated or imprisoned, and large swathes of forest have been cleared or burnt down. Milieudefensie argues that it is time for the banks to fulfil their sustainable banking promises, and to withdraw their investments in the industrial palm oil sector as soon as possible.;https://en.milieudefensie.nl/news/dutch-based-banks-continue-to-finance-deforestation-and-land-grabbing;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/high-risk-in-the-rainforest-golden-agri-resources-and-golden-veroleums-palm-oil-project-in-liberia/;31-07-2018;;Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands);Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands);;en;Reports & Research;"002;LBR";"deforestation;land;land grabbing";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment
mokoro:8906;Women, Land and Corruption: Resources for Practitioners and Policy-Makers;Despite increasing attention in recent years, little evidence has been available on the issue of women, land and corruption in Africa to inform effective policy-making. There has been no compilation of relevant background information, lessons learnt and approaches to tackling land corruption as it affects women. This publication aims to address that gap, providing practitioners and decision-makers with a compendium of research findings, contextual information and practical solutions to help fulfil women’s land rights. It presents specifically gendered evidence on how women are affected by land corruption differently from men, followed by responses tailored to women’s needs to address gender-based inequalities over land. Covers Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zimbabwe.;https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/women_land_and_corruption_resources_for_practitioners_and_policy_makers;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/women-land-and-corruption-resources-for-practitioners-and-policy-makers/;31-03-2018;;Transparency International;Transparency International;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land rights;land;corruption;research;women";Land & Gender;Access to Land & Tenure Security
mokoro:8914;Land and Water Grabbing. A Discussion of Integrity Implications and Related Risks;Examines the link between land and water grabbing, the people that are most impacted by this, and legal frameworks related to both land and water rights. Describes the impacts of land and water grabbing in Kenya and Ethiopia. Examines integrity risks in the Ethiopian government’s leasing of land and water resources to foreign investors, and the land reform process in Kenya after the launch of the 2010 Kenyan Constitution. This summary document identifies how powerful actors are taking control of land and water resources at the expense of poorer, local communities. Corruption in land governance plays a huge role in land grabbing, and integrity risks manifest through bribes, flawed decision-making processes, circumventing official procedures, and institutional fragmentation.;http://www.waterintegritynetwork.net/2018/04/06/seizing-land-vital-resource-water/;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/land-and-water-grabbing-a-discussion-of-integrity-implications-and-related-risks/;30-04-2018;;Water Integrity Network;Water Integrity Network;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land;land governance;land grabbing;water rights;land reform;corruption";;Access to Land & Tenure Security
mokoro:8905;Legislative Best Practices for Securing Women’s Rights to Community Lands;Brief highlights key attributes of national constitutions, laws, and regulations that play a fundamental role in protecting indigenous and rural women’s rights to community forests and other community lands. These legislative best practices were derived from a 2017 analysis of over 400 national laws and regulations, Power and Potential, which evaluates the extent to which women’s rights to community forests are recognized by national law in 30 low- and middle-income countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.;https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Legislative-Best-Practices-Brief_RRI_Mar-2018.pdf;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/legislative-best-practices-for-securing-womens-rights-to-community-lands/;31-03-2018;;Rights and Resources Initiative;Rights and Resources Initiative;;en;Reports & Research;002;"land law;land policies;gender equity in access to land;women;community lands;community land rights;land access";Land & Gender;Access to Land & Tenure Security
mokoro:8845;A Fair Share for Women: Toward More Equitable Land Compensation and Resettlement in Tanzania and Mozambique;Women disproportionately bear the negative impacts of large-scale land investments (in agribusiness, extractives, logging) in the global South. Lack of formal land rights and their subordinate role in the household and community lead to their marginalization in decision-making processes and the bypassing of them in the distribution of compensation and the planning and implementation of resettlement.  In Tanzania and Mozambique, laws require community consultations and the payment of compensation to affected local communities, but they fail to adequately account for women’s concerns and perspectives. There are many gaps in the legal frameworks. Women are underrepresented in decision-making bodies, and laws lack mechanisms to ensure meaningful participation in community consultation and consent processes.;http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/a-fair-share-for-women.pdf ;http://mokoro.co.uk/land-rights-article/a-fair-share-for-women-toward-more-equitable-land-compensation-and-resettlement-in-tanzania-and-mozambique/;31-03-2018;;World Resources Institute;World Resources Institute;;en;Reports & Research;"TZA;002;MOZ";"scale;land investments;compensation;land;land rights;women";"Land & Investments;Land & Gender";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"
