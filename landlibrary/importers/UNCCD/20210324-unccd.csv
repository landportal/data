"UNCCD:255";"Stronger UNCCD for a land-degradation neutral world. Issue brief";"";"Land-degradation neutral world is an aspirational goal, which was agreed at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012. To achieve this goal, land degradation should be avoided and for every hectare of degraded land a hectare of land should be restored preferably in the same ecosystem and landscape. A land-degradation neutral world is a prerequisite for assuring water, food and energy security, alleviating poverty and mitigating climate change. 
​​
At the Rio+20 Conference, world leaders recognized land degradation, desertification and drought as serious global challenges,  impeding sustainable development globally and committed to “strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world”. They also reaffirmed their resolve under the UNCCD to take coordinated action nationally, regionally and internationally, to monitor land degradation globally and further develop and implement scientifically based and socially inclusive indicators for monitoring and assessing the extent of desertification, land degradation and drought.";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2013-12-31";"en";"deforestation;land degradation;migration";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Forest Tenure;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/255";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/225_Stronger_UNCCD_LDNWorld_web.pdf";"";"";"";"15";"";""

Each year 12 million hectares (ha)are lost to deserts.That is enough land to grow 20 million tonnes of grain.
Land degradation,in turn,threatens the livelihoods of a billion of earth ’s inhabitants.Degradation caused by overcultivation, overgrazing, deforestation and inefficient irrigation affects an estimated 20%of the world ’s drylands, an area as large as China.
Combating desertification,and land degradation more generally, is a war that can be lost,but must be won.Desertification is often the result of human activity and can therefore be prevented or controlled by human effort. Because of its magnitude,desertification is a global issue,and as such can only be addressed through a global partnership.This brochure is about the formation of such a partnership between the Global Environment Facility (GEF)and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).";"";"Global Environment Facility;International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"Global Environment Facility";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2001-12-31";"en";"deforestation;drylands";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Forest Tenure;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/272";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/272_Tackling_ Land_Degradation_Desertification.pdf";"";"";"";"9";"";""

Even though REDD is still under discussion within the UNFCCC framework, many REDD pilot projects are being implemented across the tropics.

"UNCCD:666";"Bioenergy and sustainability: Bridging the gaps";"";"The  development  of  modern  high  efficiency  bioenergy technologies  has  the  potential to improve energy security and access while reducing environmental impacts and  stimulating  low-carbon  development.  While  modern  bioenergy  production  is increasing in the world, it still makes a small contribution to our energy matrix.
At present, approximately 87% of energy demand is satisfied by energy produced  through consumption of fossil fuels. Although the International Energy Agency (IEA)  predicts that this share will fall to 75%, the total consumption of fossil fuels will continue to rise, adding another 6 Gt of carbon to the atmosphere by 2035. The consequences of this increase are worrisome.
Deforestation  and  land  degradation  also  contribute  to  increased  greenhouse  gas emissions.  The  world’s  total  forest  area  in  2010  was  just  over  4  billion  hectares, which corresponds to an average of 0.6 ha per capita.  Each year, between 2000 and 2010, around 13 million hectares of forestland were converted to other uses or lost through natural causes. The production of timber for housing or the need to make land 
available for urbanization, large-scale cash crops such as soy and oil palm, subsistence 
agriculture  and  cattle  ranching  induce  deforestation.  Forests  are  also  degraded  or damaged due to the soaring demand for fuelwood and charcoal for cooking and heating in developing countries that suffer from low levels of access to modern energy services. 
Most of the world’s bioenergy is presently derived from wood burning for cooking and heating in developing countries. Such traditional uses of biomass are low in cost to the users, but their technical inefficiency results in considerable health and environmental costs while providing only low quality energy services.";"Souza, Glaucia M

"UNCCD:667";"Land and Bioenergy  (Chapter 9 from ""Bioenergy and sustainability: Bridging the gaps"")";"";"Projected land demands for bioenergy fall well within conservative estimates of current and future land availability (240 to 905 Mha). Estimates for the amount of modern bioenergy needed to meaningfully mitigate climate change range from 80   to 200 EJ in the 2050 timeframe. At the upper end of this range, we estimate 
that about 200 million hectares would be required. This may be compared to most estimates for the amount of land available for bioenergy, which exceed 500 million hectares. Long before the world reaches any significant fraction of 200 Mha devoted to modern bioenergy, we will have opportunity to be guided by experience rather than projection. The real danger is not that once the bioenergy genie is out of the 
bottle that ruinous land use change will ensue. The recent application of the brakes to  bioenergy  expansion  worldwide  provides  ample  evidence  that  the  growth  of bioenergy can be curtailed. Rather, the real danger is that bioenergy development will proceed so slowly that a key strategy for climate change mitigation will be taken off the table. In this chapter we address the questions of whether and how enough biomass could 
be produced to make a material contribution to global energy supply on a scale and timeline that is consistent with prominent low carbon energy scenarios. We assess whether  bioenergy  provision  necessarily  conflicts  with  priority  ecosystem  services including food security for the world’s poor and vulnerable populations.
In order to evaluate the potential land demand for bioenergy, we developed a set of  three illustrative scenarios using specified growth rates for each bioenergy sub-sector.";"Woods, Jeremy

LAC has experienced important changes in land use. When the Europeans arrived in the 15th century, the forest cover of LAC accounted for approximately 75 per cent of the territory. At present, forests cover less than 50 per cent of the territory, 90 per cent of which is due to the expansion of agriculture and livestock, especially during the 20th century and the
beginning of the 21st century.

In LAC, the primary factors that have contributed to land degradation are population growth, deforestation and the management of grassland ecosystems (savannas, steppes, pampas, fields, etc.), as well as natural phenomena exacerbated or not by human action. As land degradation progresses, soil, hydrology, biomass, biodiversity and climate are all adversely affected. Regarding the factors that affect degradation, an analysis was carried out in eight LAC countries, considering six factors, as well as their concurrence and convergence in a certain geographical space, and their evolution in a certain period of time.

"UNCCD:1277";"Zero deforestation: A commitment to change";"";"Widespread palm oil production causes much controversy due to its negative impacts in the tropics. But whatever is said about it, it is big business and getting bigger by the day due to increasing global demands. Alongside this, the size and depth of the social and environmental debates surrounding palm oil production are also growing. As a major globally-consumed commodity, its production in the humid and sub-humid tropics raises concerns due to its impacts on the environment, biodiversity, local communities, smallholder livelihoods, land rights and climate change.

One possible solution proposed is to improve the ‘inclusiveness’ of smallholders who make up a substantial part of the palm oil value chain. This book presents potential opportunities by looking at the experiences, perceptions and perspectives of individuals, companies, institutions and NGOs on what has been done and is being done on the ground to increase the involvement of and benefits to smallholder oil palm farmers. And in doing so, it focuses on the following key questions: How do such actions and their impacts differ between different smallholder types and organizations? How do they differ between countries, regions and corporate contexts? What are the effects of various enabling policy environments? And what do the authors in this edition mean by ‘inclusiveness’?

This ETFRN News edition brings together 24 articles and interviews from around the world that reflect on these questions and it identifies means of improving smallholder inclusiveness in palm oil production and the ones that could be scaled up.";"Pasiecznik, Nick

"UNCCD:1481";"Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020";"";"Did you know that forests cover nearly 1/3 of land globally?
That’s 4.06 billion hectares.
In other words, there is around 0.52 ha of forest for every person on the planet.

More than half (54 percent) of the world’s forests are in only five countries –the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China.

Ninety-three percent of the forest area worldwide is composed of naturally regenerating forests and 7 percent is planted.

The area of naturally regenerating forests has decreased since 1990 (at a declining rate of loss), but the area of planted forests has increased by 123 million ha.

Plantation forests cover about 131 million ha, which is 3 percent of the global forest area and 45 percent of the total area of planted forests.

The highest share of plantation forest is in South America with 99 percent of the total planted-forest area and 2 percent of the total forest area.
The lowest share of plantation forest is in Europe, where it represents 6 percent of the planted forest estate and 0.4 percent of the total forest area.

Globally, 44 percent of plantation forests are composed mainly of introduced species.
The world still has at least 1.11 billion ha of primary forest. Combined, three countries – Brazil, Canada and the Russian Federation – host more than half (61 percent) of the world’s primary forest. 

The area of primary forest has decreased by 81 million ha since 1990, but the rate of loss more than halved in 2010–2020 compared with the previous decade.
Where is forest being lost and where is it being gained?
•	Africa had the largest annual rate of net forest loss in 2010–2020, at 3.9 million ha.
•	The rate of net forest loss has increased in Africa in each of the three decades since 1990. 
•	Annually South America had a net forest loss of 2.6 million ha in 2010–2020.
•	The rate of net forest loss has declined substantially in South America, to about half the rate in 2010–2020 compared with 2000–2010.
•	Asia had the highest net gain of forest area in 2010–2020.
•	Oceania experienced net losses of forest area in the decades 1990–2000 and 2000–2010.

The rate of net forest loss declined from 7.8 million ha per year in the decade 1990–2000 to 5.2 million ha in 2000–2010 and 4.7 million ha per year in 2010–2020. The rate of decline of net forest loss slowed in the most recent decade due to a reduction in the rate of forest expansion.

An estimated 420 million ha of forest has been lost worldwide through deforestation since 1990, but the rate of forest loss has declined substantially. In the most recent five-year period (2015–2020), the annual rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million ha, down from 12 million ha in 2010–2015.

Forests face many disturbances that can adversely affect their health and vitality and reduce their ability to provide a full range of goods and ecosystem services.
About 98 million ha of forest were affected by fire in 2015*; this was mainly in the tropical domain, where fire burned about 4 percent of the total forest area in that year. More than two-thirds of the total forest area affected was in Africa and South America.
Insects, diseases and severe weather events damaged about 40 million ha of forests in 2015, mainly in the temperate and boreal domains.

There is an estimated 726 million ha of forest in protected areas worldwide. The area of forest in protected areas globally has increased by 191 million ha since 1990. South America has the highest share of forests in protected areas, at 31 percent.
Most of the forests in Europe have management plans; on the other hand, management plans exist for less than 25 percent of forests in Africa and less than 20 percent in South America.
The area of forest under management plans is increasing in all regions – globally, it has increased by 233 million ha since 2000, reaching 2.05 billion ha in 2020.

Seventy-three percent of the world’s forests is under public ownership,* 22 percent is privately owned, and the ownership of the remainder is categorized as either ‘unknown’ or ‘other’ (mainly comprising forests where ownership is disputed or in transition). 
Public ownership is predominant in all world regions and most subregions. Of the regions, Oceania, North and Central America and South America have the highest proportions of private forests.

Globally, the share of publicly owned forests has decreased since 1990 and the area of forest under private ownership has increased.
An estimated 399 million ha of forest is designated primarily for the protection of soil and water, an increase of 119 million ha since 1990. The rate of increase in the area of forest allocated for this purpose has grown over the entire period but especially in the last ten years.
About ten percent of the world’s forests is allocated for biodiversity conservation 

Globally, 424 million ha of forest is designated primarily for biodiversity conservation. In total, 111 million ha has been so designated since 1990, of which the largest part was allocated between 2000 and 2010. 
The rate of increase in the area of forest designated primarily for biodiversity conservation has slowed in the last ten years.

About 30 percent of all forests is used primarily for production
Globally, about 1.15 billion ha of forest is managed primarily for the production of wood and non-wood forest products. In addition, 749 million ha is designated for multiple use, which often includes production. 

Worldwide, the area of forest designated primarily for production has remained relatively stable but the area of multiple-use forest has decreased by about 71 million ha since 1990. 

More than 180 million ha of forest is used mainly for social services
An area of 186 million ha of forest worldwide is allocated for social services such as recreation, tourism, education research and the conservation of cultural and spiritual sites. The area designated for this forest use has increased at a rate of 186 000 ha per year since 2010.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"deforestation;forestry";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Forest Tenure;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1481";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1481_Global_forest_resources_assessment_FAO_2020_CA8753EN.pdf";"";"";"";"16";"";""
"UNCCD:1573";"Road to Restoration. A Guide to Identifying Priorities and Indicators for Monitoring Forest and Landscape Restoration";"";"By declaring the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the UN has recognized that there are only 10 years left to restore the world's degraded land. Countries are striving to fight climate change by 2030 through their Paris Agreement commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But in many cases, their climate and development agenda are disconnected, even though sustainability and development go hand in hand – especially for rural communities.

The divide is particularly severe when it comes to restoring degraded land. We know that restoring land can boost crop yields and income for farmers, improve access to water, enable people to stay on their ancestral land, and help communities adapt to the changing climate. But with so many competing uses of the land, it is difficult to focus restoration efforts where they can help communities most effectively overcome climate change and rural poverty, while also halting deforestation and protecting vital biodiversity.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WRI have created a new guide, The Road to Restoration, to help governments, businesses, communities and anyone actively restoring land identify priorities and set up goals grounded in reality. Using real data, they can create systems that support and keep track of their efforts. By measuring progress, countries like El Salvador, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi have followed the road to restoration to craft customized and implementable strategies to fight climate change and rural poverty.

The tool guides users through basic questions about the process to restore land: Why is restoration needed in the first place? What will the restored land be used for? What are the barriers that could prevent sustainability (including drivers of degradation and enabling factors)? What are the constraints and priorities for monitoring restoration?

These questions help people establish goals, identify quantitative data, and track progress.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);World Resources Institute";"World Resources Institute";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2019-12-31";"en";"agroforestry systems;community forestry;deforestation;forestry;land degradation;land restoration";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1573";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1573_road-to-restoration.pdf";"";"";"";"78";"";""
"UNCCD:1577";"Survey of GHG mitigation policies for the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector";"";"In light of the urgency for policy action to address climate change, this report provides the first detailed global catalogue of targets and policies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. It covers 20 countries which collectively account for nearly half of the world’s AFOLU emissions. Most of these countries have recently set targets within their AFOLU sector as part of national climate mitigation strategies and commitments, although these targets are only legally-binding for two countries. However, policies to incentivise emission reductions and achieve these targets still need to be developed. Consequently, policy efforts will need to intensify for the AFOLU sector to contribute effectively to limiting global temperature increases to well below 2°C, and especially to meet the more ambitious 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement.

This report provides a survey of targets and policies for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector for twenty countries. These countries cover six global regions: Europe (France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the European Union), North America (Canada, the United States), South America (Brazil), Oceania (Australia, New Zealand), East and South East Asia (The People’s Republic of China ‒ henceforth “China” ‒, Indonesia), and Sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Benin, Burundi, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Gambia). Within each of the global regions, countries were selected based on a combination of their regional contribution to Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) emissions, and the progress they have made in introducing policies or commitments to reduce these emissions. In 2016, these countries accounted for close to half of the world’s AFOLU emissions, with 42% of global emissions from agriculture and 50% of global Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions (a GHG emission inventory category that corresponds to the FOLU component of AFOLU). 

National ambitions and commitments to mitigate AFOLU emissions vary markedly among the countries surveyed. While all of the countries covered in this report commit to national-level GHG emissions reductions in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), communicated to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the Paris Agreement, only Indonesia and the surveyed African countries pledge specific mitigation targets for AFOLU emissions in their NDCs. While the setting of sector specific targets in NDCs is important, most of the surveyed countries have also put mitigation policy frameworks or strategies in place to support their NDCs, many of which set targets for AFOLU emissions. More specifically:   Mitigation targets in OECD countries are more common for agriculture than LULUCF. Where targets for agriculture have been defined, they are typically lower than the percentage reductions in global emissions needed from the sector to stabilise global temperatures at 2oC, according to findings from multi-sector integrated assessment models. New Zealand and Ireland are presently the only countries with legally binding mitigation targets in agriculture.  The surveyed non-OECD countries that pledged sector-specific targets, tend to have more ambitious mitigation targets for AFOLU than OECD countries, which are conditional on external financial support. The few unconditional targets pledged by non-OECD countries are, by contrast, small in percentage terms. 

Where they have been developed, national mitigation strategies and frameworks provide some details about mitigation policies. Challenges for measuring AFOLU emissions, which are mainly from diffuse heterogeneous sources, have been an obstacle for the implementation of mitigation policies in the sector. Progress is however being made on the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions at both sector and landholder scales. 
Among the mitigation policies in AFOLU that have been implemented, there are very few examples of national-level market-based instruments to incentivise the mitigation of the major emission sources in the sector. All national policies that apply the “polluter pays principle” via market-based instruments, such as carbon taxes or emission permits, presently exclude AFOLU, with the exception of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), which includes the forestry sector. The pricing of farm-level emissions in New Zealand is also scheduled for implementation in 2025. In readiness for this, the reporting of farm-level emissions will become mandatory by 2024. A final decision on the implementation of farmlevel pricing on emissions will depend on the outcome of a government study into its feasibility. This transition period allows farmers and government agencies to build capacity on the MRV of farm-level emissions prior to the introduction of carbon pricing";"Henderson, Ben

"UNCCD:1586";"Role of innovation in meeting food security challenges";"";"Global food production must ramp up in the face of enormous challenges. We are all familiar with many of the key metrics surrounding the central food security challenge: By the year 2050, the earth’s population is expected to soar from the current 7bn about 9.6bn. It is estimated that in the next 40 to 50 years, we will need to produce as much food as was necessary in the previous 10,000.

This requires a dramatic increase in agricultural production, which must be achieved against a backdrop of issues such as climate change (and the attendant ills of extreme weather, flooding and droughts), water and soil depletion and
degradation, and possible yield plateaus in key production regions for wheat and rice. The need to intensify production on existing lands rather than relying too heavily on new ones—which would require deforestation or the clearing of
savannahs—will also require new technologies all along the agricultural chain, to boost production and replenish overworked farmland.

An estimated 2.5bn people live in about 500m small farm households—and increasing their levels of production is crucial. This requires greater access to high-quality agricultural inputs as well as to finance and credit. Private firms and NGOs are responding with creative financing tools, a range of new technologies to help them farm more abundantly, sustainably and efficiently, and better seeds, fertilisers and soil management tools.

"UNCCD:1588";"Landscape Sourcing: Sustainable business using the landscape approach";"";"The WWF’s Landscape Sourcing Report: Sustainable Business Using the Landscape Approach makes a case for the private sector to adopt landscape approaches to sustainably strengthen and increase cost effectiveness within their supply chains.
Due to climate change and other environmental crises,  the private sector is facing a number of issues that threaten the reliability and health of their supply chains. These risks include resource depletion, increased unreliability of water flows needed for farming and other industries,  and social issues such as labour rights and the health and integrity of indigenous communities.

Many company leaders now acknowledge that sustainability is not only good for the planet, but also good for their bottom line. Adopting a landscape approach as many companies have chosen to do  is an attractive entry point into the circular economy and can both help address environmental concerns while still maintaining company profitability. 

The landscape approach is a conceptual framework whereby stakeholders in a landscape aim to reconcile competing social, economic and environmental objectives. In practice, the landscape approach helps provide tools to manage land sustainably in areas where human activity competes with environmental and biodiversity goals. Adopting a landscape approach results in a sustainable landscape, satisfying the needs of the many actors dependent on and with vested interest in that landscape- communities, local organizations, private sector, and the government.  Landscape sourcing is a methodology for product sourcing that contributes positively to the goals of a sustainable landscape through product certification which  identifies commodities  that are produced and grown using sustainable landscape management. 

Benefits of adopting a landscape approach

When companies commit to a landscape approach, they invest in people and land, communities and biodiversity. This commitment also means working to achieve a shared understanding of the conditions, challenges and opportunities in a given landscape with multiple stakeholders agreeing to a common vision and goals. 

There are many tangible benefits for a company to invest in and build a landscape approach, including:

    Reducing operating costs 
    Giving themselves a competitive advantage in fast-developing markets
    Building a wider client base
    Securing the long-term viability of the business
    Strengthening reputation
    Attracting the best talent
    Supporting business innovation";"Dudley, N.

"UNCCD:1590";"Forests, Trees and the Eradication of Poverty: Potential and Limitations";"";"The report, “Forests, Trees and the Eradication of Poverty: Potential and Limitations,” shows that forests and trees support human well-being and are critical to end poverty. It finds that forest-poverty dynamics are affected by a range of social, economic, political, and environmental context factors, such as rural outmigration, gender norms, remittance flows, and elite capture. The report’s key messages are highlighted below.

    Forests and trees can help the poor face global changes such as climate change.
    Benefits from forests and trees to human well-being are unevenly distributed.
    Structural barriers prevent poor people from using forest and tree products to exit poverty.
    Inadequate land use policies may lead the poor to bear excessive costs.
    Policy and management measures that enable forests and trees to contribute to poverty alleviation must be tailored to each specific context.
A Brief History of the Global Forest Expert Panels

The GFEP initiative was established in April 2007, as a joint initiative of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF). Since then, the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) has led and coordinated it. The GFEP initiative’s core activity is to prepare global reports and accompanying policy briefs that reflect state-of-the-art understanding of forest-related issues.

The publications are prepared by thematic Expert Panels consisting of internationally recognized scientific experts in their fields selected by the IUFRO coordination team. The reports are peer reviewed and written in an accessible manner to reach policymakers, stakeholders, and the broader public. Each report is accompanied by a shorter policy brief summarizing key messages. The frequency of reports varies according to information needs and requests from intergovernmental processes.

The UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework aims at restoring the productivity of degraded lands, improving the livelihoods of people, and reducing the impacts of drought on vulnerable populations (UNCCD, 2017). National Action Programmes are the key instruments for realising these goals, and parties to the Convention are requested to include measures in them to conserve natural resources, such as the sustainable management of forests (Wildburger, 2009). The

UNCCD emphasises ‘land degradation neutrality’ as a pathway to sustainable development, within which forests (particularly forest restoration and rehabilitation) play a substantial role.
All of these international commitments are interrelated and form an important basis for the SDGs and their implementation. The SDGs themselves are rooted in the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were adopted in the Millennium Declaration in 2000 as the international framework for development policy until 2015. Under this earlier agenda, countries committedto reduce extreme poverty and made major progress toward that goal.

So far, the GFEP has completed six global reports.

    The 2009 report on “Adaptation of Forests and People to Climate Change” highlights that: climate change over the past half-century has already affected forest ecosystems; the impacts of climate change on forest goods and services will have far-reaching social and economic consequences for forest-dependent people, particularly the forest dependent poor; and to meet adaptation challenges, commitment to achieving sustainable forest management goals must be strengthened at both the international and national levels.
    The 2011 report on “Embracing Complexity: Meeting the Challenges of International Forest Governance” highlights that: international forest governance is complex and fragmented; and many critical forest problems are cross-sectoral and require synergistic approaches involving a wide range of policy instruments.
    The 2012 report on “Understanding Relationships Between Biodiversity, Carbon, Forests, and People: the Key to Achieving REDD+ Objectives” highlights: biodiversity as a key determinant of forests’ ability to effectively provide ecosystem services, notably carbon sequestration, and to remain resilient in the face of disturbances such as climate change; for effective REDD+ implementation, tenure and property rights, including rights of access, use, and ownership, must be clear; and a tension between national REDD+ efforts aimed at international standardization, the strengthening of national sovereignty, and efforts to empower local communities as key actors in REDD+.
    The 2015 report on “Forests, Trees, and Landscapes for Food Security and Nutrition” underscores that: forests and tree-based systems have played a major role throughout human history in supporting livelihoods as well as meeting the global population’s food security and nutritional needs; governance shifts to multi-sectoral and cross-scale governance present better prospects for integrating different interests and goals related to forest and food systems; and securing tenure and local control is essential for forests and food security.
    The 2016 report on “Illegal Logging and Related Timber Trade” highlights that: despite increasing international governance efforts, illegal forest activities remain pervasive; and cross-sectoral and integrated policies are needed to ensure effective governance responses since illegal forest activities are not merely the forest sector’s problem.
    The 2018 report on “Forest and Water on a Changing Planet” explains: the link between water and forests exists within a broader climate-forest-water-people system; forests, especially natural forests, contribute to the resilience of the water supply for humans; and any new institutional arrangement should be sensitive to distributional concerns, as well as to social and environmental justice and equity, particularly the rights of marginalized and vulnerable communities.

In 2019, IUFRO initiated a new GFEP to carry out a comprehensive global assessment of available scientific information about the interactions between forests and poverty. Building on this, it sought to prepare a report to contribute to implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by highlighting the nexus between Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as relevant links to other SDGs. The GFEP on Forests and Poverty was tasked with addressing, inter alia:

    the different dimensions of the relationship between forests, trees, and poverty, as well as the roles of forests and trees in poverty reduction;
    trade-offs between development for poverty reduction, and forest restoration, sustainable forest management, and forest conservation; and
    underlying conditions constraining the achievement of goals related to poverty alleviation and sustainable forest management, such as power asymmetries, corruption, lack of political will, and marginalization.

A core group of 21 experts, supported by 22 additional experts, from different parts of the world and different scientific backgrounds worked together on this study for almost two years. Following a scoping meeting in Rome, Italy, in May 2019, the experts met three times. The first meeting took place in August 2019 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, US, and the second in January 2020 in Nairobi, Kenya. The third meeting in April 2020 was originally supposed to take place in Vienna, Austria, but was moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first-ever virtual Panel meeting in the context of the GFEP initiative. The October 2020 official launch of the report, which this brief summarizes, was also conducted online. The launch of the report was timed in conjuncture with the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October 2020.";"Miller, Daniel C.

"UNCCD:1665";"Mapping Together: A Guide to Monitoring Forest and Landscape Restoration Using Collect Earth Mapathons";"";"Mapping Together helps people use Collect Earth mapathons to monitor tree-based restoration. Collect Earth enables users to create precise data that can show where trees are growing outside the forest across farms, pasture, and urban areas and how the landscape has changed over time.

Building on WRI and FAO’s Road to Restoration, a guide that helps people make tough choices and set realistic goals for restoring landscapes, Mapping Together takes this process one step further. It helps them to track progress on their biophysical restoration goals using Collect Earth, an open-source data collection tool that pairs freely available, very high-resolution satellite imagery with local knowledge of the landscape.

Collect Earth mapathons can help stakeholders answer key monitoring questions by providing the framework for tracking changes in land use/land cover, tree cover and count, tree spatial pattern, and related indicators. Mapathons involve local stakeholders and people familiar with the landscape as data collectors and interpreters, increasing the data’s accuracy. The resulting data and products are then owned by local experts.

Four case studies – from El Salvador, Ethiopia, India, and Rwanda – presented in Mapping Together show how various stakeholders have used and adapted Collect Earth mapathons to answer their own questions about restoration progress.
Four case studies presented in Mapping Together show how governments have used and adapted Collect Earth to suit their individual context.

    Cerron Grande watershed, El Salvador: The government of El Salvador used a Collect Earth mapathon to collect data on recent changes in land use and tree cover. Their goal was to identify restoration opportunities within this critically important watershed that supplies water to the capital city, San Salvador. The data collected show average percent tree cover across forest, cropland and grassland areas to determine whether there was opportunity to increase tree cover on various land uses. The majority of croplands had 0% tree cover, while grasslands had 10% tree cover, and forests had 90% tree cover.

    Sodo Guragie Woreda, Ethiopia The Ethiopian Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission (EFCCC) used Collect Earth to track where trees are growing within a local distict. The objective of their survey was to report on local progress toward the national Climate Resilient Green Economy strategy and the woreda’s target of reaching 19% forest cover. Data was collected for 2010 and 2015 to show progress toward the target of 19% forest cover. Results showed that forest cover increased from 7.5% in 2010 to 8.1% in 2015, a positive trend but still short of the target.

    Sidhi District, India: The Collect Earth mapathon for Sidhi assessed where land could benefit from restoration. The objective was three-fold: show where tree cover already exists outside of the forest; show where restoration was already occurring on and around farms; and identify where more trees could be grown. To highlight the opportunity to increase on-farm tree cover in Sidhi district, data showed where existing tree cover was less than 40% and could be increased through growing trees on farms and other techniques.

    Gatsibo District, Rwanda: National and district experts conducted a Collect Earth mapathon to show how many trees are growing in this rural district and to assess progress toward meeting the district’s target of 30% forest cover. Results showed that percent tree cover across the sectors of Gatsibo ranged from 12 to 22%, showing that all sectors needed to increase tree cover to meet the 30% target. The majority of land cover change that occurred between 2006 and 2014 involved net loss of forest, wetland, grasslands, and shrublands and net gain of cropland and settlements.

"UNCCD:1670";"Scramble for Land Rights: Reducing Inequity between Communities and Companies";"";"  Community land, crucial to rural livelihood around the world, is increasingly targeted by commercial interests. Its loss can lead to environmental degradation, increased rural poverty and land disputes that last for years. Without formal legal recognition of their land rights, communities struggle to protect their land from being allocated to outside investors.
    This report reveals endemic challenges facing communities across 15 countries. Procedures to register and document their customary land rights are complex, difficult and costly, requiring communities to sacrifice time, finances and customary land and resources.
    As a result, it can take decades for communities to formalize their land rights. In the Philippines, the process requires 56 legally mandated steps; in Indonesia, 21 different government entities were involved.
    In comparison, companies acquire formal land rights relatively quickly. Some companies take shortcuts to acquire land or begin commercial operations before obtaining final approvals. Few laws require foreign investors to engage in meaningful community consultation. This disadvantages more responsible companies and risks displacing communities.
    To level the playing field between communities and companies, this report calls on countries to establish accessible and transparent community procedures that recognize all customary land, mitigate associated land conflicts, coordinate implementation and budgetary support for community land formalization, and better monitor company compliance.
Indigenous and community lands, crucial for rural livelihoods, are typically held under informal customary arrangements. This can leave the land vulnerable to outside commercial interests, so communities may seek to formalize their land rights in a government registry and obtain an official land document. But this process is time-consuming and complex, and in contrast, companies can acquire land relatively quickly and find shortcuts around regulatory burdens. This report maps these inequities between communities and companies, and offers recommendations on how to level the playing field.

Land Rights in Context

As global demand for foods, fuels, minerals, fibers, wood products, and other natural resources grows, both large and small-scale land acquisitions are on the rise around the world. Companies and investors are scrambling to acquire land and secure it for long periods of time. As this competition intensifies, land that communities (including Indigenous Peoples) hold under customary tenure is vulnerable to acquisition by powerful political and economic elites, particularly if it is not entered in a government registry (cadastre) or officially documented (land certificate or title). Against this backdrop, communities across Africa, Latin America, and Asia are mobilizing to formalize their customary rights and better protect their land. The stakes are high, given that as many as 2.5 billion people depend heavily on community land for subsistence. And while the drivers of socioeconomic inequality (and the resulting unequal opportunities and treatments) vary by country and over time, land inequality largely drives income inequality in Latin America and is a growing factor in some Asian and African countries.

Governments often consider community land, especially the land managed as common property (e.g., forests, pastures, and wetlands), to be vacant, idle, and underused. For many, the promise of economic growth and needed foreign exchange trumps community land rights and justifies allocating this land to companies for investment purposes. In addition to this bias, there are often inequities between legal procedures that govern acquisition of formal land rights by communities and by companies, as well as in how these procedures are implemented.

"UNCCD:281";"Terra Incognita:Land degradation as underestimated threat amplifier. Clingendael Report";"";"Land degradation is increasingly recognised as global challenge and is even pushed for as candidate for a (post-2015) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The ‘quality of soil’ has been linked to the emergence of conflict, inter alia since it aggravates food and water scarcity. It is an underestimated, but essential element in the nexus of global challenges related to food, water and energy. This Clingendael Report, finds, amongst others, that accurate assessments on land degradation and efforts to restore lands are still lacking to date. 

On the basis of a literature review and 4 small case studies, the study concludes that it is nevertheless likely that land degradation can operate as threat amplifier, particularly when it is combined with rapid population growth, poverty, little opportunity to migrate and bad governance. From this perspective, efforts to get a more accurate insight into the scope of the land degradation problem and its implications for human security are long overdue.

Even though women make up a large share of Africa’s farmers, they are, for the most part, locked out of land ownership, access to credit and productive farm inputs, support from extension services and access to markets, to name just a few factors essential to their productivity. This array of daunting challenges means that, on average, Africa’s female farmers produce less per hectare compared with men, which adversely affects their families, communities and – in the long term – entire countries.
Despite the centrality of agriculture in the economies of most African nations, relatively little is known about why farms managed by women are on average less productive.

As a further disconnect, the Bank chooses to overlook the negative record of FDIs in receiving countries.

It is based on a quantitative survey of 95 smallholders and over 300 plots (49 of which are cultivated by women), as well as qualitative analysis using transcriptions of interviews with groups of dignitaries, men and women. The main means of access to land identified are via inheritance and gifts, which together accounted for access to 80% to 90% of the plots surveyed. The remaining 10% to 20% of cultivated plots were obtained through family ties/social relations or loans, which are becoming subject to more rigid conditions. Men generally inherit or are given their land, while women do not have the right to inherit land and mainly gain access through gifts or social relationships. Through these relationships women are sometimes able to farm relatively large areas. Our sources reported that lenders do not set strict limits regarding access to, management, use of, or investment in the land borrowed. This is partly confirmed by levels of investment: in two of the three villages studied, no significant difference was observed in the level of improvements made to land obtained via inheritance, gifts, social relationships or loans.";"Stamm, Volker

Both reports share a common objective of addressing what might be considered two unfinished agenda items on Africa’s development trajectory. Both have long been recognized as important priorities for the governments and citizens of African countries.This year’s report on gender equality reviews the ongoing efforts of African countries to accelerate the pace of assuring women’s empowerment through all spheres of society – in the home and community, in health and educational attainment, in the workplace, and in political participation and leadership. 
While significant progress has been made across numerous fronts in most countries, gender equality for African women and girls is still far from satisfactory. To address the gender gap, this report adopts a political economy approach to gender equality and women’s empowerment in Africa.
A key message of this report is that giving more concerted attention to gender equality will be an important and long overdue stimulus to faster and more inclusive human development and economic growth for the

"UNCCD:1301";"Governing Tenure Rights to Commons: A guide to support the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security";"";"The Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (FAO, 2012 – referred to in this guide as ‘the Guidelines’) were unanimously adopted by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) in 2012, with subsequent broad international recognition and support. Their strength rests on the unique inclusive and participatory process through which they were developed. They are an instrument of soft law, but they are also strongly rooted in existing international human rights law, laying out the obligations and responsibilities of state and non-state actors to govern tenure of land, fisheries and forests responsibly, including commons. They provide internationally agreed guidance on how to recognize, protect and support legitimate tenure rights, including individual and collective tenure rights, and those employed under customary systems.

Secure tenure rights to commons are crucial for women and men, indigenous peoples and local communities in various contexts, including fisherfolk, pastoralists, farmers, landless people, and other vulnerable, food insecure and marginalized groups. They depend on commons for their fundamental well-being: for access to food, for sustaining their livelihoods, and for their cultural and social identity. The Guidelines represent a historic opportunity to guide governments and hold them accountable in assuming their duties and fulfilling their obligations to implement secure tenure for the legitimate holders of rights to commons.

By following the guidance and principles of the Guidelines, governments will contribute to translating internationally agreed goals on sustainable development into national and local realities: to respond to the livelihood needs of their people; to achieve food security and eradicate poverty; to realize the right to food, self-identification and self-determination; to support the sustainable use of natural resources and equitable access to and control of the resources; to achieve sustainable social and economic development. The Guidelines acknowledge the crucial role played by participation, and call on governments to support the activities of civil society to increase the uptake of the Guidelines’ principles.

This technical guide on Governing Tenure Rights to Commons provides strategic guidance and suggested practices for proactively implementing the standards and recommendations of the Guidelines, with the aim of recognizing and protecting tenure rights to commons and community-based governance structures. The guide was prepared by the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) whose research on sustainability and land governance is based on a transdisciplinary approach. This aims to achieve the cogeneration of knowledge by actors from civil society, government and science, in order to create viable strategies for responsible and sustainable land governance. In accordance with this approach and objective, the guide was developed through a comprehensive multi-stakeholder process: the deliberation of relevant strategy recommendations took place via an international Sounding Board of commons experts, and a series of deliberation and consultation workshops with actors from various constituencies around the world.";"Vhugen, Darryl";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2016-12-31";"en";"agriculture;indigenous peoples;land access;land governance;land rights;land tenure;land use;women";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1301";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1301_FAO_Tenure_Commons.pdf";"";"";"";"84";"";""
"UNCCD:1310";"Making rangelands secure: Past experience and future options";"";"Significant progress has been made over the past decade or so in the development of policy and legislation that support the recognition of customary rights to land, with important legal rulings in Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique, South Sudan, and South Africa. At the same time, the strengthening of communities’ traditional rights to use resources has progressed through community forest reserves and community conservation areas.

However, many commons remain highly vulnerable, with land being removed by governments for national parks and large tracts appropriated for commercial agricultural investment on a regular basis (Alden Wily 2011). In particular this is true of the rangelands, where external interest in land for agriculture, and in its resources for other commercial ventures such as tourism, has grown. Even the most progressive policies and legislation still fail to provide adequate protection to many rangeland users and, most commonly, to the poorest and least powerful. At the same time, customary institutions that would have provided adequate protection in the past have been weakened due to both internal and external influences.

This is the situation faced by many members of the International Land Coalition (ILC) working with rural communities who are highly vulnerable to land and resource appropriation and loss. In an attempt to address this, in October 2010 ILC brought a group of its members together in Addis Ababa to develop a learning initiative that will explore this topic through 2011–2012.1 The aim of this initiative is to identify ways in which the security of customary land users over their common property resources (including land) can be strengthened. In particular, it will focus on multi-use landscapes or territories such as rangelands, where the vulnerability of land and resource users is particularly high.

As a first step in the development of the learning initiative, this scoping paper explores past and present experiences of land and resource tenure in rangelands (predominantly in Africa, where the bulk of the rangelands are located). It discusses the limitations of many of the tools and systems used to date, and identifies alternatives that have potential for providing greater security of tenure to rangeland users in the future. The further exploration of these alternatives will be the task of those taking part in the learning initiative over the next year.";"Flintan, Fiona";"";"International Land Coalition";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2012-12-31";"en";"land access;land rights;land tenure;land use;rangelands;tenure security";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"002";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1310";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1310_ILC_Making_Rangelands_Secure.pdf";"";"";"";"87";"";""
"UNCCD:1353";"Gender, land and agricultural development in Africa. From women to gender";"";"While academics have largely shifted their focus from ‘women in development’ to addressing women and men as
part of broader ‘gendered’ social relations, this shift is yet to be fully translated into development practice. This
requires development practitioners to be sensitive to local contexts and to the various inequalities they contain
with regards to land rights and land use (based on class, gender, age, migration status etc.).
•• Empowering women means more than just providing them with a property title. They need to be educated on their rights and find their voice in local and national decision-making processes in order to be able to challenge existing gender stereotypes and claim their rights to access land.
•• Empowering women also requires the inclusion of, and support of, men, for example through raising awareness about gender and land among men to build social legitimacy for gender-equitable institutions and decisionmaking processes on land.
•• Agricultural investments specifically need to be grounded in broad-based consultations through their initial design, structuring and negotiating stages. They then need to be carefully monitored by governments and development agencies throughout project implementation to ensure that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities around gender and land, but recognise, respect and compensate for the alienation of different land users’ rights.

"UNCCD:1390";"Youth access to land, migration and employment opportunities: evidence from sub-Saharan Africa";"";"This paper examines the intersections between youth access to land, migration decisions and employment opportunities using nationally representative and multi-year data from multiple African countries. We document evidence on the evolving dynamics in land distribution and ownership patterns, the effect of land access on youth livelihood choices and development of rental and sales market in the region. 

The report highlights six key findings:  
#First, a progressively smaller proportion of young people are inheriting land due to land scarcity.  
#Second, rural youth who do inherit land will need to wait longer to gain access to it because of significantly longer adult life spans. 
#Third, land scarcity has been driving rapid changes in the land ownership and distribution patterns over the past decade and shaping the employment and migration decisions of rural youth.  
#Fourth, the share of individual labour time devoted to farming is declining over time across age categories and gender, signifying that continued economic transformation processes are underway in Africa.   Nonetheless, farming still accounts for significant shares of individuals’ labour time, particularly between the ages of 15 to 19 years.  As young people progress into their 20s and 30s, the share of their work time in farming significantly declines in favour of off-farm employment opportunities.  
#Fifth, access to land is an important determinant of the share of the labour time that young people devote to farming activities and their decision whether to migrate out of their home area. Other factors such as education, age of the household head and number of male or female siblings also significantly influenced youth livelihood choices.  
#Sixth, we find a strong inverse relationship between participation in land rental markets and the age of household head:  younger heads are generally more likely to rent in land than older heads, particularly in countries with relatively active rental markets.  

Overall, the analysis suggests that policy actions promoting access to land and security of tenure will significantly shape young people’s engagement in farming and livelihood options. To be successful, such policies will need to recognize and anticipate the impacts of the evolving dynamics in land distribution and ownership trends and develop effective responses that will foster inclusive, competitive and productive agricultural growth.  Policies to promote youth access to land and security of tenure are not necessarily intended to keep youth permanently engaged in farming but rather to stimulate dynamic agricultural productivity growth in ways that drive continued economic transformation and diversification.";"Yeboah, Kwame F.

"UNCCD:1391";"The narrative on rural youth and economic opportunities in Africa: facts, myths and gaps";"";" A narrative on rural youth in Africa has continued to evolve in policy circles around the world. Much of it is driven by population statistics that point to an imminent youth bulge in Africa and concerns about a poor economic outlook (stagnation) for African productivity and growth. Fears of massive unemployment, social unrest and undesirable migration due to limited economic growth drive the bulk of the discourse. This is juxtaposed with the promise of a youth dividend for the continent, which is highlighted by some quarters of the policy debate. 

This paper reviews the narrative on rural youth and economic opportunities in Africa, using a set of policy documents from various African countries and regional and international organizations. It then looks at the evidence to question the validity of the narrative. Where evidence does not exist, the paper uses available data from a variety of sources to begin painting a descriptive picture on rural youth in Africa. Some misconceptions in the narrative are identified. These include the notions that rural youth are not engaging in agriculture, that they are better educated (skilled) and that they are more likely to use and benefit from internet and communications technologies (ICT). In addition, the notion that youth entrepreneurship offers great promise for rural youth in Africa is brought into question.

What this paper shows is that rural youth in Africa are in fact engaging in agriculture and the agrifood system in general. Moreover, while rural transformation is indeed taking place, with some rural youth moving into other sectors of the economy, large numbers of African rural youth are still predicted to enter the agrifood system in the coming decades. This calls for more investment in African agriculture to enhance the prospects of rural youth in Africa. While the evidence does show that African youth are indeed more educated than their parents and previous generations, several constraints on the level and quality of learning in rural Africa are raised. In particular, young African women in rural areas face a multitude of barriers to human capital formation, including early pregnancy and parenthood as well as early marriage. These constrain their prospects for continued learning and skills development and in turn limit their economic outlook. New evidence on non-cognitive skills development and learning outside conventional school settings provides important insights on some of the promising interventions that could enhance human capital formation among rural youth, especially for young women in Africa. 

The paper also identifies major constraints on IT access, especially the prohibitive cost of mobile phone services. Low access to capital and skills continue to constrain rural youth entrepreneurship and are likely to persist if relevant investments are not made and policy action is not taken. Drawing on the broad literature review and data analysis, the paper concludes with recommendations on policy and investments for rural youth in Africa. The paper also highlights the need for rigorous research on identified knowledge gaps";"Mabiso, Athur

"UNCCD:1392";"Investing in rural youth in the Near East, North Africa, Europe and Central Asia";"";"Countries of the Near East, North Africa, Europe and Central Asia (NEN) region face a myriad of social, economic and political challenges that have stalled their structural and rural transformation processes. This has had a detrimental impacton rural youth, who, as a result, face limited economic opportunities. The NEN region has the highest youth unemployment rates in the world. Weak education systems are failing to provide youth, especially in rural areas, with the cognitive and non-cognitive skills they need to compete in a global economy. 

The NEN region also suffers from low levels of female labour force participation. Excessive regulation has dampened the agricultural business climate. This is especially problematic given that the region is among the most water-scarce in the world, a condition further aggravated by global warming. The resulting high rates of joblessness, unemployment and informal work have encouraged rural youth to migrate to urban areas and abroad in search of better opportunities.  This background paper reviews the opportunities and challenges facing rural youth in the NEN region and suggests a number of programme and policy priorities that NEN governments should consider. 

These include (1) improving the rural business environment and moving away from resource-depleting rentier systems that institutionalize cronyism and dependency; (2) reforming education systems to provide rural youth with the market-relevant skills they need to succeed; (3) addressing gender imbalances and developing policies to ensure that young women are able to find acceptable work; (4) improving the evidence base on effective rural youth policies and programmes; and (5) improving access to microfinance and business services for rural youth who are trying to start, manage or grow a business.";"Kabbani, Nader";"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2019-12-31";"en";"agriculture;food security;land access;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;rural population;women;youth";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security;Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"002;015;143;145;150";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1392";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1392_20_Kabbani_2019 RDR BACKGROUND PAPER(1).pdf";"";"";"";"47";"";""
"UNCCD:1393";"The rural youth situation in Latin America and the Caribbean";"";" This article offers a general picture of the situation of rural youth in Latin America and the Caribbean(LAC). The population is described through its demographic dynamics, its socio-economiccharacteristics, the situation of priority groups (women and indigenous peoples) and subjects ofinterest for these particular population groups (use of IT, sexual and reproductive health, violence andsocial participation). 

The available data regarding these dimensions are presented noting the existinggaps, both about urban youth and about adults, and contrasting the data with the available literatureon youth in the region.From the results, it is worth noting that the region’s youth represents a heterogeneous group, althoughone with common characteristics that sets it apart as a group of interest. Particularly, it can be seenthat there are still gaps between rural and urban youth in the areas of poverty, education andworkforce integration in every country, although with important differences between them. 
Thus,ruralyouth appear to be an especially vulnerable group, a situation that is aggravated in women,indigenous people and Afro-descendants. The lack of opportunities in rural areas causes this group to migrate to cities in larger proportions than adults, which has important consequences for their places oforigin.As recommendations, we propose the introduction of the gap closure approach into the analysis, withparticular emphasis on the new roles and the economic, social and political weight of younger ruralwomen, recognizing the importance and implications of the ever-growing indigenous composition ofthe populations in LAC. 

Likewise, it is vital to advance the production of data that are disaggregated ona subregional scale and by age groups, which allowus to generate specific information and to developpublic programmes and policies that are relevant, with a territorial and rights approach, and thatcontribute to closing gaps and ensuring equality and opportunity for all of the region’s youth";"Guiskin, Maia

"UNCCD:1394";"Investing in rural youth in the Asia and the Pacific region";"";"Thispaper characterizes the structural and rural transformation of the Asia and the Pacific region(APR), highlighting the implications for rural youth opportunities and challenges, and identifying andelaborating on the characteristics, opportunities and challenges related to rural youth inclusion. Nearly half of the population in Asia is urban, with the proportion projected to rise to 59 per cent by 2035. 

Except for China, the majority of youth still reside in rural areas. Youth labour force participation ishigher in rural than urban areas, and for males than females. Rural youth in countries with lowstructural transformation and low rural transformation continue to rely on agriculture for employment; incountries with high levels of transformation, a majority of rural youth are now employed outsideagriculture (though it is still the biggest contributor to rural youth employment). 

About one fifth of youthin Asia are not in education, employment or training. More than 86 per cent of employed youth in Asiaand the Pacific are in the informal sector, greater than the proportion of informal employment among adult workers.The full potential for structural transformation in APR may fail to be realized because of barriers facing rural youth in terms of migration,achieving full human development, gaining access to land, farmtechnology, financial services, and other enterprise support. 

Promising areas for investing in the futureof rural youth are the following.
Access to land: there is some quantitative evidence showing the benefits of freehold titling programmes, which suggests opportunities for improving tenure for rural youth and especially women already cultivating land.

Education and human development: investments in school facilities in villages have beenfound toimprove enrolment and learning outcomes. The farmer field school approach is also effective.Information and communication technology (ICT) can promote agricultural extension, which appears toaugur well for youth, who appear to be pioneer adopters of ICT in rural villages. 

Expansion of vocational education is beneficial especially where its incidence is low. In Asia, linkage with futureemployment is the single most important factor in training success. Sexual and reproductive healtheducation, counselling and contraceptive availability are effective in increasing adolescent knowledgerelated to sexual health, contraceptive use and decreasing adolescent pregnancy.

Access to finance and enterprise support:social funds/microcredit operations are effective financialinstruments that can be easily inserted in community demand-driven interventions for rapid jobcreation with extended outreach.

"UNCCD:400000338";"Questions de genre en zones sèches: Les femmes, actrices de la lutte contre la désertification";"";"The economic and social organization of rural societies has a high level of gender differentiation in terms of rights, activities
and responsibilities. This interacts with other aspects of social stratification based on factors such as ethnicity, statutory groups, religion and level of wealth. Consequently, women do not represent a homogeneous category, but a group whose interests are sometimes conflicting and which are equally subject to power relations. Some observations:

• The sexual division of labour is universal, but varies from one society to another as well as over time. Women are often assigned to jobs (such as unpaid domestic work) that are accorded less value both socially and economically.
• The organization of work is only marginally based on the strictly physical capacities of men and women. More so it arises from complex interactions between diverse family models, technoeconomic transformation, and power relations within a society. For example, a so-called ‘women’s’ activity may begin to interest men as a result of technological change or an increase in market value.
• Quantifying the activities of women in rural areas is difficult due to their relative invisibility in statistics and surveys. These are often restricted to collecting data on the head of the household or farm and include few of the economic activities – market or non-market – that women are involved in. Women often work more hours than men, and they have a larger share of non-commercial activities.
• In relation to men, women have fewer access rights to resources, both tangible (e.g. property, money) and intangible (e.g.
consideration, representation in decision-making bodies, educational level).
• Gender also influences access to natural resources – land, water, trees, etc. The disparity between men and women can be partly explained by unequal modes of transmission of the rights to these resources.";"Droy, Isabelle

Can land be dealt with like other resources or – in terms of an economic perspective– forms of capital. Or does it attract particular meanings, sentiments, interests, acquisition strategies or social relations? 
What is particular to the production and dissemination of knowledge and capacity building about “land”? Is the influence of donor agencies, cooperation partners, NGOs and of science on decision-making meanwhile stronger on land than in other policy fields of development cooperation as it is embedded in numerous value judgments on justice, fairness, equity and inclusion of the poor and other disadvantaged groups like indigenous people and women?Through the looking-glass of the dominant economic system, which has emerged over the last centuries, land acquisition and use of land are largely about economic values, land valuation and demarcation of diverse production areas – for food, energy, shelter, mineral commodities, border and buffer areas, etc. 

As the global competition on land is undoubtedly growing and the key question of how land might be managed best – with a side-view on land as a common, non-replaceable, nonproducible, indispensable good – the attention being given to knowledge transfer, “information brokerage” and capacity development on local to global land issues,and capacity development on local to global land issues, is increasing. 
Concerns about the economic, social and environmental impacts of land grabbing, in particular for the poor, are at the forefront of these efforts. Hence, certain uses and “products” of land are being increasingly recognized as a public good, as its properties generate benefits in favor of a vast majority of people beyond mere private profits.

Thus, ‘good governance’, participation, rule of law, certainty of the law, and access to productive resources, are (once again) of key importance for policy formulation and development cooperation.

"UNCCD:1611";"Uneven Ground: Land Inequality at the Heart of Unequal Societies";"";"On 24 November 2020 the Land Inequality Initiative (International Land Coalition, OXFAM, Welthungerhilfe)  launched its new research report ""Uneven Ground: Land Inequality at the Heart of Unequal Societies"", and a series of groundbreaking studies that reveal new insights and data proving that land inequality is rising.

In the new study released today, researchers say that land inequality is rising in Africa and globally. Worse, the unfettered realisation of land inequality trends would create a social and economic disaster of massive proportions on the continent.

The report, Uneven Ground: land inequality at the heart of unequal societies, is the first of its kind, shedding new light on the scale and speed of this growing phenomenon and providing the most comprehensive picture available today. The report was informed by 17 specially commissioned research papers as well as analysis of existing data and literature under a wide partnership led by the International Land Coalition, and in close collaboration with Oxfam.

Unemployment and reduced incomes are among the leading consequences of land inequality, with critical implications for Africa, with a large youth population. Large industrialised farms absorb fewer workers overall and tend to casualise the workforce, pushing real wages down. On the continent, where agriculture is still the largest employer and youth unemployment is a major challenge, the unfettered continuation of current land inequality trends would create a social and economic disaster of massive proportions.

New measurements, used by the report, show that the top 10 percent of the rural population captures 60 percent of agricultural land value, while the bottom 50 percent of the rural populations only control 3 percent of land value.

“In the framework of this project, a new way to measure land inequality was developed that goes beyond land size distribution captured through traditional agricultural census.” said Ward Anseeuw, co-author of the report and coordinator of the initiative.

The study finds that land inequality directly threatens the livelihoods of an estimated 2.5 billion people involved in smallholder agriculture, of which 33 million in Africa contributing up to 90% of food production, as well the world’s poorest 1.4 billion people, most of whom depend largely on agriculture for their livelihoods.

“Sub-Saharan Africa faces a dramatic job challenge to generate employment for its young, rapidly growing population. To provide jobs for the 28 million young Africans entering the job market in 2030, there is need to push for responsible and equitable investment on land,” says Audace Kubwimana, ILC Africa regional coordinator.

The report reveals that land inequality is fundamentally related to political inequality, particularly in societies where accumulation of land conveys political power. In Senegal, GOANA’s elite capture of policy and policy processes ensured that by 2010, over 657,000 hectares or around 17 percent of Senegal’s arable land was allocated to 17 private firms. Ten of the firms were Senegalese and the rest were foreign.

The authors also show that land inequality is central to other forms of inequality, and many of the continent’s crises. Increasing land inequality will have significant negative consequences for all Africa, on economic and social development, on the environment and on democracy and peace.

“As we move towards a post-Covid world, we will see increased pressure for fast economic gain at the expense of people and nature,” Mike Taylor, Director of the International Land Coalition Secretariat warned. Adding, “there is always, however, a more inclusive path to re-building our economies, that emphasises sustainable use of natural resources, respects human rights and addresses systemic causes of inequality.”

One per cent of the world’s farms operate 70% of crop fields, ranches and orchards, according to a report that highlights the impact of land inequality on the climate and nature crises.

Since the 1980s, researchers found control over the land has become far more concentrated both directly through ownership and indirectly through contract farming, which results in more destructive monocultures and fewer carefully tended smallholdings.

Taking the rising value of property and the growth of landless populations into account for the first time, the report calculates land inequality is 41% higher than previously believed.
The authors said the trend was driven by short-term financial instruments, which increasingly shape the global environment and human health.

“In the past, these instruments were only of concern to the markets. They didn’t affect us individually. But now they touch every aspect of our lives because they are linked to the environmental crisis and the pandemic,” said Ward Anseeuw, senior technical specialist at the International Land Coalition, which led the research along with a group of partners including Oxfam and the World Inequality Lab.

The study published on Tuesday, is based on 17 new research papers as well as analysis of existing data and literature.

It says previous calculations of land inequality were based exclusively on ownership and the size of individual farms. On this basis, land inequality narrowed until the 1980s, after which it became wider.";"";"International Land Coalition;Oxfam International;Welthungerhilfe";"International Land Coalition";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agriculture;land acquisitions;land law;land ownership;land policies";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1611";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1611_2020-synthesis-report-uneven-ground.pdf";"";"";"";"39";"";""

"UNCCD:262";"Land governance assessment framework: Identifying and monitoring good practice in the land sector";"";"Seventy-five percent of the world’s poor live in rural areas and most are involved in agriculture. In the 21st century, agriculture remains fundamental to economic growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability. Increased global demand for land because of higher and more volatile food prices, urbanization, and use of land for environmental services implies an increased need for well-designed land policies at the country level to ensure security of long-held rights, to facilitate land access, and to deal with externalities. Establishing the infrastructure necessary to proactively deal with these challenges can require large amounts of resources. Yet with land tenure deeply rooted in any country's history, a wide continuum of land rights, and vast differences in the level of socioeconomic development, the benefits to be expected and the challenges faced will vary across and even within countries, implying a need to adapt the nature and sequencing of reforms to country circumstances. Also, as reforms will take time to bear fruit and may be opposed by vested interests, there is a need to identify challenges and to reach consensus on how to address them in a way that allows objective monitoring of progress over time. Without this being done, the chances of making quick progress in addressing key land policy challenges are likely to be much reduced. The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is intended as a first step to help countries deal with these issues. It is a diagnostic tool that is to be implemented at the local level in a collaborative fashion, that addresses the need for guidance to diagnose and benchmark land governance, and that can help countries prioritize reforms and monitor progress over time.";"Deininger, Klaus

development. Carried out effectively, it can enable us to address critical challenges such as those of climate
change, urbanization, gender equality, and food security. But the technical complexity of land administration,
together with institutional and political hurdles, often made the governance of land weak and ineffective,

Since land governance provides a foundation for many issues critical to the post-2015 agenda, ways to draw out these links in the Sustainable Development Goals in a manner that facilitates monitoring and evidencebased decision-making is of utmost importance.Expansion of urban land has profound implications for the world’s biggest challenges. Cities consume around 70% of the world’s energy and account for nearly 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so they are at the core of any climate solution. One way to reduce carbon emissions is to ensure land is used efficiently, by developing cities which achieve the right kind of density with transport systems to improve connectivity.

"UNCCD:575";"Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement – A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development";"";"Fertile soils are an essential building block for human existence on Earth. The degradation of soils and land, in this regard, poses significant challenges for the well-being and food security of all the people around the world. Moreover, soils provide not only food, fiber, and many types of biomass we use, but also a wide
range of other essential ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water purification, cultural, and esthetic values. Unfortunately, in the Anthropocene, our age of mankind, the degradation of natural ecosystems, including land and soils, has rapidly increased, posing daunting challenges to achieving sustainable development and poverty reduction. Degradation of ecosystems is posing environmental challenges and is leading to the loss of land productivity—which in turn leads to conversion of high-value biomes—such as forests—to low-value biomes—especially in low-income countries, where majority of the rural poor heavily depend on natural resources. The resulting scarcities are often exacerbated by prohibiting and dispossessing people from access to land and fertile soils. Hence, sustainable soil management and responsible land governance have a great potential for being one of the corner stones of achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs).";"Nkonya, Ephraim

climate change, urbanization etc. On the remaining land, local, national and international users with different socioeconomic status and power compete to achieve food security, economic growth, energy supply, nature 
conservation and other objectives. Land use planning can help to find a balance among these competing and sometimes contradictory uses. At the core of land use planning is the joint balancing of competing land 
uses by all stakeholders (users and those being affected by the (changes in) land uses) and the joint determination of land uses for which the highest consensus can be achieved – ideally for the purpose of sustainability. In other words, land use planning activates the social processes of decision-making and consensus building concerning the utilization and protection of private, communal or public areas. At least in the context of development cooperation, land use planning is considered to be a participatory iterative process including continuous cycles of analysis, planning, decision-making, implementation and monitoring.";"";"German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development";"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2012-12-31";"en";"land governance;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;land use planning";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/654";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/654_land_use_planning_manual.pdf";"";"";"";"268";"";""
"UNCCD:713";"Urbanisation, land and property rights. The need to refocus attention";"";"The report’s findings suggest that policies and programmes of governments and the development partners could include a stronger focus on the development of peri-urban areas and smaller cities and towns. The rapid pace of change in peri-urban areas throws into relief any underlying issues in land tenure arrangements, land administration/planning and governance, such as overlapping mandates, conflicts in tenure systems, weak land administration/planning capacity and wider political economy issues that can block positive reforms.
Governments and funders could support activities to strengthen tenure arrangements, increasing capacity at municipal level to: recognise and manage different tenure systems and to manage the transition along the land rights continuum, protecting rights while allowing access to land to new entrants; and improve capacity at municipal level to undertake sound land use planning, including through more community-based practices, and better data use and management.

The literature reviewed for this study highlighted three main land issues as being particularly important for facilitating good outcomes from urbanisation:
• Sound land use planning, particularly when combined with gender-sensitive transportation planning to provide affordable access, appropriate densities, mix of land-uses, and safety for vulnerable populations and connect people to jobs, markets, essential services and political representation.
• Smoothly functioning land and housing markets and local authorities that are responsive to market failures, so that people and firms can easily relocate and can access suitable land and infrastructure for residential and economic purposes.
• Capable and responsive land market and urban management institutions that can ensure that formal sector housing and land markets can respond with adequate supply in the short-medium term and will plan on the basis of population projections to ensure the inclusion of the poorest urban dwellers.";"Locke, Anna

Despite rapid urbanization, the region remains predominantly rural. More than 60 per cent of its population live in rural areas, and the vast majority of these people are engaged in agriculture.

Due to rapid growth of its agricultural sector, the Mekong region has become a global centre of production and trade for commodities such as rubber, rice, cassava, wood, sugar cane, and palm oil. Between 1996 and 2015, overall agricultural land in the Mekong region grew by 20 per cent, or around 9 million hectares. 

Most of this expansion has occurred at the expense of the region’s natural capital – especially forests and other vegetation.The Mekong region at a tipping point?

While accelerated flows of global investment and the trade of land-intensive commodities have contributed to economic growth, the outcomes have been highly unequal: The benefits of development have largely accrued to the urban elite, while costs have largely been borne by the rural poor. Rural land relations are changing fundamentally, creating new insecurities for land tenure. The Mekong region may well be at a tipping point. Transformational change is crucial to sustainably address the needs of smallholders.

Data and information are a key prerequisite for understanding ongoing changes, informing more equitable and innovative decision-making, and monitoring the outcomes of decisions made. “State of Land in the Mekong Region” highlights key trends and changes in the Mekong region that dominate current land debates. In addition, it reflects on how these regional issues relate to global change processes. The report features contributions from world-leading experts from Asia, Europe, and the United States.

"UNCCD:1229";"Global  Sustainable  Development Report 2019: The Future is Now – Science for Achieving Sustainable Development";"";"A call to action: 20 interventions that will matter. The report’s Call to Action identifies 20 points where interventions can create transformative and accelerated progress towards multiple goals and targets in the coming decade. These targeted actions are based on the recent scientific literature analysing the deeper systemic interconnections that identify synergies and trade-offs between individual goals and targets. 

Decisions based on science. Science must play a major role in advancing sustainable development. Universities, policymakers and research funders must increase support to research guided by the 2030 Agenda. Simultaneously, researchers in sustainability science and other disciplines, must work together to solve development problems and strengthen the science-policy-society interface, providing society and policy-makers information they can use to solve development problems.  

Achieving land degradation neutrality can contribute to accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Restoring the soils of degraded ecosystems has the estimated potential to store up to 3 billion tons of carbon annually. Climate-smart land management practices, including low-emissions agriculture, agroforestry and restoration of high-carbon-value ecosystems, such as forests and peatlands, nearly always come with adaptation co-benefits.  

The report makes the case for shifting current research priorities and supporting innovative approaches to sustainability science, emphasizing cross-disciplinary partnerships, and committing support and resources to scientific institutions, particularly in the global South. Development aid budgets should prioritize boosting scientific capacity and access in the global South. UN Member States, research consortia and libraries should work together to improve cross-border and inter-disciplinary collaborations in science for the SDGs

The report also highlights the need for increased access to appropriate technologies and knowledge.  Developed countries need to change their production and consumption patterns, including by limiting the use of fossil fuels and plastics, and to encourage public and private investments that align with the SDGs.  The scientists suggest that the UN could promote a new sustainable development investment label, with clear parameters and guidelines, to encourage and reward investment in industries and financial markets that advance sustainable development and discourage investment in those that do not. 

The extensive transformation that is needed will not be easy, and the report suggests that a deep scientific understanding is needed to anticipate and mitigate the tensions and trade-offs inherent in widespread structural change. For example, those losing jobs in the shift away from fossil fuels and other industries at odds with a sustainable future should be supported towards alternative livelihoods.  The authors emphasize that strong political will and commitment will be required to make the needed transformations, that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, and the interventions in developed countries will look very different from those in developing countries.";"";"United Nations";"United Nations";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2019-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land governance;sustainable development";"Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1229";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1229_FutureIsNow_Science_SDGs_report_2019.pdf";"";"";"";"250";"";""
"UNCCD:1250";"Land and Soil in Europe. Why we need to use these vital and finite resources sustainably";"";"We cannot live without healthy land and soil. It is on land that we produce most of our food and we build our homes. For all species — animals and plants living on land or water — land is vital. Soil — one of the essential components of land — is a very complex and often undervalued element, teeming with life. Unfortunately, the way we currently use land and soil in Europe and in the world is not sustainable. This has significant impacts on life on land.

The EEA Signals 2019 ‘Land and soil in Europe’ explains key pressures — such as urban sprawl, contamination, intensive use of agricultural land, landscape fragmentation — impacting Europe’s land and soil. Today, artificial surfaces (buildings, roads, urban facilities) cover less than 5 % of the wider EEA territory and continue to grow despite slowing down in recent years. Almost three quarters of Europeans live in urban areas and continued urban sprawl is often threatening productive land used for farming as well as forests and other areas home to wildlife and vital ecosystems.

The report underlines that we need to preserve and protect these key resources better. For example, the way we build and connect cities should prioritise ‘land recycling’, which consists of re-using and re-purposing existing urban areas such as old industrial sites and avoid new land to be covered by concrete and asphalt. Europe’s urban population is projected to grow by 30 million by 2050.

"UNCCD:1601";"Rethinking Land in the Anthropocene: from Separation to Integration";"";"Only if there is a fundamental change in the way we manage land can we reach the targets of climate-change mitigation, avert the dramatic loss of biodiversity and make the global food system sustainable. The WBGU proposes five multiple-benefit strategies illustrating ways of overcoming competition between rival claims to the use of land. These should be promoted by five governance strategies, especially by setting suitable framework conditions, reorienting EU policy and establishing alliances of like-minded states. 

Where does international sustainability policy stand at the beginning of the 2020s? The answer is sobering. This report appraises the situation and reveals an urgent need for action by many government ministries (e.g. Environment, Education and Research, Agriculture, Development Cooperation) to develop a new approach to land stewardship: >It looks like the climate-protection goals of the Paris Agreement can only be reached if, in addition to the decarbonization of the global economy, more areas of land are used to extract carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. However, this not only offers opportunities, it also involves considerable risks. 

>The global food system is in crisis. The food security of a quarter of humanity is under threat, and another quarter suffers from unhealthy overconsumption. At the same time, the environmental damage and other external effects caused by industrial agriculture threaten our natural life-support systems, despite all past efforts – from the ‘Green Revolution’ of the 1960s and 70s to the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy. >Biodiversity is experiencing a dramatic, human-in-duced mass extinction worldwide, the scale of which has been compared with the great geological extinc-tion events of the past. This also greatly reduces the capacity of ecosystems to contribute to climate regu-lation and food security. 

In order to overcome the trilemma of land use, this report offers options for overcoming land-use competi-tion between climate-change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and food security. This requires a funda-mental change in our approach to land stewardship. The aim is to show the way forward with a combination of the exemplary multiple-benefit strategies presented above and their implementation as part of an integrated landscape approach. Almost 30 years after the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the international community has a framework of institutions at its disposal to address these problems. However, in view of the crisis of multi-lateralism, committed and rapid action by like-minded states is more important than ever. Political will, crea-tivity and courage are required for the urgently needed global transformation of land use towards  sustainability. It requires pioneers who explore and pursue new ways; states that set framework conditions, enforce the neces-sary measures and cooperate with each other; and mechanisms for achieving a fair balance between stake-holders. This can be driven forward by a supportive EU policy and a stronger focus on land in international cooperation, as well as new alliances of like-minded states. This report aims to vigorously  advocate making the global land-use transformation a political priority

The English long version of the report will be available mid 2021.

"UNCCD:1681";"Land, Women, Youths, and Land Tools or Methods";"";"The  importance  of  land  manifests  in  various  components  of  the  everyday  lives  of  people  insocieties:  cultural  heritage,  livelihood,  the  environment,  economy,  and  community,  among  manyothers.   Land  is  a  factor  of  development.   It  is  the  most  influential  determinant  of  developmentbecause  women,  youths,  and  men  (and  households)  depend  on  it  for  their  livelihoods  and  formaintaining their living conditions in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas.  However, in most cases,women and youth remain excluded from efforts towards securing land rights or the benefits that emanate from the use of land.  

This challenge persists due to a broad knowledge gap that exists on the land–women–youth–policy nexus of land management study and practice.The articles in this book explore lessons on the application of land tools (as promising solutions)for improving the living conditions of all,  including women and youths.   

Collectively,  the articles build a knowledge base for understanding the challenges that women and youths face (and possiblestrategies  to  resolve  these  challenges)  in  their  quest  to  access,  use,  and  secure  land  resources.It  also  presents  various  methods  (tools  and  approaches)  for  tackling  land  administration  and management challenges.This book reflects a broad research agenda in the field of land management and administration(including land governance and policy). It is a compendium of lessons on issues concerning women,youths,  and tools in the context of land as a sustainable factor of development.   It documents theconcepts being designed, the impacts being experienced, and the progress being made in identifyingsuitable pathways for tackling the challenges faced by women and youths in relation to land andnatural resources. Some of the studies presented in this book are adaptable to improving land-related problems in uncertain environments, such as situations that are encountered during the COVID-19or coronavirus pandemic.

The content of the book enriches the knowledge base for understanding essential changes thatare required for the empowerment of women and youths, as well as in the development of techniquesnecessary for delivering women-and-youth-responsive outcomes. The wealth of insights into how tofacilitate the implementation of methods needed for positive impacts in the land sector is a strengthof this book.  Contemporary scholars are encouraged to read the collection of articles in the book, asit will afford them free access to land governance information in their ongoing and future research";"Chigbu, Uchendu Eugene";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2021-03-31";"en";"farmers;land governance;land management;land policies;land rights;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;land use;women;youth";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1681";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1681_Land_Women_Youths_and_Land_Tools_or_Methods.pdf";"";"";"";"278";"";""
"UNCCD:200000574";"Roles of land tenure reforms and land markets in the context of population growth and land use intensification in Africa";"";"Land markets are evolving in response to increasing population pressure in Africa.
High population pressure leads to land use intensification on very small farms.
Population growth in densely populated rural areas leads to increasing rural–urban youth migration.
Tenure security enhancing land reforms enhance investments and sustainable land use intensification.
Pro-poor development strategies should target the strengthening of land governance.

This article reviews the past and potential future roles of land tenure reforms and land markets in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as responses to population growth in the process of land use intensification and livelihood transformation. The farm size distribution and the existence of an inverse relationship (IR) between farm size and land productivity in SSA and the implications of this relationship for efficiency and equity are investigated. More secure property rights and removal of restrictions on land markets have the potential to create both efficiency and equity benefits, but there are high risks of elite capture of large land areas with inefficient and inequitable outcomes. This situation is the case not only in land-abundant areas but also in urban and peri-urban areas where increasingly larger proportions of people will make their living. Increasing population pressure in densely populated rural areas contributes to more rapid rural–urban migration, and creating alternative livelihood opportunities for the migrating youth population is essential to achieving economic development with social stability.

Given the increasing scarcity of land, land tenure security must be established to achieve efficient allocation of land among farm households and to promote investment in land improvement. Endogenous evolution of property rights institutions toward individualized and secure rights has typically been slow, particularly in customary tenure systems (Otsuka and Place, 2001). Old and new power relations in the midst of the new competition for land have created serious threats to large numbers of poor rural households in many African countries. Indeed, the allocation of land to international investors has been more widespread in areas with weak land governance institutions (Deininger and Byerlee, 2011). However, land market transactions, both rentals and sales, have become more active in Africa. Obviously, governments and international organizations need to pay more attention to these land issues in SSA to protect poor and vulnerable people and promote sustainable land management. In fact, the lack of a more comprehensive understanding of the region’s land issues may have caused well-intended land reform law to fail and become subject to “elite capture” at the expense of the poor and vulnerable (Benjaminsen et al., 2009, Holden et al., 2013, Lebert and Rohde, 2007, Deininger and Byerlee, 2011). Deininger and Byerlee (2011) have shown that most of the recent large land acquisitions have taken place in areas with weak tenure systems and where customary tenure rights are not recognized in statutory law.";"Holden, Stein T.

Most  of  these  18  countries  have  farm  structures  dominated  by  smallholders  and  family  farms  or  dualistic farm structures with many small farms and few large corporate farms (FAO, 2018).Land fragmentation and small farm sizes are a fundamental structural problem   resulting   in   low   productivity   and   competitiveness   in   the   globalized  economy  (Di  Falco  et  al.    2010)  list  a  number  of  publications  confirming that land fragmentation increases production costs and leads to inefficiency. 

The structural problem with excessive land fragmentation and  small  farm  sizes  is  hampering  agriculture  and  rural  development  and  hence  also  most  initiatives  in  support  of  development.  Small-scale  agriculture  production  is  ongoing  in  subsistence  and  semi-subsistence  farms where most of the production is consumed in the household and the farms have weak access to markets and food value chains.Land fragmentation and small farm sizes are also among the root causes to out-migration from rural areas and in several countries in the region a  main  reason  for  arable  land  being  abandoned.  

In  Armenia,  according  to the 2014 Agricultural Census, 33 percent of the land of family farms and 38 percent of the land of corporate farms is abandoned (FAO, 2017a).

"UNCCD:1363";"Global Need for Food, Fibre and Fuel. Land Use Perspectives on Constraints and Opportunities in Meeting Future Demand";"";"In the last ten years or so, the global interest in, and concerns about, the issue of how the world shall provide a growing population with sufficient food, bioenergy and wood raw material has attracted increasing attention. Will land and water resources be enough, how shall they be best managed to achieve increased production and productivity without causing far-reaching negative environmental and social side-effects, will climate change make solutions more difficult, will there be financial means and know-how available to address all challenges and opportunities? 

These and other questions occupy governments, institutions and individuals around the world today. At the same time, the sense of urgency to address the situation, both locally and globally, has increased in the recent past with the surges in global food prices, the alarming apparent increase in climatic events with disastrous impact on crops and forests, the many controversial deals related to transfer of land tenure rights witnessed in Africa, etc. And, as a timely reminder of what it all boils down to, viz. the increase in number of people concerned, the global population passed the 7 billion mark just in between the two seminars reported in this publication.

Several members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (KSLA) are directly or indirectly involved in work related to the global supply of food, wood and bioenergy – as policymakers and experts at Swedish or international level, as private company and institutional leaders, and/or as scientists. 

The need to integrate water issues in land management planning is one of these cross-sectoral challenges. Another concerns the production and use of biofuels, which should be fit into an overall resource strategy, covering energy,
climate, land-use, water and agricultural issues, if their deployment is to benefit society, the economy and the environment as a whole. Land tenure issues have also come to be of particular concern in the context of global
demand for production of food, fibre and fuel since increased competition for land has placed further stresses on land tenure systems. One issue that has been widely discussed as a consequence of past years’ large-scale transnational
land acquisitions is how to secure land tenure rights for local and forest-dependent people in negotiations on land deals. In this context, water tenure must not be forgotten.";"";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2012-12-31";"en";"food security;land grabbing;land management;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1363";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1363_KSLAT-4-2012-Food-fibre-and-fuel.pdf";"";"";"";"96";"";""
"UNCCD:265";"Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply";"";"This report explores how the management of land-based biomass production and consumption can be developed towards a higher degree of sustainability across different scales: from the sustainable management of soils on the field to the sustainable management of global land use as a whole. Under business as usual conditions, the growing demand for food and non-food biomass could lead to a gross expansion of cropland in the range of 320 to 850 million hectares by 2050.
The report outlines the need and options to balance consumption with sustainable production. It focuses on land-based products, such as food, fuels and fibre, and describes methods to enable countries to determine whether their consumption levels exceed sustainable supply capacities.
At the same time it distinguishes between gross and net expansion of cropland. While net expansion is a result of rising demand for food and non-food biomass – which cannot be compensated by higher yields – gross expansion comprises the shift of cropland to other areas due to losses caused by severe degradation.
Under a business-as-usual scenario, the net expansion of cropland will range from 120 to 500 million hectares by 2050.
Shifts to more protein-rich diets in developing countries and a growing demand for biofuels and biomaterials, especially in developed countries, are increasing the demand for land.
Expansion of such magnitude is simply not compatible with the imperative of sustaining the basic life-supporting services that ecosystems provide such as maintaining soil productivity, regulating water resources, sustaining forest cover or conserving biodiversity.
The report finds that gross expansion of croplands by 2050 could be limited to somewhere between 8% and 37%, provided a multi-pronged strategy is followed for meeting the food, energy and other requirements of the global economy. Such a strategy would need to increase efficiency levels across the life cycle of agricultural commodities and also in the use and re-use of land-based resources.";"";"United Nations Environment Programme";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2014-12-31";"en";"capacity building;food security;land investments";"Land & Food Security;Land & Investments";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/265";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/265_Assessing_Global_Land_Use.pdf";"";"";"";"132";"";""

The connection between the Bonn Challenge commitments and the LDN targets could strengthen synergy and catalyse actions at national level that will help in achieving their goals in a coherent and efficient manner.The report shows that countries and their international partners need to create a policy environment conducive to supporting restoration, strengthening (inter)sectoral coordination, especially between the focal ministries of the different conventions, improving reporting and aligning investments and actions within the national restoration agendas. 

The report demonstrates that greater synergies between the LDN targets and Bonn Challenge commitments are possible and urgently required because commitments for landscape restoration under the Bonn Challenge contribute to many of the LDN goals established by countries, and vice versa. Moreover, the land-based interventions that support the achievement of these two global endeavours could also contribute to biodiversity conservation and the goals of the post-2020 biodiversity agenda, as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation. 

The report reinforces the need for improved efforts to capture the synergies between LDN and the Bonn Challenge and provides examples of the progress being made at country level. This report should provide inspiration for Country Parties to the Rio Conventions to promote synergies and improve the scale and efficiency of responses to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.";"Gichuki, L.

"UNCCD:1570";"Financing Strategies for Integrated Landscape Investment: Synthesis Report,” in Financing Strategies for Integrated Landscape Investment";"";"Policymakers and land managers around the world are struggling to use our finite land and resource base to increase agricultural production, ensure resilient ecosystems and improve livelihoods. Many are turning to integrated landscape management (ILM) as a framework for inter-sectoral planning and investments to reduce potential trade-offs and realize inherent synergies. 
ILM approaches are being applied to reduce deforestation in agricultural landscapes, increase agricultural production and water supplies by restoring degraded watersheds, and to establish biological corridors through densely populated rural regions.

Many national and international agencies have begun investing in and adopting ILM approaches, as have a growing group of pioneering private investment funds. This is encouraging, as the strained state of many public sector budgets after successive financial crises has heightened the need for a blend of both public and private finance to achieve objectives of sustainable agriculture, ecosystems and livelihoods at scale.

But while the potential rewards are increasingly clear, it is no easy task to balance the conflicting financial, environmental and social return profiles required by the different investors who are critical for landscape management. When the Landscapes for People, Food and Nature Initiative began in late 2011, it was apparent that successful ILM required access to the right kind of finance; and also that there was considerable innovation emerging in both public and private finance to address the new opportunities of ILM. However this emerging experience had not yet been assessed. 
“Financing Strategies for Integrated Landscape Investment,” developed collaboratively by the expert members of the finance working group of the LPFN, is a timely input to the vibrant dialogues about investment strategies to achieve an inclusive green economy that is resilient to climate change.

This study uncovered a wealth of models for financing ILM, and for promoting integrated investments in agriculture, ecosystems and rural development. 
The report provides a foundation for building robust investment platforms, including more effective private-public partnerships. The cases from innovative finance institutions, as well as the case studies of landscapes from Brazil, Kenya and South Africa, demonstrate promising ways to add value and attract investment that benefits people, food and nature.";"Shames, Seth

"UNCCD:200000505";"Private-sector investor’s intention and motivation to invest in Land Degradation Neutrality";"";"In this study, the authors aimed at explaining private-sector investors’ intention to invest in Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and analysing their motives for making investments that promote sustainable development. Regarding the actual intention to invest in LDN, the majority of investors showed rather weak intention to make investments that promote LDN in the near future. Interestingly, this weak intention to invest in LDN contrasts with investors’ relatively strong opinion on land degradation being a great danger to nature and humans, which also remains when comparing land degradation to other sustainable development goals (e.g. to end poverty or to promote peace). The combination of investors’ large concern about land degradation and the positive attitude towards LDN/investing sustainably with their weak intention to invest, can be seen as further evidence for the ‘sustainable investing gap’  and investors’ general uncertainty regarding investment into natural resources (incl. ‘land’-based investments)

Within the frame of this study, positive attitude reflected the investor’s belief that :

1.LDN-based investments are a promising solution to combat land degradation and promote sustainable development in the long-term,
2.investing in sustainable investment products will yield both a high financial return and have a positive impact, and
3.investment products based on the LDN concept could be an attractive investment opportunity.

Strong attitude-intention relationships have also been found in many other TPB-based studies . and are generally important for encouraging and integrating sustainability into behavior . It is important to keep in mind that sustainable investments and especially LDN are relatively new investment opportunities, which might still be perceived as risky and uncertain. Nevertheless, we argue based on our SEM results that there is great potential in promoting a positive attitude towards LDN/investing sustainably in order to reinforce investors’ attitude-intention relationships.

Investors’ knowledge about LDN and investing sustainably was a good predictor of intending to invest in LDN. Yet there is a commonly found lack of knowledge and awareness about the cross-cutting and long-term consequences of land degradation, which is one of the key drivers of land degradation in the first place (e.g. in supply systems) 

Therefore, uncertainty and lack of knowledge about the causes and effects of land degradation could impede investors’ intention to invest in LDN and further prevent potential involvement.

Addressing lack of knowledge and awareness about land degradation/LDN is essential, because investing sustainably is less likely the more barriers and uncertainty investors perceive between them and potential objects of investment Thus, spreading awareness and providing knowledge can be viewed as key factors for encouraging investors to invest in LDN.

Furthermore, we found that knowledge had highly significant positive relationships with :

1.impact investors,
2.investors who had closeness with the asset class ‘land’ (closeness-investors) and
3.investors who perceived themselves as victims of land degradation (victim-investors). 
We hypothesize that all three investor types (impact, closeness- and victim-investor) are already in a position which makes them more likely to acquire more knowledge about land degradation/LDN/investing sustainably than their counter-types (traditional investors, non-closeness and non-victims-investors). However, further research is needed to investigate this relationship.

The study suggests practical measures on how to best encourage private-sector investors to invest in LDN and, more generally, in sustainable development. This includes suggestions for how favourable circumstances can be created for investors intending to invest in emerging LDN financing vehicles:

To encourage investors to make sustainable investments that promote LDN, the first step is to promote a clear and basic understanding about :

1.the issue of land degradation,
2.how the adverse effects of land degradation might negatively affect private sector investors themselves and their businesses,
3.LDN as an effective solution to combat land degradation,
4.LDN as an investment opportunity with long-term expected return and a risk which is similar to that of other investments of similar time horizon, and
5.how investors can practically invest sustainably in LDN. Given the lack of knowledge and the high uncertainty that still surrounds the issue of land degradation, this requires above all improved and strengthened knowledge management, translation and transfer about land degradation itself.

As the determinants of the intention and the motivation to invest sustainably do not substantially differ across different investor types, investors should be targeted as a uniform group. Emphasis should be placed on the psychological determinants they commonly share, rather than on the type-specific characteristics that may distinguish different investor types.

That said, impact investors, investors who have natural resources (incl. land) as part of their investment strategy, and investors who perceive themselves as negatively affected by land degradation are still more likely to invest in LDN and thus are recommended as target groups. 

Attracting investors to engage in investing sustainably might strongly require the promotion of a consciousness for sustainability, for example by raising concern, evoking a sense of responsibility for future developments and highlighting the positive impact sustainable investments can have.

Likewise, investors’ motivation to sustainably invest can be triggered by generating an emotional attachment to the investment object (e.g. stressing how the positive outcomes of investing sustainably would benefit their significant ones).
In the context of sustainable investments, the prospect of long-term financial returns must be provided for investors, while short-term financial returns play a subordinate role.";"Reyhanloo, T.

"UNCCD:846";"The economics of desertification, land degradation and drought toward an integrated global assessment";"";"Since the publication of the Report of the Brundtland Commission (Our Common Future) in 1987, and the consequent Earth Summit on sustainable development, global attention on natural resource scarcity and degradation has been increasing, because of climate change and rising food and energy prices. This awareness, in turn, has led to growing interest in land investments by the private and public sectors. Despite this interest, however, land degradation has not been comprehensively addressed at the global level or in developing countries. A suitable economic framework that could guide investments and institutional action is lacking. This study aims to overcome this deficiency and to provide a framework for a global assessment based on a consideration of the costs of action versus inaction. 

Thus, a type of Stern Review (Stern 2006) for desertification, land degradation, and drought (DLDD) is aimed for on the basis of this study. The urgency of land degradation problems, the increased value of land, and new science insights all suggest that the time is ripe for a global assessment of the economics of DLDD (E-DLDD). Land degradation is taking place in all agroecological zones. Desertification, land degradation, and drought have long affected the world. Yet, they are increasingly considered a global problem, as their extent and impacts are increasingly affecting environmental and social vulnerability. Drought is a naturally occurring phenomenon that can accelerate desertification and land degradation. The Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research predicts an increase in the global area expected to experience severe drought at any point from 10 percent of the world‘s land surface in 2005 to 40 percent in the future for a given global warming of 3–4 degrees Celsius (Stern 2006). According to Webster et al. (2008), an increase in drought frequency is also expected (for example, an increase of 10 percent in southeastern and southern Asia and an increase of 20 percent in East Africa and Central America). In countries that heavily depend on rainfed agriculture or that have low riskbearing ability, drought leads to high economic loss and human suffering. Between 2000 and 2008, the average global annual economic cost of climate-related disasters—including drought, extreme temperatures, and wildfires—was US$9.39 billion,1 underscoring the need to enhance land users‘ ability to bear drought risks. Drought is linked to land degradation in several ways. 

However, as a recurrent fluctuation, drought requires a different type of treatment than more permanent changes, such as land degradation, in a global assessment of DLDD.";"Nkonya, Ephraim

"UNCCD:863";"ELD initiative : user guide";"";"Land degradation and desertification reduce the provision of ecosystem services by lands and soils. This constrains development, reduces water, food, and energy security, and triggers resource conflicts. Although biophysical processes and economic impacts are increasingly understood, efforts to combat degradation have been failing thus far to prevent further losses of land productivity, a cost estimated at 42 billion USD/year (Dregne & Chou, 1992; Requier-Desjardins, 2007). The on-going global reduction of land will also be felt at regional and local scales, hindering further economic development, and further aggravating the poverty and vulnerability of the rural poor, who number 35 per cent of the world’s population and additionally rely most heavily on land for their survival, sustenance, and livelihoods.
Driven by this issue and the need to address it, the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative highlights the economic dimension of soil and land degradation in order to provide methods for valuing land accurately and thus enable its efficient and sustainable use. It promotes transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of scientific insights for informed decision-making and planning, and strives to highlight the economic potential of natural resource use to foster action and support investments in their sustainable use. Based on the capital asset framework, ecosystem service framework and ‘Total Economic Value’ framework, the methodological approach promoted by the Initiative can be applied at different scales and scopes, with the aim to achieve a more holistic assessment of the value of different land use options (Noel and Soussan, 2010; ELD Initiative, 2013) for all stakeholders.

"UNCCD:870";"Land Matters for Climate Reducing the Gap and Approaching the Target";"";"The land use sector represents almost 25% of total global emissions. These emissions can be reduced. There is also great potential for carbon sequestration through the scaling up, and scaling out, of proven and effective practices. Improved land use and management, such as low-emissions agriculture, agro-forestry and ecosystem conservation and restoration could, under certain circumstances, further reduce the remaining emissions gap by up to 25%. These climate-smart land management practices nearly always come with adaptation co-benefits. Their more efficient use of resources and inputs ensure greater food and water security, and build community resilience while, at the same time, sequestering carbon.

In this brief, we identify a key element in the climate change equation often missing in the current discussions. We offer an evidence-based argument that the mitigation potential of the land use sector, realized through land rehabilitation and ecosystem restoration activities, can make a significant and immediate contribution to reducing the emissions gap. The emissions gap is the difference between the level of greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with meeting the 2°C target set by the Cancun climate change conference, and the emissions reductions that governments have committed to in their current policies.";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2015-12-31";"en";"climate change;food security;land degradation;land management";"Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/870";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/870_Land_matters_For_Climate_ENG.pdf";"";"";"";"23";"";""

In the context of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 20201, the MAES Soil Pilot provides practical guidance and capacity building to the EU institutions and Member States on methods and tools for assessing soil ecosystem services.

The process of mapping and assessing soil ecosystems and their services starts with assessing ecosystem condition. Ecosystem condition determines the capacity of an ecosystem to yield services.
Soil pressures influence the ecosystem condition and thus the potential to deliver services. Methods and data availability vary between ESS. Indicators for ecosystem condition are collected in MAES pilots for six ecosystem types: 1) Forest ecosystems, 2) Cropland and grassland ecosystems, 3) Freshwater ecosystems, 4) Marine ecosystems, 5) Urban ecosystems and 6) Soil ecosystems. 
The current report is developed in the context of the latter ecosystem. This report provides the most comprehensive overview of soil ESS.

A successful conference will go a long way towards the renewal of the UNCCD, as called for in the UNCCD’s

In the Conference of Parties’ (COP) own words, the expectations are to deliberate on “biophysical and socio economic monitoring and assessment of desertification and land degradation, to support decision-making in land and water management”.

The UNCCD realizes that it needs cutting edge science to monitor and assess DLDD. It needs this so that
the national Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification can measure DLDD more accurately and
track progress in solving it. This needs to be done in ways that can also be compiled into a global picture for our international supporters.

This UNCCD 1st Scientific Conference marks a new beginning for the Convention. The Scientific Conference stems from the 10-Year Strategic Plan and Framework for the Implementation of the Convention (2008–2018), which recognizes that we need the help of scientists to better define and measure the problems of DLDD and to inform us about the progress being made to combat the problem.";"Winslow, Mark

Hence, calls for a shift in natural resource management paradigms are justified and should prioritize political agendas.

Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) offer a promising contribution to manipulate natural resource conditions for productive purposes and human consumption, while simultaneously striving to preserve the integrity and intrinsic value of the ecosystem. 

NBS recognizes that soils are an essential and non-renewable natural resource hosting goods and services vital to ecosystems and human life. 

NBS also underpins a sustainable water management strategy that should result in a stable supply of sufficient water of a good quality to the agricultural sector. Yet, it is not easy to implement NBS based upon the few examples that have been realized so far. The reason is that ecosystems are often large and complex and the impact of interventions can only be assessed and analyzed at a system-wide level. 

As a rule, many stakeholders are involved, as owners, users or caretakers, each with their own set of interests and values and it is not an easy to reconcile these complex objectives and interests into a coherent set of principles and procedures. Simple market-based solutions such as partitioning of an ecosystem, attributing property rights and applying the polluter-pays-principle are often not sufficient for devising viable strategies.

This discussion paper, to be launched by the FAO Land and Water Division at COP24 in Katowice today, evaluated twenty-one NBS case studies using a non-representative sample, to learn from successful and failed experiences and to identify possible causalities among factors that characterize the implementation of NBS. 

The case studies give a minor role to the valuation of ecosystem services, an area for which the literature is still developing guidance. Less successful water management projects tend to suffer from inadequate factual and scientific basis and uncoordinated or insufficient stakeholder involvement and lack of long-term planning. Successful case studies point to a satisfactory understanding of the functioning of ecosystems and the importance of multi-stakeholder platforms, well-identified funding schemes, realistic monitoring and evaluation systems and endurance of its promoters.";"Sonneveld, B.G.J.S.

"UNCCD:1156";"People in marginal drylands. Managing natural resources to improve human well-being";"";"Change in land management practices and governmental policies is urgently needed to reverse the continuing decline of marginal drylands. Marginal drylands are fragile ecosystems that sustain the livelihoods of millions of poor people in developing countries. However, their capacity to provide these services is continuously declining due to desertification, resulting in dwindling land productivity, and affecting human well-being and development opportunities in many marginal drylands. 

Integrated natural resource management is the key to reducing poverty and achieving sustainable management in marginal drylands. The complexity of challenges in marginal drylands demands that strategies must be holistic and aim to alleviate wide-spread poverty, improve human well-being, restore ecosystem services and increase agricultural productivity. Their efficiency is primarily derived from diversification of income opportunities beyond traditional livelihoods coupled with empowerment and enhanced adaptive capacity of local land users. 

International investments to help create an enabling policy environment are needed to mobilize action at the global scale.
The international community, but also national governments, need to place sufficient resources at the disposal of institutions to develop and enforce coherent and integrated policy approaches across different levels. These policies must be better informed by available scientific knowledge and expertise on dryland management. Compelling arguments for these investments are the multiple benefits achieved by overcoming desertification. These include improved adaptation to climate change, mitigation of biodiversity losses, as well as poverty alleviation.";"Adeel, Zafar

A report of the Science-Policy Interface";"";"This UNCCD-SPI technical report provides well-established scientific evidence for understanding the strong linkages between land use and drought and how management of both is connected through water use. It introduces a new concept of Drought-smart land management (D-SLM) and organizes relevant approaches and practices in fourteen groups across four major classes of land use. 

The objective is to guide decision makers and land managers working on “proactive drought risk management” towards interventions designed to improve community and ecosystem resilience to drought, ideally leading to higher socioeconomic returns than conventional practices under drought conditions. It also proposes guidance for enhancing five enablers to support adoption, implementation and scaling up of D-SLM. And it brings to the forefront the need for vulnerability and risk assessments in different contexts, covering both natural (climatic, soil and water) and socioeconomic aspects of land and drought management.

Proposal  3:  Enhancing  cross-sectoral  collaboration  and  coordination  in  national,  regional  and  international  policies  and  programmes  to  promote  the  interventions  necessary  to  optimized  adoption, implementation and scaling-up of D-SLM to landscape level, focusing on a set of five enablers, including:a). Implementing integrated land use planning and landscape management;
b). Strengthening national and local capacity on the multiple benefits of D-SLM across sectors, communities of practice and disciplines, taking into consideration gender integration;
c). Ensuring effective local institutions in combination with place-based policies and legal secu-rity on land tenure and water rights to ensure relevant and inclusive design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of land-based interventions to mitigate the effects of drought;
d).  Developing  user-friendly  tools  which  improve  the  access  of  policy-makers,  planners  and  practitioners  at  all  levels  to  geospatial  analysis  that  integrates  Earth  observations,  includ-ing satellite and in-situ data of land, water and meteorology, through the use of geographic information  systems,  which  would  allow  the  integrated  monitoring  and  mapping  of  land  cover, including water bodies, land degradation and drought risk; and
e). Mobilizing both conventional and innovative finance, including from public and private inves-tors,  in  the  form  of  ecosystem  service  payments,  carbon  emission  offsetting,  insurance  coverage and investments in sustainable land-based value chains to support and promote D-SLM, ideally concurrent with local and national programming

"UNCCD:1517";"Estimating the Economic Impacts of Ecosystem Restoration—Methods and Case Studies";"";"Federal investments in ecosystem restoration projects protect Federal trusts, ensure public health and safety, and preserve and enhance essential ecosystem services. These investments also generate business activity and create jobs. It is important for restoration practitioners to be able to quantify the economic impacts of individual restoration projects in order to communicate the contribution of these activities to local and national stakeholders. This report provides a detailed description of the methods used to estimate economic impacts of case study projects and also provides suggestions, lessons learned, and trade-offs between potential analysis methods.

This analysis estimates the economic impacts of a wide variety of ecosystem restoration projects associated with U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) lands and programs. Specifically, the report provides estimated economic impacts for 21 DOI restoration projects associated with Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration cases and Bureau of Land Management lands. The study indicates that ecosystem restoration projects provide meaningful economic contributions to local economies and to broader regional and national economies, and, based on the case studies, we estimate that between 13 and 32 job-years4 and between $2.2 and $3.4 million in total economic output5 are contributed to the U.S. economy for every $1 million invested in ecosystem restoration. These results highlight the magnitude and variability in the economic impacts associated with ecosystem restoration projects and demonstrate how investments in ecosystem restoration support jobs and livelihoods, small businesses, and rural economies. In addition to providing improved information on the economic impacts of restoration, the case studies included with this report highlight DOI restoration efforts and tell personalized stories about each project and the communities that are positively affected by restoration activities. Individual case studies are provided in appendix 1 of this report and are available from an online database at https://www.fort.usgs.gov/economic-impacts-restoration.

Across the United States, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, tribes, private industries, scientists, public land managers, and private land owners are teaming up to restore the Nation’s ecosystems, thereby restoring wildlife habitat and ecosystem services lost from natural and manmade disasters and revitalizing chronically stressed ecosystems such as forests, prairies, and coastlines. This diverse set of stakeholders pool their financial resources, scientific and technical capacity, regulatory knowledge, heavy equipment and labor resources, and local environmental knowledge to unite as a coordinated system, a “restoration economy” (Baker, 2005). Together, these participants are restoring U.S. lands and waters and, in doing so, are supporting jobs and livelihoods, small businesses, and rural economies. The projects demonstrate that environmental stewardship and economic development can in fact be synergistic, as the process of ecological restoration directly contributes towards socioeconomic well-being (Baker, 2005; Goad and others, 2011; Southwick Associates, 2013; BenDor and others, 2015).

It is important for restoration practitioners to be able to quantify the economic impacts of restoration projects in order to communicate the contribution of these activities to local and national stakeholders. This information can garner support from stakeholders and can be useful for local planning and economic development agencies. Given constrained budgets and competing demands for investment, information on the economic impacts of individual restoration projects helps demonstrate the socioeconomic contributions of projects in addition to the ecological contributions. In many cases, this information can inform public stakeholders and decision makers during planning processes (for example, as part of the National Environmental Policy Act planning process).";"Thomas,Catherine Cullinane

Soil organic carbon sequestration through agricultural management has been proposed as a means to lower atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the magnitude needed to meaningfully lower temperature is unknown. The authors show that sequestration of 0.68 Pg C year−1 for 85 years could lower global temperature by 0.1°C in 2100 when combined with a low emission trajectory [Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6]. This value is potentially achievable using existing agricultural management approaches, without decreasing land area for food production. Existing agricultural mitigation approaches could lower global temperature by up to 0.26°C under RCP 2.6 or as much as 25% of remaining warming to 2°C. This declines to 0.14°C under RCP 8.5.

The authors quantify the changes in the global agricultural land footprint if the world were to adhere to the dietary guidelines put forth by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), while accounting for the land use change incurred by import/export required to meet those guidelines. The authors analyze data at country, continental, and global levels. USDA guidelines are viewed as an improvement on the current land-intensive diet of the average American, but despite this their results show that global adherence to the guidelines would require 1 gigahectare of additional land - roughly the size of Canada - under current agricultural practice. 

The results also show a strong divide between Eastern and Western hemispheres, with many Western hemisphere countries showing net land sparing under a USDA guideline diet, while many Eastern hemisphere countries show net land use increase under a USDA guideline diet. The authors conclude that national dietary guidelines should be developed using not just health but also global land use and equity as criteria. Because global lands are a limited resource, national dietary guidelines also need to be coordinated internationally, in much the same way greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly coordinated.";"Rizvi, Sarah

Here the authors present an unprecedentedly high resolution (250 × 250 m) global potential soil erosion model, using a combination of remote sensing, GIS modelling and census data. The authors challenge the previous annual soil erosion reference values as our estimate, of 35.9 Pg yr−1 of soil eroded in 2012, is at least two times lower. 

Moreover, the authors estimate the spatial and temporal effects of land use change between 2001 and 2012 and the potential offset of the global application of conservation practices. Their findings indicate a potential overall increase in global soil erosion driven by cropland expansion. The greatest increases are predicted to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. The least developed economies have been found to experience the highest estimates of soil erosion rates.

"UNCCD:200000271";"Can strategic spatial planning contribute to land degradation reduction in urban regions? State of
the art and future research";"";"Land degradation is becoming a serious environmental issue threatening fertile agricultural soils and other natural resources. There are many driving forces behind land degradation. The expansion of artificial surfaces due to various economic activities, such as housing, industry, and transport infrastructure, known as soil sealing, constitutes one of the most intensive forms of land degradation in urban regions. Measures to halt and reverse land degradation require both strong land-use management policies, as well as effective spatial planning mechanisms. 

In this regard, strategic spatial planning has been increasingly practised in many urban regions worldwide, as a means to achieve sustainable land-use patterns and to guide the location of development and physical infrastructures. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that strategic spatial planning can counteract the outlined undesired land degradation effects, specifically those resulting from soil sealing. In this paper, we review strategic spatial planning literature published between 1992 and 2017. 

The focus is on the phenomena causing land degradation that are addressed by strategic spatial planning literature, as well as on the mechanisms describing the role of strategic spatial planning in land degradation reduction. Results show that sustainable development and environmental concerns have become core objectives of strategic planning in recent years, yet references to the drivers of land degradation are rare. The mechanisms that exist are mainly intended to address environmental issues in general, and are not aimed at reducing particular forms of land degradation. 

The paper concludes by sketching future research directions, intended to support strategic spatial planning and land-use policymaking related to coping with the global phenomenon of land degradation.";"Oliveira, Eduardo

"UNCCD:200000336";"Functional Land Management conceptual framework under soil
drainage and land use scenarios";"";"Agricultural soils offer multiple soil functions, which contribute to a range of ecosystem services, and the demand for the primary production function is expected to increase with a growing world population. Other key functions on agricultural land have been identified as water purification, carbon sequestration, habitat biodiversity and nutrient cycling, which all need to be considered for sustainable intensification. 

All soils perform all functions simultaneously, but the variation in the capacity of soils to supply these functions is reviewed in terms of defined land use types (arable, bio-energy, broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, managed grassland, other grassland and Natura 2000) and extended to include the influence of soil drainage characteristics (well, moderately/imperfect, poor and peat). This latter consideration is particularly important in the European Atlantic pedo-climatic zone; the spatial scale of this review. 

This review develops a conceptual framework on the multi-functional capacity of soils, termed Functional Land Management, to facilitate the effective design and assessment of agri-environmental policies. A final functional soil matrix is presented as an approach to show the consequential changes to the capacity of the five soil functions associated with land use change on soils with contrasting drainage characteristics. Where policy prioritises the enhancement of particular functions, the matrix indicates the potential trade-offs for individual functions or the overall impact on the multi-functional capacity of soil. 

The conceptual framework is also applied by land use area in a case study, using the Republic of Ireland as an example, to show how the principle of multi-functional land use planning can be readily implemented.";"Coyle, Cait

Considering this fact, the Government of Ethiopia started the Rural Land Registration and Certification Programme (RLRCP) since 1998/99 to provide land titling and tenure security to the farmers.

"UNCCD:627";"Growth and poverty in Sub - Saharan Africa";"";"While the economic growth renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa is widely recognized, much less is known about progress in living conditions. This book comprehensively evaluates trends in living conditions in 16 major sub-Saharan African countries, corresponding to nearly 75% of the total population. A striking diversity of experience emerges. While monetary indicators improved in many countries, others are yet to succeed in channeling the benefits of economic growth into the pockets of the poor. Some countries experienced little economic growth, and saw little material progress for the poor. At the same time, the large majority of countries have made impressive progress in key non-monetary indicators of wellbeing.
Overall, the African growth renaissance earns two cheers, but not three. While gains in macroeconomic and political stability are real, they are also fragile. Growth on a per capita basis is much better than in the 1980s and 1990s, yet not rapid compared with other developing regions. Importantly from a pan-African perspective, key economies-particularly Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa-are not among the better performers.
Looking forward, realistic expectations are required. The development process is, almost always, a long hard slog. Nevertheless, real and durable factors appear to be at play on the sub-continent with positive implications for growth and poverty reduction in future.(open access book Oxford University Press)

"UNCCD:1648";"Mainstreaming youth in IFAD operations: A practitioner’s guide";"";"The failure of rural economies to deliver decent work to their young people affects national economies, threatens political stability, nurtures extremism and causes socially and economically disruptive migration. Globally, youth are two to three times more likely than adults to be unemployed.

Rural youth, especially young women and girls, are often excluded from participation in organizational structures, decision-making and leadership of political processes. Rural young women and girls also have additional burdens related to early marriage and pregnancy, leading to further exclusion due to intergenerational cycles of malnutrition and poverty.

Overall, rural young people have limited access to opportunities and resources such as land ownership, water, markets and finance – yet they have the potential to become the driving force for inclusive rural transformation. Creating decent job opportunities for rural young women and men and tapping into their potential for innovation and entrepreneurship can generate significant social and economic returns for rural areas in the developing world, making it an effective target for development cooperation.

Depending on the context, this can include young people with disabilities, young people from minority ethnic and religious groups, geographically isolated young people, and many others.

This report offers practical guidance on how IFAD can support the engagement of marginalized young people, paying specific attention to their diverse and complex needs and addressing the real causes of their discrimination.

"UNCCD:400000186";"Gender Inequalities in Ownership and Control of Land in Africa: Myths versus reality";"";"Over the past decade, stakeholders have made a variety of generalized claims concerning women’s landownership, both globally and in Africa. Typically, these claims include statements with single statistics, such as “women own less than 2 percent of the world’s land” or “women own approximately 15 percent of land in Africa south of the Sahara.” These claims are problematic because they are not substantiated by empirical evidence, do not reflect variations in landownership across or within countries, do not acknowledge differences in landownership regimes, nor address comparative ownership by men in the same contexts. Neither do they address the difference between ownership and control of land. The lack of a clear understanding behind statistics on gender and land also leads to an inability to clearly articulate a policy response to the potential inequalities faced by women and men. The objective of this paper is to explore, conceptually and empirically, the levels and relative inequalities in landownership between women and men in African countries.";"Doss, Cheryl

The results show large gender gaps in landownership across countries. However, critical data gaps cloud our understanding of land rights and why women fare better or worse in certain countries.

"UNCCD:3";"Multifunctional rural land management: Economics and policies";"";"The increasing demand for rural land and its natural resources is creating competition and conflicts. Many interested parties, including farmers, nature conservationists, rural residents and tourists, compete for the same space. Especially in densely populated areas, agriculture, recreation, urban and suburban growth and infrastructure development exert a constant pressure on rural areas.
Because land is a finite resource, spatial policies which are formulated and implemented to increase the area allocated to one use imply a decrease in land available for other uses. As a result, at many locations, multi-purpose land use is becoming increasingly important. This notion of multi-purpose land use is reflected in the term multifunctionality. This volume provides insights into viable strategies of sustainable management practices allowing multiple functions sustained by agriculture and natural resources in rural areas. It shows how the rural economy and policies can balance and cope with these competing demands and includes numerous case studies from Europe, North America and developing countries.See the content for a reference.";"Brouwer, Floor

The three-day event was organized by FAO, in collaboration with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP), with support from a Steering Committee composed of
dedicated colleagues from the three Rome-based agencies (RBAs).Knowledge gaps were identified; in particular the need to ensure that all technical knowledge be “people-centred”. As such, the real challenge is to allow existing tools and knowledge to be linked strategically to facilitate better integration between biophysical and socio-economic information.
Stakeholder engagement and participation, as well as negotiation amongst different interests, that are not limited to the agriculture sector, are central to addressing land and water issues. Finally, it is important to communicate effectively with policy makers to ensure more effective policy reforms and programmes.
The exacerbation of the linkages between water scarcity and land degradation, food security and nutrition, with recurrent shocks and emerging issues, such as human mobility and migration, rural youth unemployment, and lack of social protection, were among the topics debated needing more attention. In fact, when designing projects, it is crucial to take into account the complexity of the situation in a given context and use a multisectorial approach in mainstreaming land and water actions.
Three main overarching themes – governance, integrated approaches and climate change/risk and resilience – were at the centre of the three-day event. Experts from across FAO, IFAD, WFP Headquarters and Country Offices, and project partners, shared the challenges they face in linking land and water governance across scales (from local, to national, to global levels), presented the different integrated approaches they developed and are currently working on, and discussed the ever growing challenges faced by the agriculture
sector in view of the new realities of climate change and resilience building.
Participants raised many issues and concerns regarding the complexity of achieving the highest awareness possible in order for policy makers to give priority to water scarcity and land degradation to ensure sustainable food production, as these are receiving inadequate attention compared to some other sectors that receive subsidy, such as energy and health.

"UNCCD:814";"Scientific Conceptual Framework for Land Degradation Neutrality. A Report of the Science-Policy Interface.";"";"The Scientific Conceptual Framework for Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) provides a scientific foundation for understanding, implementing and monitoring LDN. It has been designed to create a bridge between the vision and the practical implementation of LDN, by defining LDN in operational terms. The conceptual framework is a product of the UNCCD Science-Policy Interface. 

Pursuit of LDN requires effort to avoid further net loss of the land-based natural capital relative to a reference state, or baseline. Planning for neutrality involves counterbalancing anticipated losses with measures to achieve equivalent gains, within individual land types, where land type is defined by land potential. Integration of planning for LDN interventions into existing land use planning is encouraged. Particular attention is paid to projecting and tracking the likely cumulative impacts of land use and land management decisions.

Actions to achieve LDN include land management approaches that avoid or reduce degradation, coupled with efforts to reverse degradation through restoration or rehabilitation of land that has lost productivity. The response hierarchy of Avoid >Reduce > Reverse land degradation articulates the priorities in planning LDN interventions. The implementation of LDN is managed at the landscape scale, considering all land units of each land type and their interactions and ecological trajectories, so that LDN interventions can be optimized among those land units, in order to maintain or exceed no net loss, per land type. 

Monitoring achievement of neutrality will quantify the balance between the area of gains (significant positive changes in LDN indicators =improvements) and area of losses (significant negative changes in LDN  indicators=degradation), within each land type across the landscape. The LDN indicators (and associated metrics) are land cover (land cover change), land productivity (net primary production) and carbon stocks (soil organic carbon). The LDN conceptual framework is designed to be applicable to all land uses (i.e., land managed for production–e.g., agriculture, forestry; for conservation–e.g., protected areas; and also land occupied by human settlements and infrastructure); and all types of land degradation, across the wide variety of countries’ circumstances, so that it can be implemented in a harmonized fashion by all countries that choose to pursue LDN. It helps build the bridge between the vision and the practical implementation of LDN through National Action Programmes, by defining LDN in operational terms.

It is a process framework that captures the vision of what LDN is intended to achieve, and, based on this, provides guidance on how best to assess land degradation and identify appropriate management actions, and ultimately report on progress in achieving LDN.

A technical guide on valuing land tenure rights in line with the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security";"";"Valuations  of  tenure  rights  are  required  by  the  State  and  by  the  private  sector  for  a  wide  variety  of  reasons,  often  forming  and  informing  the  basis  of  transactions,  taxation,  compensation  and  accounting.  Value  and  the  valuation  process  form  a  part of our everyday lives, and yet these are often shrouded in mystery and are not clearly understood. 
Valuation is not merely hypothetical – a significant proportion of complaints and legal challenges in many countries are grounded on valuation, be it claims of inadequate levels of compensation for land taken by the State, or resistance to high land and property taxes, all of which have legal and financial consequences.

The Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests  in  the  Context  of  National  Food  Security  (hereafter  the  Guidelines)  endorsed  in  2012,  are  the  first  international  consensus  on  the  centrality  of  tenure  rights.  They  enforce the recognition and protection of tenure rights and the importance of tenure security  to  national  food  security.  The  Guidelines  recognize  the  complexities  of  effective land administration associated with the delivery of tenure-related services and specifically reference the importance of valuation.

The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  has  developed  a  series  of  Technical  Guides  to  elaborate  and  provide  more  detailed  guidance  on  thematic areas contained within the Guidelines. As part of this series, this Technical Guide covers the issues associated with the identification and valuation of tenure rights for different purposes, and provides guidance on how to ensure that valuations are undertaken in a fair, reliable and transparent manner that comply with international norms.  It  explains  why  valuations  are  important,  where  and  when  they  should  be  used, and by whom. It is not intended to be a valuation textbook; instead it seeks to raise the level of awareness of valuation issues and procedures among those involved in land policy and administration and those affected by land tenure decisions.

Historic decision on land tenure adopted by UNCCD COP 14 ​​​​​​​. During a high-level session at the close of the UNCCD COP 14 (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Conference of the Parties) in September, a declaration to focus on land-based solutions to combat climate change was adopted. In the declaration, the relevance of the VGGT was reaffirmed for better access, control and stewardship over land and equitable tenure security. It encourages parties to use the principles laid out in the VGGT in the implementation of activities to combat desertification/land degradation and drought.  In closing the session Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, emphasized that the key message to the upcoming UN climate summit in New York was clear, “investing in land, unlocks multiple opportunities.”

FAO was invited to produce a technical guide on integrating the VGGT into the implementation of the Convention and land degradation neutrality, taking into account national contexts for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its fifteenth session.

"UNCCD:1686";"Seizing the Urban Opportunity. How national governments can recover from COVID-19, secure shared prosperity, and tackle the climate crisis through cities.";"";"Today, the Coalition for Urban Transitions releases a new report ‘Seizing the Urban Opportunity’, which provides insights from six emerging economies on how national governments can recover from COVID-19, tackle the climate crisis and secure shared prosperity through cities. Launching as a call to action for national governments ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, it builds on the Coalition’s flagship 2019 report: Climate Emergency, Urban Opportunity.

Facts and figures:
# Urban areas produce 80% of global GDP, and as of 2020, were home to about 56% of humankind.
Recognising that developing and emerging economies face particularly complex challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, Seizing the Urban Opportunity focuses on: 

# Six major emerging economies: China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. 

These countries represent about :
# 1/3 of global GDP, 
# 42% of the world’s urban population, and 
# 41% of global fossil fuel emissions. 

#The report finds that the six countries could collectively cut emissions by up to 96% from key urban sectors (buildings, transport, materials use, and waste) by 2050, lead to $12 trillion in economic returns based on cost savings alone and deliver millions of new jobs.

National governments can spur COVID-19 recovery, achieve shared prosperity and drive climate action through national policies and targeted investments to decarbonise cities and make them more resilient. This report shows the power of urban transformation and the many ways to achieve it by looking up close at six major emerging economies: China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa.

Cities are vital to solving the triple challenges of COVID-19 recovery, sustainable and inclusive development, and climate change; but they need national leadership and support to realise their potential.

This new report builds on previous research from our 2019 flagship report, Climate Emergency, Urban Opportunity, which found that national governments hold the key to urban transformations as they drive or control key policy realms and are responsible for mobilising resources at the scale needed.

This is a pivotal time for national governments, as the choices they make amid the COVID crisis can put their countries on track for a more prosperous and resilient future, or accelerate the climate emergency.

By 2030, investment in urban infrastructure must be directed towards zero-carbon, resilient, and inclusive development if cities are to reach their potential for delivering the emission reductions needed for a well below 2°C climate scenario. This report seeks to build momentum for enhanced climate ambition by national governments and other actors ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.

Recognising that developing and emerging economies face particularly complex challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, the report focuses on six key countries: China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. Together, they produce about a third of global GDP and 41% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use.

They are also home to 42% of the world’s urban population. The extent to these six major emerging economies can unleash the power of cities to catalyse sustainable, inclusive and resilient growth is therefore critical not only for their future trajectory, but for the whole planet.

Across the six countries studied, implementation of the report’s solutions, using currently available measures, could collectively support:

    Climate benefits, including cutting annual emissions from key urban sectors (buildings, transport, materials use and waste) by 87–96% by 2050 beyond their initial NDC commitments under the Paris Agreement.
    Economic benefits including economic returns with a net present value of over $12 trillion by 2050, based on energy and material cost savings alone.
    Development benefits including potentially supporting millions of new jobs in 2030: 15.2 million in China, 8.2 million in India, 2.3 million in Indonesia, 4.5 million in Brazil, 650,000 in South Africa, and 500,000 in Mexico.

The report finds that these solutions could collectively support significant economic and development benefits, and cut annual emissions from key urban sectors by 87–96% by 2050 beyond their initial NDC commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The report is a collaborative effort, created in consultation with experts and policymakers in the six focus countries, with additional input from more than 36 organisations across five continents.

The ‘Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey Soil’ (LUCAS Soil) is an extensive and regular topsoil survey that is carried out across the European Union to derive policy-relevant statistics on the effect of land management on soil characteristics. Approximately 45 000 soil samples have been collected from two time-periods, 2009–2012 and 2015. A new sampling series will be undertaken in 2018, with new measurements included.

The organization for the 2018 sampling campaign represents an opportunity to summarize past LUCAS Soil achievements and present its future objectives. In 2009–2012 and 2015, LUCAS Soil surveys targeted physicochemical properties, including pH, organic carbon, nutrient concentrations and cation exchange capacity. Data from 2009–2012 (ca. 22 000 points) and derived output (more than 20 maps) are available freely from the European Soil Data Centre website. Analyses of samples collected during 2015 are ongoing and data will be available at the end of 2017. In the 2018 LUCAS Soil sampling campaign, additional properties, including bulk density, soil biodiversity, specific measurements for organic-rich soil and soil erosion will be measured. 

Here the authors present the current dataset (LUCAS Soil 2009–2012 and 2015), its potential for reuse and future development plans (LUCAS Soil 2018 and over). LUCAS Soil represents the largest harmonized open-access dataset of topsoil properties available for the European Union at the global scale. It was developed as an expandable resource, with the possibility to add new properties and sampling locations during successive sampling campaigns. Data are available to the scientific community and decision makers, thus contributing to both research and the development of the land-focused policy agenda.";"Orgiazzi, A.

With an increasing awareness of the potential of land to meet public and private development goals, land is being seen as an ever more attractive investment vehicle.
The vision for financing sustainable development outlined in this brochure seeks to leverage the longterm potential of human, financial, and natural capital to improve the health and productivity of land and soil, and to serve as a catalyst for making progress towards many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It makes a compelling case, in particular, that by investing in land degradation neutrality, we can reap significant rewards. The value of terrestrial ecosystem goods and services goes beyond what the land provides for important sectors, such as food, water and forestry. 
Recognizing that trade-offs among competing land-use sectors such as agriculture, industry, urbanization and tourism are somehow inevitable; economic assessments and approaches to managing and investing in land resources should aim to understand the total range of values that are important to the entire society.
Investing in SLM is both an affordable and a low-risk proposition. More financing is needed to support scaling up of SLM but this can mostly come from existing sources. In the scaling up of SLM and achieving LDN, the public sector should focus on mainstreaming SLM into existing policies, providing the enabling environment and driving institutional and policy reform.

"UNCCD:950";"Summary for policymakers of the assessment report on land degradation and restoration of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)";"";"Land degradation is a pervasive, systemic phenomenon: it occurs in all parts of the terrestrial world and can take many forms. Combating land degradation and restoring degraded land is an urgent priority to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services vital to all life on Earth and to ensure human well-being

Currently, degradation of the Earth’s land surface through human activities is negatively impacting the well-being of at least 3.2 billion people, pushing the planet towards a sixth mass species extinction, and costing more than 10 per cent of the annual global gross product in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Loss of ecosystem services through land degradation has reached high levels in many parts of the world, resulting in negative impacts that challenge the coping capacity of human ingenuity. 

Groups in situations of vulnerability feel the greatest negative effects of land degradation, and often experience them first. These groups also see the greatest benefits from avoiding, reducing and reversing land degradation (Figure SPM.1). 

The main direct drivers of land degradation and associated biodiversity loss are expansion of crop and grazing lands into native vegetation, unsustainable agricultural and forestry practices, climate change, and, in specific areas, urban expansion, infrastructure development and extractive industry.

Investing in avoiding land degradation and the restoration of degraded land makes sound economic sense; the benefits generally by far exceed the cost. Land degradation contributes to the decline and eventual extinction of species and the loss of ecosystem services to humanity, making avoidance, reduction and reversal of land degradation essential for human well-being. Main cause of species loss & driver of the migration of millions of people by 2050 In landmark 3-year assessment report, 100+ experts outline costs, dangers & options Issued by the IPBES secretariat on 23 March 2018. 

Options for Land Restoration

The report notes that successful examples of land restoration are found in every ecosystem, and that many well-tested practices and techniques, both traditional and modern, can avoid or reverse degradation.

In croplands, for instance, some of these include reducing soil loss and improving soil health, the use of salt tolerant crops, conservation agriculture and integrated crop, livestock and forestry systems.

In rangelands with traditional grazing, maintenance of appropriate fire regimes, and the reinstatement or development of local livestock management practices and institutions have proven effective.

Successful responses in wetlands have included control over pollution sources, managing the wetlands as part of the landscape, and reflooding wetlands damaged by draining.

In urban areas, urban spatial planning, replanting with native species, the development of ‘green infrastructure’ such as parks and riverways, remediation of contaminated and sealed soils (e.g. under asphalt), wastewater treatment and river channel restoration are identified as key options for action.

be used to guide the 2012–2013 reporting and review process.

The UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) was commissioned to provide
technical support and backstopping for this Pilot, under the leadership of the UNCCD Secretariat and
with guidance from the UNCCD’s CST Bureau.

The Pilot took place between July and October 2011, with participation from the following countries:
Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, China, Colombia, Mexico, Portugal, Senegal, Spain, South Africa and Tunisia.
It involved a series of multi-national and national activities which aimed to produce evidence, examples
and recommendations on national reporting against the impact indicators.

The Pilot aimed to review the UNCCD’s impact indicators which have been developed in line with the
Convention’s 10-year Strategic Plan and its newly adopted results-based management approach which is
now used to monitor and assess implementation of the Convention in addressing sustainable land and
ecosystem management, poverty reduction and delivering global environmental benefits.";"Schulte-Herbrüggen, B.

"UNCCD:991";"Zero Net Land Degradation: A New Sustainable Development Goal for Rio+ 20";"";"This report suggests that a new and explicit goal of sustainable development to be agreed as a result of Rio+20 should be the reduction of the rate of land degradation to achieve land degradation neutrality, which we refer to as “Zero Net Land Degradation” or ZNLD. Such a goal is urgently required in order to save the world‟s lands from further degradation processes and thus to meet the nutritional, economic, social and cultural needs of current and future generations, as well as to complement global initiatives to address climate change and biological diversity losses The objective of this report is to explain and justify the need for setting a ZNLD target, and to suggest ways in which it can be achieved. To this end, a tentative roadmap is included as part of the recommendations of the report.

The principal driver of human-caused land degradation and desertification is unsustainable exploitation of land productivity by pastoral, farming and agro-pastoral land uses. By restoring already degraded land, the net rate of loss of productive land can be reduced to zero. If the annual rate of restoration over time equals the annual rate of land becoming degraded, zero net land degradation will be achieved. The fundamental aim of ZNLD is thus that the area of global productive land will remain stable with enhanced and sustained production. Promoting the ZNLD target would help to secure the currently available productive land for the use of present and future generations.

Land degradation and its subset of desertification are defined in the box below. In this report they are collectively referred to as “LDD”. They constitute a persistent decline in the provision of all services that land would otherwise provide, including food provision. Around 20% of global land area is presumably already degraded (i.e. LDD-affected), as expressed by a persistent reduction of land productivity as well as in the provision of other land ecosystem services .";"Lal, Rattan

"UNCCD:1072";" IPBES assessment report on land degradation and restoration";"";"Land degradation is a pervasive, systemic phenomenon: it occurs in all parts of the terrestrial world and can take many forms. Combating land degradation and restoring degraded land is an urgent priority to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services vital to all life on Earth and to ensure human well-being

Currently, degradation of the Earth’s land surface through human activities is negatively impacting the well-being of at least 3.2 billion people, pushing the planet towards a sixth mass species extinction, and costing more than 10 per cent of the annual global gross product in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Loss of ecosystem services through land degradation has reached high levels in many parts of the world, resulting in negative impacts that challenge the coping capacity of human ingenuity. 

Groups in situations of vulnerability feel the greatest negative effects of land degradation, and often experience them first. These groups also see the greatest benefits from avoiding, reducing and reversing land degradation (Figure SPM.1). 

The main direct drivers of land degradation and associated biodiversity loss are expansion of crop and grazing lands into native vegetation, unsustainable agricultural and forestry practices, climate change, and, in specific areas, urban expansion, infrastructure development and extractive industry.

Investing in avoiding land degradation and the restoration of degraded land makes sound economic sense; the benefits generally by far exceed the cost. Land degradation contributes to the decline and eventual extinction of species and the loss of ecosystem services to humanity, making avoidance, reduction and reversal of land degradation essential for human well-being.

Options for Land Restoration

The report notes that successful examples of land restoration are found in every ecosystem, and that many well-tested practices and techniques, both traditional and modern, can avoid or reverse degradation.

In croplands, for instance, some of these include reducing soil loss and improving soil health, the use of salt tolerant crops, conservation agriculture and integrated crop, livestock and forestry systems.

In rangelands with traditional grazing, maintenance of appropriate fire regimes, and the reinstatement or development of local livestock management practices and institutions have proven effective.

Successful responses in wetlands have included control over pollution sources, managing the wetlands as part of the landscape, and reflooding wetlands damaged by draining.";"Montanarella, Luca

"UNCCD:1484";"Salinization in Drylands";"";"Most commonly in drylands the salinity levels are always high and evenly dispersed due to this salinity levels the plant cultivated are usually tremendously affected. Normal plants cannot grow in soils with high salinity levels. In this book the authors would like to analyze the effects of human acticities on the salinity lebvels in drylands.

Dryland salinity is a natural process for soil, just like other processes such as wind erosion. Salinity degrades land by an increase in soil salt concentration in the environment, watercourse or soil in unirrigated landscapes, being in excess of normal soil salt concentrations in dryland regions.

Land productivity may be limited in salt-affected areas due to the toxicity of dissolved salts for plants or due to the destruction of soil structure that then restricts water infiltration capacity. Soil salinity is site-specific. Interventions may be prohibitively expensive and must be carefully managed. Saline soils may be treated by improving sub-surface drainage and applying sufficient water to move salts out of the root zone. Sodic or alkali soils can be treated through the application of chemicalbiological amendments, such as gypsum, along with organic manure. 

Adoption of crop-rotation systems using salt-tolerant crops (halophytes), followed by legumes and avoiding fallow periods may improve the soil resource. For example, Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd), a salt-tolerant crop, is widely used in saline environments.

A large proportion of salt-affected soils in irrigated areas occur on small farms with limited access to resources. Many affected farmers must supplement their low on-farm income with off-farm economic activities. This potentially limits their ability to invest in many salinity management opportunities. 

Although salt-affected soils are of low fertility and limited agricultural value, they can provide an alternative resource for growing biomass for renewable energy.

"UNCCD:1531";"Good practice guidance SDG Indicator 15.3.1. Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area";"";"In the last decade, there have been a number of global/regional targets and initiatives to halt and reverse land degradation and restore degraded land. Starting in 2010, these include the CBD’s Aichi Biodiversity Targets, one of which aims to restore at least 15% of degraded ecosystems; the Bonn Challenge and its regional initiatives to restore more than 150 million hectares; and most recently the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The SDGs provide a framework for countries to determine how best to improve the lives of their people now while ensuring that these improvements are sustained for future generations. The SDGs came into effect in January 2016 and are expected to guide social, economic and environmental policy and investment over the next 15 years. SDG 15 promotes “Life on Land” and SDG target 15.3 states:
‘By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world.’

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is the custodian agency for SDG indicator 15.3.1 (“Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”) which was proposed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) in March 2017 to monitor progress towards achieving SDG target 15.3.

The UNCCD and its key partner, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), have convened an inter-agency advisory group to develop and refine the methodology and data options contained in this Good Practice Guidance (GPG) for SDG indicator 15.3.1. The group also includes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Environment (UNEP) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).

SDG indicator 15.3.1 will be reported as a binary (i.e., degraded/not degraded) quantification based primarily, and to the largest extent possible, on comparable and standardized national official data sources. This GPG aims to assist countries in implementing the methodology for deriving SDG indicator 15.3.1 (“the indicator”) by calculating and assessing changes in i) land cover, ii) land productivity and iii) carbon stocks (“the sub-indicators”) in concert.
The methodology is intended to be universal, allowing countries to select the most appropriate datasets for the sub-indicators and determine the most suitable pathway for deriving the indicator. This GPG also recognizes that any significant negative change in the sub-indicators pointing to land degradation is context specific and to be determined by national authorities based on a convergence of evidence, i.e, complemented with other indicators, data and information.

This GPG describes the methods to process and interpret data from available sources that can be used to support countries in their assessment and quantification of land degradation. While it difficult for a single indicator to fully capture the state or condition of the land, the sub-indicators are proxies to monitor the key factors and driving variables that reflect the capacity of the land to deliver ecosystem services. In this regard, this GPG assists countries in accessing and interpreting a wide range of data sources for the sub-indicators, including Earth observation and geospatial information, while at the same time ensuring national ownership. The UNCCD reporting template includes the indicator and sub-indicators. Thus, the use of the UNCCD’s national reports provides a practical and harmonized approach by which countries can report on the indicator beginning in 2018 and every four years thereafter.1

The quantitative assessments and corresponding mapping at the national level, as required by the indicator, will help countries to set policy and planning priorities among diverse land resource areas, in particular to (1) identify hotspots and plan actions of redress, including through the conservation, rehabilitation, restoration and sustainable management of land resources, and (2) address emerging pressures in order to help avoid future land degradation.

The One Out, All Out (1OAO)12 principle is applied taking into account changes in the sub-indicators which are depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or unchanging. If one of the sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a particular land unit, then it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities.

"UNCCD:1600";"Exploring future changes in land use and land condition and the impacts on food, water, climate change and biodiversity: Scenarios for the UNCCD Global Land Outlook";"";"The pressure on land is growing in many regions of the world, due to the increasing demand for arable crops, meat and dairy products, bio-energy and timber, and is exacerbated by land degradation and climate change. This policy report provides scenario projections for the UNCCD Global Land Outlook, exploring future changes to the use and condition of land and the resulting impacts on food, water, climate change and biodiversity.

Land management plays a central role in the Sustainable Development Goals
Land is a major overarching theme connecting the three Rio Conventions covering climate change (UNFCCC), biodiversity (CBD), and desertification and land degradation (UNCCD).
Furthermore, a large number of the Sustainable Development Goals have strong links to land and land management, and trade-offs between sustainability ambitions often materialise on land.

Scenario projections for the UNCCD's Global Land Outlook
The PBL-study explores how various demands on land are expected to change under alternative future developments up to 2050, how that will affect the challenges facing global sustainability ambitions, and the extent to which land degradation may exacerbate these challenges. It provides policymakers with quantitative information on the order of magnitude of future change to the land system, and may support the debate on policy priorities and interventions.

Largest challenges for Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East/Northern Africa and South Asia
These regions are characterised by a combination of land-related challenges which are much more serious than those faced by other regions. These consist of high levels of population growth (also in  drylands), low current levels of GDP per capita, generally low crop yields, intense pressure on agricultural expansion, marked increases in water stress, and a dependency on food imports from other regions.

Negative trends in productivity and soil condition due to land management practices are most severe in Sub-Saharan Africa. In all three regions, the strongly increasing pressure on land makes land management key to maintain ecosystem functions for the benefit of 4.9agriculture and the water cycle.

This study was conducted at the request of the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in support of the Global Land Outlook. The research and modelling was developed by PBL in cooperation with many experts from various institutions, including Wageningen University, Utrecht University, Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Wageningen Economic Research, and ISRIC World Soil Information.

"UNCCD:1658";"Land Degradation Neutrality Fund. LDN Impact Monitoring Methodology. Technical Document";"";"As investments in nature are needed more than ever, and are increasingly gaining traction, the challenge is to identify environmental and social risks and to demonstrate positive impacts associated with investing in nature-based projects in a standardized and comparable manner. To help create a clear track record of projects that can be assessed on risk-return-impact profiles, a certain degree of standardization is needed, while maintaining scientific rigor.

The LDN TAF therefore supported the LDN Fund in developing a methodology for measuring and tracking progress on LDN impact at investment project level, directly tied to SDG target 15.3. This was done by partnering with Trends.Earth, an initiative by Conservation International, GlobalGeoHub, and in close consultation with the UNCCD scientific community. Building on the UNCCD’s LDN Scientific Conceptual Framework, the methodology looks at three sub-indicators: land cover, land productivity, and soil organic carbon (SOC).

Based on a one-out-all-out principle (each of the three LDN sub-indicators needs to showcase either a stabilization or improvement), a positive overall change indicates land increasing in productivity and health, and land degradation being reversed. Most indicators are measured using remotely sensed satellite imagery, complemented for selected cases by field-level soil sampling. The LDN TAF supports investees of the LDN Fund in setting an LDN baseline using this methodology, while building capacity with project developers to integrate continuous monitoring of LDN into their operations, and (if relevant) aligning this work with local government target setting units. This not only allows companies to report on progress and comply with environmental and social action plans, it also enables them to practice adaptive management, minimizing land degradation risk and optimizing positive environmental, social and financial returns resulting from restoring land.";"Zvoleff, Alex

"UNCCD:1664";"Food System Impacts on Biodiversity Loss. Three Levers for Food System Transformation in Support of Nature";"";"This paper explores the role of the global food system as the principal driver of accelerating biodiversity loss. It explains how food production is degrading or destroying natural habitats and contributing to species extinction. The paper outlines the challenges and trade-offs involved in redesigning food systems to restore biodiversity and/or prevent further biodiversity loss, and presents recommendations for action.

The paper introduces three ‘levers’ for reducing pressures on land and creating a more sustainable food system. The first is to change dietary patterns to reduce food demand and encourage more plant-based diets. The second is to protect and set aside land for nature, whether through re-establishing native ecosystems on spared farmland or integrating pockets of natural habitat into farmland. The third is to shift to more sustainable farming. All three levers will be needed for food system redesign to succeed.

Our recommendations for action are based around a series of major summits and conferences on food systems, climate, biological diversity, nutrition and related areas scheduled in 2021. These offer a unique opportunity for a ‘food systems approach’ to become embedded in international policy processes.

    Biodiversity loss is accelerating around the world. The global rate of species extinction today is orders of magnitude higher than the average rate over the past 10 million years.
    The global food system is the primary driver of this trend. Over the past 50 years, the conversion of natural ecosystems for crop production or pasture has been the principal cause of habitat loss, in turn reducing biodiversity.
    Our food system has been shaped over past decades by the ‘cheaper food’ paradigm. Policies and economic structures have aimed to produce ever more food at ever lower cost. Intensified agricultural production degrades soils and ecosystems, driving down the productive capacity of land and necessitating even more intensive food production to keep pace with demand. Growing global consumption of cheaper calories and resource-intensive foods aggravates these pressures.
    Current food production depends heavily on the use of inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, energy, land and water, and on unsustainable practices such as monocropping and heavy tilling. This has reduced the variety of landscapes and habitats, threatening or destroying the breeding, feeding and/or nesting of birds, mammals, insects and microbial organisms, and crowding out many native plant species.
    As a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, our food system is also driving climate change, which further degrades habitats and causes species to disperse to new locations. In turn, this brings new species into contact and competition with each other, and creates new opportunities for the emergence of infectious disease.
    Without reform of our food system, biodiversity loss will continue to accelerate. Further destruction of ecosystems and habitats will threaten our ability to sustain human populations. Reform will rely on the use of three principal levers:
        Firstly, global dietary patterns need to converge around diets based more on plants, owing to the disproportionate impact of animal farming on biodiversity, land use and the environment. Such a shift would also benefit the dietary health of populations around the world, and help reduce the risk of pandemics. Global food waste must be reduced significantly. Together, these measures would reduce pressure on resources including land, through reducing demand.
        Secondly, more land needs to be protected and set aside for nature. The protection of land from conversion or exploitation is the most effective way of preserving biodiversity, so we need to avoid converting land for agriculture. Restoring native ecosystems on spared agricultural land offers the opportunity to increase biodiversity.
        Thirdly, we need to farm in a more nature-friendly, biodiversity-supporting way, limiting the use of inputs and replacing monoculture with polyculture farming practices.
    
These three levers are in part interdependent. Most notably, the protection and setting aside of land for nature and the shift to nature-friendly farming both depend on dietary change, and will become increasingly difficult to achieve if continued growth in food demand exerts ever-growing pressure on land resources.
    The year ahead offers a potentially unique window of opportunity for food system redesign. A series of international summits and conferences will take place in 2021, during which the topic of food systems and biodiversity will be a common thread. Importantly, the UN secretary-general will convene the world’s first UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) in recognition of the need for a transformation of the food system to improve nutrition security, public health and environmental sustainability.
    In 2021, governments around the world are expected to unlock unprecedented levels of investment to support economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts to set in motion a ‘green recovery’ will bring questions of sustainability, equity and societal resilience to the fore, creating new opportunities for joined-up policymaking that affords equal priority to public and planetary health.
    In light of these opportunities, this paper recommends action on three fronts if efforts to establish a biodiversity-supporting food system are to be advanced in 2021:
        International decision-makers need to recognize the interdependence of supply-side and demand-side action. Dietary change and a reduction in food waste are critical to breaking the system lock-ins that have driven the intensification of agriculture and the continued conversion of native ecosystems to crop production and pasture.
        Stakeholders leading on the design and delivery of the UNFSS must ensure that it embeds a ‘food systems approach’ across other key international processes, including UN climate negotiations. The summit should aim to bring together the interdependent policy threads of environmental sustainability, inclusive prosperity, sustainable growth, and improved public health and well-being.
        International and national decision-makers need to strengthen the coherence between global agreements and national-level action. National dialogues are needed to translate global commitments into action on the ground. At the same time, national accounting frameworks will be key to building understanding of the value of biodiversity, and to supporting biodiversity protection. Global guidelines in policy areas such as responsible investment, dietary change and nature-based climate change mitigation solutions will be needed to guide national-level action plans that can collectively deliver transformative change to the global food system.

"UNCCD:1676";"Sustainable Land Management - Approaches and Practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina";"";"This publication introduces SLM and its principles and presents how good SLM practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina were documented, evaluated, selected and scaled through participatory land use planning processes. 

High demand for agricultural products and raw materials produced on land is under adverse social and economic conditions and a lack of adequate investment. 
This situation puts pressure on decision-makers to move towards prioritizing short-term land use purposes rather than long-term ones, which means preserving or increasing their potential fertility and thus sustainability in the production of food and biomass in general, for the needs of the population and future generations. Such a prevailing short-term approach creates a disparity between the market price and the real economic value of the land, which often leads to its further overexploitation and, consequently, degradation.

As the amount of arable land is fixed, it is quite clear that its quality or production capacity must be enhanced, improved and preserved for future generations; otherwise, the natural forest and aquatic ecosystem will have to be converted into agricultural land, which will have irreversible consequences on the state of biodiversity and impact on the acceleration of climate change. What future scenarios concerning this resource can be expected, given that we are faced with new and increasing challenges that have arisen because of changing land use?

Land use change is most often associated with rapid and unplanned urbanization, intensive exploitation of raw materials, particularly in mining and generally in the production of solid fuel energy or hydro-accumulation, deforestation, population growth, mass migrations, expansion of agriculture due to increasing demand for food and raw materials accompanied by the increase in standards of living and construction of massive infrastructure. 

The increasing incidence of extreme weather conditions and projected climate change are likely to exacerbate the extent and scope of land degradation and water scarcity in many parts of the world. ...different land management policies and strategies need to be implemented on a sustainable basis so that they are flexible and include many different instruments aimed at reversing land degradation trends towards preserving the land for the well-being of the planet Earth and for generations to come. Incidentally, degraded land, where possible, needs to be restored, rehabilitated, or converted into biologically and/or economically productive areas that will generate direct benefits to the land user and prevent further conversion of this ecosystem.

This concept is also envisaged under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) through Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), which Bosnia and Herzegovina has accepted as its approach voluntarily.

Agricultural land is a part of the land used for agricultural production. The efficient use and protection of agricultural land is one of the most important tasks of all levels of government. The Law on Agricultural Land in the Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Federation of BiH Official Gazette, no. 52/98) stipulates:

„Agricultural land as a natural resource and property of general interest to the Federation and Bosnia and Herzegovina, enjoys special protection, is used for agricultural production, and cannot be used for other purposes, except in the
cases and under the conditions laid down in this Law“.

Arable land includes plough-fields, gardens, orchards, vineyards and meadows. Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to statistics (BHAS, 2018), has a total of about 1,843,832 hectares of agricultural land, and an overview of areas under a
certain land use per capita (3.531.159 citizens according to the 2013 census)....

"UNCCD:100000012";"PowerPoint Presentation: Towards a better understanding of land and soil degradation in Europe";"";"We recognize the economic and social significance of good land management, including soil,
We stress that desertification, land degradation and drought are challenges of a global dimension and continue to pose serious challenges to the sustainable development of all countries,
We recognize the need for urgent action to reverse land degradation. In view of this, we will strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world in the context of sustainable development.
Measuring Land degradation is a challenge
①Declining land-productivity ≠ Land degradation e.g. less intensive agriculture may decrease yields in the short-term,but improve environmental quality in the long-term
②Increasing land-productivity ≠ Land improvement e.g. intensive agriculture may increase yields in the short-
term, but reduce environmental quality in the long-term
③Land degradation = Declining land-productivity degraded land will always perform worse than its unaffected counterpart
Conclusions
①Forests and semi natural vegetation account for 50% of all areas where land-productivity is increasing
②Agriculture accounts for 35% of the strongly declining area and 50% of areas exhibiting early- signs of decline - land under permanent crops is affected than other agricultural classes
③Less than 1% of EU arable land is coincident with declining land-productivity, and 0.2% of pastures, but over 10% of the most productive soils are affected –particularly the Western and Mediterranean regions
④Almost all Member States are affected by declining land-productivity to some degree
⑤Without an accepted indicator, we cannot yet confirm if the EU is Land Degradation Neutral or not";"Cherlet, Michael

"UNCCD:200000467";"Combining Earth Observations, Cloud Computing, and Expert Knowledge to Inform National Level Degradation Assessments in Support of the 2030 Development Agenda";"";"Monitoring progress towards the 2030 Development Agenda requires the combination of traditional and new data sources in innovative workflows to maximize the generation of relevant information. We present the results of a participatory and data-driven land degradation assessment process at a national scale, which includes use of earth observation (EO) data, cloud computing, and expert knowledge for Argentina. 

Six dierent primary productivity trend maps were produced from a time series of the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Dierence Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset (2000–2018), including the most widely used trajectory approach and five alternative methods, which include information on the timing and magnitude of the changes. To identify the land productivity trend map which best represented ground conditions, an online application was developed, allowing 190 experts to choose the most representative result for  their region of expertise nationwide. 

Additionally, the ability to detect decreases in land productivity of each method was assessed in 43,614 plots where deforestation had been recorded. The widely used trajectory indicator was the one selected by most experts as better reflecting changes in land condition. When comparing indicators’ performance to identify deforestation-driven reductions in productivity, the Step-Wise Approach Trend Index (SWATI), which integrates short- and long-term trends, was the one which performed the best. 

On average, decreases of land productivity indicate that 20% of the Argentine territory has experienced degradation processes between 2000 and 2018. The participatory data generation and verification workflow developed and tested here represents an innovative low cost, simple, and fast way to validate maps of vegetation trends and other EO-derived indicators, supporting the monitoring of progress towards land degradation neutrality by 2030.";"Teich, Ingrid

With a profound demographic shift in Africa from rural areas to the cities where half of all Africans will live by 2050, these gaps will become steadily more pronounced as governments and communities rise to the challenge of growing enough aff ordable nutritious food for all families to thrive on the continent. In some countries in the region, these gaps—allied as they are with high
poverty rates and large-scale unemployment—have become suffi ciently wide to undermine shared growth and social cohesion. Women are especially vulnerable. Th ey make up 70 percent of Africa’s farmers
and yet, for the most part, are locked out of land ownership by customary laws. Without a title to the land they farm, women are unable to raise the money needed to improve their small harvests or to raise living standards.

"UNCCD:400000118";"Land reform: Land settlement and cooperatives";"";" Although ancestral rights to land are a cornerstone of the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, few countries have been ready to undertake their recognition. Lack of political will together with obstacles such as lack of legal recognition of indigenous rights in national legal frameworks and tenure regimes, different forms of discrimination and inappropriate policies towards indigenous peoples are at the root of some of the limitations that are found with regard to the recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights. As a contribution to the particular interests of indigenous peoples, this issue of Land Reform, Land Settlement and Cooperatives addresses the main issues that are at the core of the recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights.

"UNCCD:400000119";"Land reform: Land settlement and cooperatives";"";"Almost all societies acknowledge the concept of state or public landownership in which property rights are vested in a public body on a national, regional or community level. State and public land tenure arrangements define rules for the distribution, use and protection of publicly vested lands. State lands may be used to deliver public services. Authorities or customary rulers may act as custodians of common property resources or of environmentally or culturally sensitive sites on behalf of society. Many forms of public tenure arrangements have been introduced. They commonly differ from private arrangements by limiting access, use and alienation of public lands. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of state lands and their proper management, public land and property assets are generally weakly managed. Considered as “free” and available, state lands are commonly encroached upon, overutilized and acquired for personal gain. Undefined tenure arrangements and poor recording of land rights contribute to the poor and ineffective management of public lands, providing fertile ground for corrupt practices. The situation is made more serious by weak governance, which is common in land administration institutions. There are no simple solutions for improvement. However, progress has been made by improving transparency, consistency, impartiality and equity in land administration institutions and by enhancing their technical competences and clarifying their management objectives, i.e. by improving the governance of state and public lands

While each has had a relatively short duration, all have been planned and implemented within a single conceptual framework with a much longer time horizon. This has allowed a difficult and complex issue to be progressively developed and nurtured within a realistic time scale, while building up a strong sense of national ownership of the process. The paper argues that FAO support has played a pivotal role in opening up debate to new ideas, at a time when thinking about land issues needed a radical stimulus. It was also instrumental in bringing non-agricultural government departments, national and international non-governmental organizations and academic specialists fully into the legislative and implementation programmes. The result of this combined effort is an innovative and progressive policy and legislative framework supported by a wide range of groups that often have conflicting interests when it comes to land access and use

Needs have changed and there are new dimensions to previous concerns. Gender issues have been integrated into FAO activities, and Land Reform, Land Settlement and Cooperatives has published articles on how the rights of rural women have or have not been taken into account in agrarian reform programmes. Likewise, there is now an ecological dimension to concerns about socio-economic viability, and the results of experiments carried out in many parts of the world have been widely published. It is therefore necessary to seek out new, more open and flexible ways to tackle the problem of equitable access to natural resources and, in particular, to land.

"UNCCD:133";"Healing the land: The story of land reclamation and soil conservation in Iceland";"";"Different processes of land degradation have been the outcome in many parts of the world, having severe impacts on ecosystems and the services they provide and on human livelihoods. Land degradation is one of the key challenges facing mankind in order to achieve sustainable development, but the quest for sustainability of land management has proved to be a major challenge to most countries. This book takes the case of Iceland. It tells the remarkable story of more than century combating land degradation.
There are many indications that soil erosion and desertification have decreased significantly over the past 20 years, and that land reclamation and the ability of the land to heal itself have outpaced land degradation. If this assessment is correct, it is the first time since Iceland’s settlement 1100 years ago, signalling that the recovery of land resources has now begun. The main reasons for this change are a warmer climate, diminishing grazing pressure at strategic areas, and revegetation activities representing a blend of practical knowledge, scientific endeavour and political support.";"Crofts, Roger";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2011-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land restoration";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"ISL";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/133";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/133_Healing-the-land.pdf";"";"";"";"208";"";""

Too often these degradation processes have been endured by the ecosystems for a long time, and, according to forecasts of climate change, are likely to worsen in the future. Ecological restoration combined with adaptive management can be effective tools in response to this environmental and socioeconomic problem. Reforestation and afforestation are restoration actions traditionally used to recover degraded lands for production and to alleviate on-going degradation processes. In some cases barren land has yielded magnificent forests, and in other cases the impacts are less clear. Despite the long-standing experience among scientists and land managers in reforesting degraded lands worldwide, in general, assessments of the results of land restoration projects are limited either in terms of data or breadth of perspective, and therefore little of real use can be drawn from this work. The lack of available scientific and technical information on restoration actions hampers the dissemination of technology within and among countries and regions, and the sharing and more comprehensive application of the best technology and approaches available.";"Bautista, Susana

"UNCCD:591";"LIFE and climate change adaptation";"";"Agricultural practices have adapted over millennia to regional and local variations in weather conditions. But as the effects of climate change become more noticeable, further adaptation becomes essential to ensure food security in Europe.

The need to improve cultivation techniques is perhaps more apparent in dry areas where the impact of climate change is already visible. As its name suggests, the Green Deserts project aimed to apply new planting techniques in desertified areas of Spain. By combining these techniques with an innovative water box technology (Twinboxx), it showed that even unpromising land could be made productive.

The boxes, which hold 25 litres of water, offer a novel way of planting trees that avoids the need for irrigation. A wick below the box ‘leaks’ the water slowly to the plant’s roots. “It basically restores the capillary function and forces the plant to grow deep roots anchored in the soil,” explains project manager Sven Kallen. Survival rates of round 80% were achieved without irrigation since the box captures rainwater and dew. “After one or two summers the box can be taken off for re-use in another plantation as the roots will have grown deep and wide into the soil where it will further develop thanks to the restored capillary action,” Mr Kallen adds.

 Restoring desertified areas is particularly effective for tackling the problem of climate change. The restored areas serve as “green barriers” to further erosion and allow more rainwater (especially from extreme rainstorms) to be absorbed. Trials with cash crops (trees for timber, cherries, almonds, pistachios etc.) showed the economic viability of the project’s method. Tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers also have been successfully cultivated in very arid areas in this way.";"Camarsa, Gabriella

"UNCCD:743";"Sustainable Land Management in Practice. Guidelines and Best Practices for Sub-Saharan Africa";"";"These guidelines have been developed based on FAO’s and WOCAT’s extensive experience. The book draws, in particular, on WOCAT’s network and its database of SLM knowledge - as well as on WOC AT’s first overview book entitled ‘Where the land is greener’. These guidelines were implemented in the framework of the TerrAfrica partnership, whose main objective is to mainstream and upscale SLM in SSA, through the leveraging and harmonising of multisectoral investments at the local, country, subregional and regional levels.
This book is aimed at giving a strong boost to the adoption of SLM on the African continent. It i s based on scientific and technical as well as practical and operational knowledge. It was written to provide clear guidance to countries, regional institutions and programmes, development partners and land users organizations that are ready and eager to change present investments towards a more sustainable direction.
The book presents 13 major groups of SLM technologies and approaches in a user-friendly manner, exemplified by 47 case studies from all over the region. It should be emphasized that, although comprehensive, these practices are not intended to be prescriptive or top-down, and in most cases can be improved and tailored to different situations. Users are therefore encouraged to adapt and modify them, based on specific conditions, integrating local knowledge and ingenuity.
Furthermore, the book addresses environmental issues that are the most pressing for SSA: thus not just combating land degradation, but also preserving ecosystem functions, ensuring food security, securing water resources within the land and confronting the climate change issues of adaptation and mitigation. Typical situations in SSA are addressed, and the potential for major contributions to improved livelihoods is emphasized.";"Liniger, Hanspeter

"UNCCD:761";"Land Degradation as a Security Threat Amplifier: The New Global Frontline";"";"Land degradation is a widespread crisis, destabilizing nations and communities on a global scale. To be
clear, food will be less plentiful (and thus more expensive) unless responsible land management and res-
toration is given priority on the international political agenda. The commitment to halt and reverse land
degradation will undoubtedly feature prominently in post-2015 development and climate agendas. If this
helps to bring about a transformative shift in land management policies and practices, it will certainly
contribute to achieving the global priorities of ensuring human security by eradicating poverty and hunger
and by reducing migration and conflict. While safeguarding human security poses numerous challenges,
to which we need to react, there are many proactive solutions—early interventions on the ground—that offer cost-effective opportunities for reducing risk and vulnerability at various scales.

The human security perspective allows us to focus on shared solutions to multiple challenges and to
better assess the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development in order
to leverage integrated and mutually reinforcing approaches that are context specific. In this book, the authors and editors have provided valuable insights into a number of issues related to protecting and restoring our land resources for the benefit of current and future generations. Using case studies from around the world, they have outlined the diverse strategies and multiple benefits of a holistic land-based approach to reducing some of the underlying drivers of human insecurity. They conclude that investing in these practical nature-based solutions, which transform lives and reduce vulnerability, would be cheaper and more effective in many cases than investing in walls, wars, and relief.";"Barbut, Monique

"UNCCD:794";"Making sense of research for sustainable land management";"";"Land is of multi-dimensional character. It is multi-scale, multi-functional, multi-sectorial, multi-actor based: it needs people from practice and research to interact as equal partners to make sense of research for sustainable land management. The kind of research needed to deal with this complexity and these challenges we term implementation-oriented research. With its many practical examples, this book explores alternatives to the often perceived ‘either – or’ choice between agricultural intensification on the one hand, and expansion of arable land on the other. There is a third route to satisfy human needs for food, fibre, and fodder. 

This is the strategy of sustainable intensification. Twelve regional projects with the participation of more than 600 scientists within the seven-year-long research programme gained experience in land management contexts as different as those in Angola, Botswana, Brazil, China, Germany, Madagascar, Namibia, the Philippines, Russia (Siberia), and Vietnam. Lessons were learned about knowledge management and science-practice interaction.

The book provides evidence of how practices of sustainable land management – existing as well as new – can be adapted to specific local and regional contexts. It shows how research can support decision makers and advisors from a variety of sectors - at national, regional, and local levels - in comprehending the complexity of sustainable land management. It assists them in identifying and developing suitable solutions for prevention or restoration of land degradation, improvement of yields, increasing resilience in production systems, and making water management more efficient. A special focus targets measures for climate change adaptation and mitigation.";"Liniger, Hanspeter

Approaches to measuring extent and impacts";"";"Land take, or the change from non-artificial to artificial land cover, reflects on-going and often conflicting claims on land. Some of the land that is 'taken' for urban development is covered with an impervious surface, which severely hampers ecosystem functioning and the related delivery of ecosystem services. 
However, when land is 'recycled', land that was developed in the past and has become available for redevelopment again is reused. Urban densification, or infilling, can also prevent the consumption of land that may be very valuable for food production or recreation. In this report, the processes of recycling and densification are jointly referred to as 'land recycling in its broad sense'. Land recycling can be considered a response to the on-going pressures we as a society apply to our land resources, particularly in the urban fringe.

The Economics and Finance of Restoring Land";"";"Almost one-quarter of the world’s land area has been degraded over the past 50 years because of soil erosion, salinization, peatland and wetland drainage, and forest degradation. The resulting damage, in terms of lost ecosystem goods and services, costs the world an estimated US$6.3 trillion a year. Almost a quarter of the world’s land area has been degraded over the past 50 years. 
This is the result of soil erosion, salinization, peatland and wetland drainage, and forest degradation. 
The scale of the resulting damage is staggering: It costs the world an estimated $6.3 trillion a year (8.3 percent of global GDP in 2016) in lost ecosystem service value, which includes agricultural products, clean air, fresh water, climate regulation, recreational opportunities, and fertile soils (Sutton et al. 2016). 

Land degradation also jeopardizes the livelihoods of half a billion mostly poor people who depend on forests and agricultural lands. Declining land productivity undermines sustainable development, threatens food and water security, and leads to involuntary human migration and even civil conflict. At the global scale, land degradation compromises the integrity of the biosphere. Biodiversity loss represents a reduction of the world’s genetic resources as well as an incalculable diminution in the richness of life on earth. Forests help to regulate the global hydrological cycle, and plant vegetation and soils are a major carbon sink helping to offset human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide. Restoring forests and other landscapes should be an urgent global priority. 
There has never been a more pressing moment to restore the world’s degraded landscapes. Around 2 billion hectares of land—twice the size of China—was once forested but is now degraded, with little economic or ecological value. Rarely, if ever, have humans wasted a valuable resource with such abandon.

"UNCCD:919";" 4 Returns from landscape restoration.  A systematic and practical approach to restore degraded landscapes.";"";"Why is it so important to restore degraded landscapes? It’s actually very simple. 
We rely on healthy ecosystems to provide us with our food, water, clean air, climate stability, social and economic wealth; even our happiness and well-being. We only have to look at history to see the devastating consequences of not valuing or understanding ecosystems: whole civilizations have vanished after overexploiting their natural resources.
Fortunately however, there are also civilizations who have learned to develop a symbiotic relationship with nature – and thrived – by restoring instead of destroying. Rapid global population growth in the last two centuries has caused the depletion of one quarter of the land surface on Earth as its natural resources have been used to support the unprecedented demand for sustaining human life and advances in technology. However, the scale and speed at which change has been inflicted on the environment since the 1950s is the most profound in the history of humankind; a phenomenon leading scientists call the Great Acceleration.
Many of the services nature provides humankind – so-called ecosystem services – are free of charge and therefore form no part of our current economy that is based on manufactured capital. This comes at the price of: the massive loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and degraded landscapes. As shown historically, human life depends on ecosystems services. As business and ecosystems are inextricably linked, landscape conservation and restoration should be key to our economy. Yet interventions to date focus only on impact reduction.

"UNCCD:968";"Test of Endurance: Addressing migration and security risks by means of landscape restoration in Africa";"";"For the African continent, the ability to manage trade-offs at a landscape scale has huge potential to influence the future of migration and conflict, as well as the future of land resources, food security and biodiversity. Integrated land management can act as an accelerator for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and can be considered an essential element of a sustainable strategy to address the root causes of irregular migration. A Marshall Plan for sub-Saharan Africa and the Sahel should therefore include the potential of landscape restoration approaches to achieve multiple wins, while taking into account its long-term effects and short- and medium-term risks.

This report aims to assess, by setting out a stakeholder mapping, to what extent landscape restoration initiatives (potentially) address migration and security objectives in Africa. The issue of land degradation and restoration is receiving increasing attention from policy makers with regard to addressing the root causes of migration. Landscape restoration initiatives in Africa have political momentum, with African political leaders endorsing restoration initiatives such as the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) and the Great Green Wall Initiative.

Africa is particularly vulnerable to land degradation, with desertification affecting around 45 percent of Africa’s land area. A large proportion of Africa’s land cover is composed of varying types of drylands. The issue of land degradation is even more pressing considering the expected doubling of the population in Africa between 2018 and 2050, rapid urbanisation, and the high dependency of over 80 percent of the population on local land for livelihoods (in sub-Saharan Africa). This, in turn, is likely to have an impact on involuntary migration, conflict, food insecurity and poverty. Even though the statistical and causal relationships between these problems are still the subject of academic debate, evidence is mounting that the relationships do exist.";"van Schaik, Louise

Sustainable land use is closely connected with many sustainable development objectives Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN).  It is estimated that two billion hectares of land is degraded worldwide, and we continue to degrade another 12 million hectares of productive land every year. 
According to the 2018 World Atlas of Desertification produced by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, 75% of the Earth’s land area is already degraded, and over 90% could become degraded by 2050.

Land degradation is not a stand-alone issue, but threatens the future sustainability of life on Earth, with severe impacts on food security, livelihoods, climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Sustainable land management (SLM) practices such as landscape restoration and agroforestry offer great opportunities to reduce and reverse land degradation, and produce significant environmental and social benefits.

LDN is defined by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) as: “A state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remains stable or increases""

The environmental benefits of that work are already well documented, particularly when it comes to the inextricablelinks with climate change and biodiversity.

Through the remarkable stories of people who decided to fight back rather than become another statistic tracking poverty, conflict or forced migration, it reveals the cost-effective results that can be achieved locally and scaled up globally when the right partners come together. 

Restoring and sustainably managing degraded land globally could save between USD 4.3 and USD 20.2 trillion annually through the provision of ecosystem services alone. Research consistently shows how well land recovers when the right management practices are introduced, as do the communities whose livelihoods depend on it. But to fully seize the opportunities offered by restoration, we need to build public awareness, support forward-looking policy, back innovation and scale up proven solutions.

"UNCCD:1226";"Land Restoration for Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals: An International Resource Panel Think Piece.";"";"Land restoration has tremendous potential to help the world limit climate change and achieve its aims for sustainable development. In its latest study, the International Resource Panel finds positive spin-offs to support all 17 Sustainable Development Goals agreed to by the world’s nations as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

While other reports have focused on a subset of the SDGs, this report has intentionally considered all of them, and has done so by inviting a large number of diverse authors to participate in the process.

Their observations and conclusions, while by no means comprehensive, paint a picture of opportunity and hope as investments in land restoration rapidly grow across the globe. A summary of their conclusions is that land restoration has co-benefits for all SDGs, indirectly, directly, or both. At the same time, the authors collectively acknowledge that the challenges of restoring land, and of realizing SDG co-benefits, are significant, as evidenced by the variable success of past initiatives.

The International Resource Panel’s GRO report provides a unique framework for focusing both local and global investments in the SDGs on those activities that promote “improved resource productivity and a relative decoupling of well-being [e.g. SDGs 1-7] from resource use”. The “Sustainability Scenario” (IRP 2019), used by the GROreport to support its conclusion that decoupling is possible, is based in part on assumptions about global shifts in population growth and consumption patterns.

But it also relies on the potential for significant increases in resourceuse efficiency (see https://www.resourcepanel.org/ glossary for definitions of “decoupling” and related terms).Matters relating to land are complex and varied, and can be viewed from an array of perspectives including: political, social, economic, productivity, legal, historical, identity, religious and spiritual. These perspectives relate to power, conquest, colonialism, alienation and patriarchy, and include ownership and communal systems, extraction and other user rights and stewardship. Some of the most influential writers, artists and philosophers have written about land over the millennia. 

As we approach the final decade before the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are to be achieved in 2030 a huge step-up is required on all fronts if the world is to achieve its targets and reverse the climate and species crises. Currently, about a quarter of the world’s land is degraded. Land restoration and rehabilitation together represent one of three primary strategies for achieving SDG 15 (Life on Land), and particularly for meeting the land degradation neutrality target under that goal (15.3). This International Resource Panel think piece highlights that both the process of land restoration and rehabilitation, and the restored land, have tremendous potential to help the world limit climate change and achieve its aims for sustainable development. 

The think piece provides diverse reflections for policymakers, academics and practitioners for the development of strategies to maximize the co-benefits of land restoration and rehabilitation for life on land by highlighting the risks, trade-offs and costs of land restoration and rehabilitation for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its associated goals. It strongly recommends a systemic analysis, before investment is made, to avoid unintended consequences. 

The think piece provides a clear strategy to maximize cross-cutting opportunities for land restoration or rehabilitation across multiple SDGs. The observations and conclusions provided by the 37 authors, while by no means exhaustive, provide hope and aspirations for investments in land restoration and rehabilitation across the globe.

ABOUT: An IRP think piece is a technical or policy paper based on IRP scientific studies and assessments and other relevant literature.

In this report an overview of the current situation for each of the priority areas of the UN Support Plan is presented to demonstrate that the full implementation of the plan could utilize an existing momentum of development not seen in decades in the Sahel.

The Sahel is the youngest region in the world with close to 65% of the population below the age of 25. It further faces simultaneous challenges of extreme poverty, the dire effects of climate change, frequent food crises, rapid population growth, fragile governance, and terrorist- linked security threats. The world-famous trade and migration routes across the Sahel and the Sahara are being taken over by trans-national organized criminal groups and large-scale traffickers. A small proportion of the criminal or illegal proceeds is instead used to feed extremism and exacerbate instability. Conflict over access to land, water and other resources are significant.

Despite these challenges, the Sahel holds multiple opportunities. Initiatives from their own governments and people, supported by development agencies and foreign investments are also at last making a difference that we have not seen in almost 70 years. This report shows advances and real progress in several key areas.

Desertification is being reversed with over 32 million ha of land reclaimed in dry countries of West and Eastern Africa. This is bringing in jobs, cash incomes, improving food security and empowering women. It helps bring in stronger community engagement and reduce conflicts between farmers and pastoralists.

The Sahel Alliance committed in 2018 to implement over 500 projects worth over EUR 6 billion in the G5 countries between 2018 and 2022, especially in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
Below are some of the the priority objectives of the UN Support Plan among which:

UN Support Plan Priority Four: Building resilience to climate change, decrease natural resource scarcity, malnutrition and food insecurity.
1. Facilitate at least 20 million farmers’ access to affordable drought-resistant seeds, fertilizers (organic/inorganic) and or irrigation facilities (including solar-powered facilities) by 2022 in the region (SDG targets 2.4).
2. Combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and support national and regional institutions to reclaim at least 10 percent of degraded land in 500 communities by 2022 (SDG targets 15.3).
3. Increase transhumance or cattle tracks by at least 30,000 to support pastoralism and reduce pastoralists-farmers kilometers by 2022 (SDGs targets 2.3; 16.1).

"UNCCD:1446";"Peatland mapping and monitoring: Recommendations and technical overview";"";"Peatlands cover only 3 percent of the world's surface yet contain as much carbon as all of its vegetation, dramatically underscoring their pivotal role in global climate regulation. Their degradation, by drainage or fire or other forces, triggers their conversion from slow carbon sinks into fast sources capable of releasing carbon stored over millennia in a few decades.
To avoid their degradation and effectively plan their restoration, peatlands should be urgently mapped and monitored.

To help member states on this complex task, FAO today launched Peatland mapping and monitoring, a practical publication full of accessible technical information about the world's peatlands and recommendations on how to manage these special ecosystems.

The publication is the joint work of 35 expert authors from 14 countries, and highlights experiences from tropical peatland countries such as Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, and the temperate regions.

""Mapping peatlands to know their location, extent and greenhouse gas emissions potential, can help countries to plan and better manage their land, water and biodiversity, mitigating climate change and adapting to it more effectively,"" says Maria Nuutinen, FAO's lead peatlands expert with the Forestry Department and co-author of the publication.

Accurate mapping of peatlands is a prerequisite to effectively monitoring changes in peatland condition. For countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fire risk, monitoring peatlands' condition, especially their water level becomes key. The task requires a mix of satellite and ground-based exercises. To facilitate countries' access to high-quality imagery, FAO has developed a state-of-the-art peatland restoration monitoring module.

Accessible in SEPAL, part of FAO's geospatial toolkit, the module was successfully implemented for the first time in Indonesia by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency and Ministry of Environment and Forestry. 

The peatland monitoring module provides timely information about soil moisture trends to help detect drainage and monitor restoration efforts. Soil moisture maps can be updated every 2 weeks using Sentinel-1 imagery from the European Space Agency.

""The open-source peatland monitoring module on the SEPAL platform will be further developed to serve the needs of the Congo Basin, helping to detect and address potential changes and avoid fires,"" adds Julian Fox, National Forest Monitoring Team Leader at FAO.

Among the government's initiatives are the ""One Map"" policy and the creation of the Peatland Ecosystem Protection and Management Plan to guide peatland protection and monitoring.. 

The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021–2030 is likely to use many approaches currently developed being for FLR, including peatland restoration monitoring and land degradation neutrality (LDN), a new concept introduced by the UNCCD in 2015.The UNCCD is a legally binding international agreement linking the environment and development to sustainable land management. The Convention specifically focuses on arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones (drylands). 

The UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework is a comprehensive global commitment to achieve LDN to avoid new degradation as well as restore the productivity of large areas of degraded land, including all land types while improving livelihoods.

A set of countries are restoring previously drained peatlands as part of their voluntary commitment to achieving LDN. 

The LDN reporting indicators were still to be finalized at the time of writing, but a draft version contains the indicators and associated GHG emission metrics. The following are related to peatlands: land cover (assessed as land cover change), and carbon stocks (assessed as soil organic carbon, SOC), as in Parties’ regular reporting to the UNCCD. In addition, Parties are requested to identify ongoing land degradation, including gullying and coastal inundation, for example, and the drivers of land degradation, including unsustainable land use practices, such as overgrazing – both also relevant to peatlands (GEF, 2019).";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land restoration";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1446";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1446_fao_peatlands_CA8200EN.pdf";"";"";"";"100";"";""
"UNCCD:1474";"Guidelines for Land Degradation Neutrality. A report prepared for the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel of the Global Environment Facility";"";"These guidelines support GEF project developers in formulating projects that contribute to the LDN ambitions of countries and in ensuring that other projects not directly targeting LDN are compatible with LDN objectives and approaches. The guidelines complement and expand the Checklist for Land Degradation Neutrality Transformative Projects and Programmes.They are intended to be applied during project development and at the problem definition and intervention design stages; they are also relevant to monitoring the achievement of LDN goals. 

LDN will only be achieved through concerted and coordinated efforts to integrate LDN objectives with land-use planning and land management, underpinned by sound understanding of the human-environment system and effective governance mechanisms. Therefore, these guidelines focus particularly on laying the foundation to achieve LDN by establishing enabling policies and applying integrated land-use planning, informed by preparatory assessments, as described in the Scientific Conceptual Framework for LDN (LDN-SCF).
The document was prepared in close consultation to ensure continuity with the LDN Conceptual Framework as well as guidance developed by the GM. This publication will contribute to our efforts to seed the “innovation ecosystem” building up around the LDN concept. The timing is also important, considering that land use change is the primary indirect driver behind emerging infectious diseases, and the no-net loss approach of LDN is a holistic policy response to optimizing land use decisions that can keep land in balance, in in so doing, food, energy and nature in balance. 

 In 2015 the UNCCD introduced the new concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), which was later adopted as a target of Goal 15 of the SDGs, Life on Land: 120 countries have committed to pursue voluntary LDN targets.
The objectives of LDN are to: maintain or improve the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services; maintain or improve productivity, in order to enhance food security; increase resilience of the land and populations dependent on the land; seek synergies with other social, economic and environmental objectives; and reinforce responsible and inclusive governance of land.

The fundamental aim of LDN is to preserve the land resource base, by ensuring no net loss of healthy and productive land, at national level. This goal is to be achieved through a combination of measures that avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation. Achieving LDN requires estimating the likely cumulative impacts of land use and land management decisions, and counterbalancing anticipated losses through strategically-planned rehabilitation or restoration of degraded land, within the same land type.
These guidelines offer practical help to those developing projects which contribute to Land Degradation Neutrality.

Each of the five modules presents key concepts, principles, and practical steps for implementation.

organizations, and the private sector to address global environmental issues. http://www.thegef.org";"Cowie, Annette L.";"Global Environment Facility";"Global Environment Facility";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land policies;land restoration;land use;land use planning";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1474";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1474_LDN_Technical_Report_web_version.pdf";"";"";"";"60";"";""
"UNCCD:1500";"Restoration in Action Against Desertification. A manual for large-scale restoration to support rural communities’ resilience in Africa's Great Green Wall.";"";"This publication supports processes related to rural communities’ resilience in implementing land restoration of the Great Green Wall Programme on the ground. It serves a dual purpose of consolidating biophysical operations and socio-economic assessments, and is mainly built on five-year interventions and practical experiences gathered through Action Against Desertification.

The first part of the publication is a practical manual expressly created for stakeholders, partners, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations. Its purpose is to guide the implementation of restoration operations at scale on the ground, as well as to provide detailed practical instructions based on the successful results obtained by Action Against Desertification. The manual describes how to implement an innovative approach to the large-scale restoration of degraded land for small-scale farming. This innovative approach consists of combining enrichment planting of native woody and fodder grass species and the preparation of large-scale land for rainwater harvesting and soil permeability.

The second part of the manual introduces a methodology for socio-economic assessments. This easy to-to-use approach is based on household surveys and can be used by socio-economic experts to monitor, evaluate and assess the socio-economic impacts of the large-scale restoration interventions. Household surveys are not only used for impact assessment but can potentially serve to collect useful data needed to plan a restoration intervention. Quantitative information is collected through carefully chosen standardized questions to households as samples.";"Sacande, M.

"UNCCD:1516";"Protecting 30% of the planet for nature: costs, benefits and economic implications.";"";"You cannot put a price tag on nature — but the economic numbers point to its protection,” said Anthony Waldron, the lead author of the report and researcher focused on conservation finance, global species loss and sustainable agriculture.

The report’s authors find that obtaining the substantial benefits of protecting 30% of the planet’s land and ocean, requires an average annual investment of roughly $140 billion by 2030. The world currently invests just over $24 billion per year in protected areas.
“This investment pales in comparison to the economic benefits that additional protected areas would deliver and to the far larger financial support currently given to other sectors,” said Enric Sala, co-author of this report, explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society and the author of the forthcoming book The Nature of Nature: Why We Need the Wild (August 2020).
“Investing to protect nature would represent less than one-third of the amount that governments spend on subsidies to activities that destroy nature. It would represent 0.16% of global GDP and require less investment than the world spends on video games every year.”
The Campaign for Nature (CFN), which commissioned this report, is working with a growing coalition of over 100 conservation organizations, and scientists around the world in support of the 30%+ target, and increased financial support for conservation. CFN is also working with Indigenous leaders to ensure full respect for Indigenous rights and free, prior, and informed consent. CFN recommends that funding comes from all sources, including official development assistance, governments’ domestic budgets, climate financing directed to nature-based solutions, philanthropies, corporations, and new sources of revenue or savings through regulatory and subsidy changes. As 70-90% of the cost would be focused on low and middle income countries because of the location of the world’s most threatened biodiversity, these countries will require financial assistance from multiple sources.

Did you know?

Today only 15 percent of land and 7 percent of our ocean are protected. We’re on track to reach a global goal of protecting 17 percent of the land and 10 percent of the ocean by the end of 2020, but world leaders need to dramatically boost ambition — both on spatial targets and the inclusion of Indigenous peoples — in order to protect the natural world. In order to achieve the transformative change necessary to safeguard our future and that of countless species, we need solutions that make use of the best information. The Campaign for Nature is underpinned by the latest work of leading scientific experts from around the world.

This is just a small sample of the science behind our goal to achieve protection for 30% of the planet by 2030. ( see major publications)
The Science Behind 30%. Why 30 % ?
The Path to Conserving 30 Percent of the Planet by 2030. PERSPECTIVES FROM INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL CONSERVATION LEADERS 


The World Economic Forum (WEF) and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) have both identified biodiversity loss as one of the main threats to global economic prosperity1,2. In particular, this high-level warning specifies that any further loss of natural habitats and biodiversity will cause extensive and costly flooding, climate change, disease emergence and ill health, clean water shortages, loss of crop pollination, decline in productivity, and numerous other risks1,2. All of these negative outcomes are the consequence of degrading the natural infrastructure that supports human economic activity and wellbeing. One of the main policy instruments to slow the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of nature is the creation of protected or conservation areas (simple examples being a Nature Reserve or Marine Reserve)3–6. Currently, ~16% of the land and 7.4% of the ocean is in areas designated or proposed for protection (although only 2.5% of the ocean is in highly/fully protected areas)7,8. This level of protection is widely acknowledged as being inadequate to achieve biodiversity protection goals7,9–12. One of the headline proposals for the 15th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the CBD, and Action Target 2 of the draft post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework13, is to increase the area covered by protected areas (PAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) to 30% of the planet by 2030, including both land and water protection.

Land purchase costs are difficult to estimate because there is no global database of land prices and indeed, many PAs have been established on land for which purchase is inappropriate e.g. government-owned land or land with communal ownership by an IPLC group. A common proxy for agricultural land price is the net farm income divided by the capitalization rate of agricultural land (where income has to be modelled based on the expected production and costs of not-yet-converted land)105. We calculated this proxy for all the new land in each scenario, noting that this will give an overestimate, since it ignores both yield gaps106,107 and cost savings on government or indigenous lands. Conversely, the capitalization rates, taken from European farms105, are likely to also overestimate costs in non-EU countries. Thus, CAPEX is underestimated but purchase cost is overestimated, partially cancelling out much of their respective errors in the calculation of establishment cost. The cost of a large land purchase for a long-term protected area program would typically be subject to some form of loan or national debt arrangement, rather than coming out of the first year’s budget in a single payment. We therefore annualised the land purchase cost by amortising it over 20 years.

We collated current budget allocations to national protected area networks using a similar protocol to the one used for collating budget needs. We were able to source primary estimates for 124 countries. The data-deficient countries and territories were mostly small offshore island territories, microstates, small island states and lower-income countries, all of which are unlikely to have budgets exceeding a few million dollars. The main exceptions were Venezuela (although its recent PA budget is not likely to be large), Portugal, Japan, Iran, Finland and Switzerland. An additional important consideration was that much of the European Union budget information has not been updated for ten years, during which time the protected area estate (and so presumably the budget) has increased

"UNCCD:1524";"Guidance for using the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions: a user-friendly framework for the verification, design and scaling up of Nature-based Solutions: first edition";"";"IUCN  unveiled a Global Standard providing the first-ever set of benchmarks for nature-based solutions to global challenges. The new IUCN Global Standard will help governments, business and civil society ensure the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and maximise their potential to help address climate change, biodiversity loss and other societal challenges on a global scale. The world is looking for durable and effective options to tackle global challenges such as climate change, food and water security, and now, economic recovery from the global pandemic. To this end, the new IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions is ideally placed to harness and accelerate the sustainable use of nature,” said IUCN’s Global Director for the Nature-based Solutions Group Stewart Maginnis. “For nature-based solutions to fulfil their potential, we must ensure that the actions put in place today bring about the desired benefits for society and biodiversity. This Global Standard offers a rigorous, consistent and accountable framework that will help avoid any misuse and take nature-based solutions from the local to global scale.”

The concept of nature-based solutions (NbS) – actions addressing key societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems, benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being – is increasingly being applied around the world. More than 130 countries have already included NbS actions – such as reforestation, green infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and aquaculture, or coastal protection – in their national climate plans under the Paris Agreement.

However, not all actions labelled as “nature-based solutions” provide the anticipated benefits to both society and biodiversity, and the global potential of NbS is far from being fully realised.

“Until now, there has been neither consensus nor coherent guidance on how to design and implement nature-based solution interventions that are capable of consistent delivery of benefits for people and nature,” said Angela Andrade, Chair of the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management, which helped lead the development of the Global Standard. “The contribution of the Commission, in addition to input from over 800 experts and practitioners from 100 countries, has been to guide the development of the IUCN Global Standard, ensuring that it is scientifically robust and applicable across a wide range of regions and scenarios.”

The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions has eight criteria and associated indicators that allow the user to assess the aptness, scale, economic, environmental and social viability of an intervention; consider its possible trade-offs; ensure transparency and adaptive project management; and explore possible linkages to international targets and commitments. It consists of a user guide and self-assessment tool, which identifies areas for improving and learning.";"";"International Union for Conservation of Nature";"International Union for Conservation of Nature";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agricultural land management;biodiversity;land degradation;land restoration";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1524";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1523_2020-020-En.pdf";"";"";"";"78";"";""
"UNCCD:1525";"Caring for soil is caring for life. Ensure 75% of soils are healthy by 2030 for healthy food, people, nature and climate : interim report of the mission board for soil health and food";"";"Life on Earth depends on healthy soils. The soil under our feet is a living system – home to many fascinating plants and animals, whose invisible interactions ensure our well-being and that of the planet. Soils provide us with nutritious food and other products as well as with clean water and flourishing habitats for biodiversity. At the same time, soils can help slow the onset of climate change and make us more resilient to extreme climate events such as droughts and floods. 

Soils preserve our cultural heritage and are a key part of the landscapes that we all cherish. Simply put, healthy living soils keep us, and the world around us, alive.
However, we tend to take these benefits for granted and as a result have neglected the health of our soils. The increasing demand for land for urban development and infrastructures is consuming our most fertile soils. At the same time, inappropriate or unsustainable use of soil and how we deal with our waste is affecting soil health, which in turn, disrupts the capacity of soils to carry out the vital services that they perform. Climate change is putting further pressure on soil health.
Why do we need to act now? Soils are fragile and they can take thousands of years to form but can be destroyed in hours! This means that we need to take care of soils now so that they can be regenerated and safeguarded for future generations.

Soil degradation is largely driven by how we live. Left unchecked, it will aggravate many challenges facing the European Union. It is no surprise that soil condition is at the heart of the new Green Deal for Europe and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, both of which aim to reduce biodiversity loss and pollution, reverse climate change while striving for a healthy environment and sustainable land use. The Mission will also have a major role in responding to risks from the coronavirus and other emerging infectious diseases. Some of the microbes which live in the soil are one of our most promising sources of new therapeutic drugs.

The mission “Caring for Soils is Caring for Life” will raise society’s awareness of soils and put Europe on a path towards sustainable land and soil management. The Mission will be a joint endeavour, bringing in people from all walks of life, be they farmers, scientists, business communities, politicians or citizens including the consumers, we all are.
Together, all of us will help to design and apply solutions to achieve the main goal of the Mission which is: By 2030, at least 75% of all soils in each EU Member State are healthy and are able to provide essential services that we depend on. Mission activities will combine research and innovation, training and advice as well as demonstration of good practices for soil management using “Lighthouses” and “Living labs”.

In addition, the Mission will develop improved ways for monitoring the status of soils, mobilise investments, encourage changes in policies and behaviour and ensure we do not export our soil degradation problems to other countries around the word.
Through actions that restore degraded land, empower land managers to sustainably use the soil and create the conditions to reward soil health, the Mission will have wide-reaching impacts on food, people, planet and the climate.
While previous Missions brought us to the moon, Caring for Soils is a Mission that will keep us safely on Earth with healthy soils!";"";"European Commission";"European Commission";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agricultural land management;desertification;land degradation;land degradation;land restoration;land use;migration;sustainable land management;sustainable land management;urban land";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Urban Tenure";"150";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1525";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1525_soil_health_eu_en.pdf";"";"";"";"56";"";""
"UNCCD:1545";"Biodiversity and the Great Green Wall : Managing nature for sustainable development in the Sahel";"";"The Great Green Wall is one of the main vehicles for delivering the Sustainable Development Goals and the Rio conventions in the Sahel. Biodiversity is the foundation of the Great Green Wall in many ways, determining soil productivity and water cycles and providing the foundation for risk management and resilient ecosystems. The Great Green Wall can make a major contribution to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is helping to re-focus efforts to combat desertification, to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality, and to improve food and water security in one of the most vulnerable places on earth. In doing so countries will contribute to both climate change mitigation and adaptation and to the restoration and protection of biodiversity.
However the Sahel faces some of the greatest environmental threats in the world, with a potential doubling of the both rural population and of the number of agriculture-dependent people living below the poverty line by 2030. Agricultural productivity in the Sahel is increasing, but not fast enough to keep pace with population growth. As countries invest more in dryland areas, greater threats to biodiversity are anticipated and the region is projected to be more affected by habitat destruction in the coming century than almost anywhere else on earth.

Biodiversity and the Great Green Wall explores the dependence of humanity on nature and the importance of biodiversity for wellbeing and sustainable development in the Sahel. The report is written to raise awareness of the critical role for biodiversity in achieving the goals of the Great Green Wall. It presents new evidence of the links between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human welfare, and demonstrates the importance of biodiversity for sustainable agriculture, providing arguments for the connection between the agricultural and environmental sectors.

"UNCCD:1553";"Regreening Africa: Consolidated Baseline Survey Report";"";"The United Nations General Assembly declared 2021 to 2030 as the decade of ‘ecosystem restoration’, signalling a global consensus on the urgency to restore degraded lands. Restoring degraded lands is critical to regain lost ecological functionality that underpins life-sustaining ecosystem services, such as the provision of food, fresh water, and fibre, and the regulation of climate, natural disasters, and pests. Indeed, restoration is fundamental for meeting the triple goals of tackling the climate crisis, reversing biodiversity loss, and improving human wellbeing.

Regreening Africa (2017 to 2022) is part of a larger global and regional effort to reverse and halt land degradation, which is being implemented in eight African countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Somalia. It is funded by the European Union and implemented by World Agroforestry (ICRAF), in partnership with five international non-governmental organizations (NGOs): World Vision, Oxfam, Care International, Catholic Relief Services, and Sahel Eco. 
It seeks to (a) directly reverse land degradation among 500,000 households across one million hectares of agricultural land in the eight sub-Saharan African countries; and (b) catalyze a much larger scaling effort to restore tens of millions of hectares of degraded land across the continent.
Purpose
This report presents findings from Regreening Africa’s baseline survey. The purpose for undertaking the baseline survey was threefold:
1.To generate baseline data required to later assess the programme’s local-level socio-economic and biophysical impacts, as well as the extent of household and community-level engagement in land restoration.
2.To identify critical factors in the policy and institutional environment (including those relevant to targeted tree-based value chains) that need to be addressed to unlock the scaling-up of cost-effective and impactful land restoration practices.
3.To generate evidence to inform the design and scaling up of land restoration efforts.

Reversing, or at least reducing, the challenges that threaten our life on this small planet has never been more important. Headlines in news media remind us of this every day, in addition to numerous scientific reports and journals. One of the biggest of these challenges is environmental degradation in all its manifold ways.
If we can find ways to successfully and sustainably reverse the effects of land degradation in Africa, we would be reducing the most important existential threat to people on the fastest growing continent in the world. Restoration makes eminent economic sense, as the Bonn Challenge has reminded us – the net benefits of restoring 350 million hectares by 2030 would exceed USD 170 billion. The challenge is to get this done in a way so as to satisfy multiple goals simultaneously because otherwise, as history shows us, early successes lead to failures as soon as funding spigots are turned off. And funds for restoration remain scarce.

Making the invested Euro stretch farther and with multiple benefits, while restoring – or ‘regreening’ – one million hectares of farm and pastureland across eight sub-Saharan African countries is the challenge set by the European Union to the Regreening Africa partnership. It’s a partnership of organizations that approach development from three different perspectives – policy, implementation and research. This project is about catalyzing meaningful, transformative change by moving people to ‘regreen’ or restore their landscapes so that they benefit now and their children continue to reap benefits in the future. It’s a unique attempt to use processes of structured learning, underpinned by scientific research, to inform an adaptive, iterative system of delivering better development outcomes.
In this project the research partner, World Agroforestry (ICRAF), also plays the lead role in programme implementation in partnership with five international non-governmental organizations (NGOs): World Vision, Oxfam, Care International, Catholic Relief Services, and Sahel Eco. The countries where this bold and innovative effort is taking place, thanks to the support of the governments concerned, are Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Somalia.

The report presented here takes to heart the adage, ‘you cannot manage what you cannot measure’, because it stipulates the need to measure holistically so as to manage holistically. The result is unique, innovative, and informative: a rounded picture of how things stand at the starting point of the project, as can be expected from any baseline study. But it goes further, because it is also an expression of soaring ambition – to deliver on multiple, meaningful objectives simultaneously. In this it is unique.

The report draws on recent advances in geospatial and agroecological sciences, the world’s best repository of knowledge on the keystone role of trees in agricultural systems, as well as fields such as behavioural economics and social sciences. From remote sensing, through smartphone-based apps, to ‘boots-on-the-ground’ truth-seeking, this report represents our best understanding of how to establish a launch pad for restoring landscapes by mobilizing people – ‘moving’ their social capital – into a regreening movement that works to better their livelihoods and restore their ecosystems. The report would be worth studying just for its articulate and precise explanation of regreening, and to see how far we have to go to restore these landscapes. But it offers much more: a glimpse of what could be a changed world for people in these landscapes when the project completes its work programme in 2022, and the bold vision of the European Union in establishing this project pays off.";"Hughes, K.

"UNCCD:1554";"Living Planet Report 2020 - Bending the curve of biodiversity loss.";"";"The Living Planet Report 2020 shows that there is an opportunity to heal our relationship with nature and mitigate risks of future pandemics but this better future starts with the decisions that governments, companies and people around the world take today. World leaders must take urgent action to protect and restore nature as the foundation for a healthy society and a thriving economy. 

Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in millions of years. The way we produce and consume food and energy, and the blatant disregard for the environment entrenched in ourcurrent economic model, has pushed the natural world to its limits.
COVID-19 is a clear manifestation of our broken relationship with nature. It has highlighted the deep interconnection between nature, human health and well-being, and how unprecedented biodiversity loss threatens the health of both people and the planet.

It is time we answer nature’s SOS. Not just to secure the future of tigers, rhinos, whales, bees, trees and all the amazing diversity of life we love and have the moral duty to coexist with, but because ignoring it also puts the health, well-being and prosperity, indeed the future, of nearly 8 billion people at stake. 

Agriculture is a significant driver of climate change, and climate change, in turn, adds further stress to land systems, worsening existing risks – for example of land degradation and biodiversity loss . Mitigating the negative impacts of agriculture on nature and biodiversity is therefore more important than ever.

Indeed, one-third of the terrestrial land surface is now used for cropping or animal husbandry, while of the total amount of water that people withdraw from available freshwater resources, 75% is used for crops or livestock.

Reducing food loss and waste represents a critical opportunity to relieve environmental pressure on our planet. An estimated one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally – this amounts to about 1.3 billion tonnes every year . This means that around one-quarter of the calories the world produces are never eaten: they’re spoiled or spilled in supply chains, or are wasted by retailers, restaurants and consumers. In a multiplier effect, when food loss and waste occurs along the supply chain, all the land, water, energy, seeds, fertiliser, labour, capital and other resources that went into its production also go to waste.

Food loss and waste also contributes to climate change. It is responsible for at least 6% of total global greenhouse gas
emissions , three times more than the global emissions from aviation .  Almost a quarter - 24% - of all emissions from the food sector comes from food that is lost in supply chains or wasted by consumers . At the same time, the potential of agricultural systems to provide habitats, and vegetation corridors for species to move between these habitats, enhancing rather than eroding ecosystem services and landscape resilience, has started to become more recognised . 

Some agricultural systems and specific components within them – from riparian corridors, hedges, woodland patches and clearings in forests, to waterways, ponds or other biodiversity-friendly features of the production environment – can provide habitat for specific species.

The global Living Planet Index continues to decline. It shows an average 68% decrease in population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish between 1970 and 2016. A 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical subregions of the Americas is the largest fall observed in any part of the world.

Why does this matter?
It matters because biodiversity is fundamental to human life on Earth, and the evidence is unequivocal – it is being destroyed by us at a rate unprecedented in history. Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increasingly destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands, wetlands and other important ecosystems, threatening human well-being. Seventy-five per cent of the Earth’s ice-free land surface has already been significantly altered, most of the oceans are polluted, and more than 85% of the area of wetlands has been lost. Species population trends are important because they are a measure of overall ecosystem health. Measuring biodiversity, the variety of all living things, is complex, and there is no single measure that can capture all of the changes in this web of life.

Nevertheless, the vast majority of indicators show net declines over recent decades. That’s because in the last 50 years our world has been transformed by an explosion in global trade, consumption and human population growth, as well as an enormous move towards urbanisation. Until 1970, humanity’s Ecological Footprint was smaller than the Earth’s rate of regeneration. 

To feed and fuel our 21st century lifestyles, we are overusing the Earth’s biocapacity by at least 56%.

These underlying trends are driving the unrelenting destruction of nature, with only a handful of countries retaining most of the last remaining wilderness areas. Our natural world is transforming more rapidly than ever before, and climate change is further accelerating the change.";"Almond, R.E.A.

This Outlook draws on the lessons learned during the first two decades of this century to clarify the transitions needed if we are to realize the vision agreed by world governments for 2050, ‘Living in Harmony with Nature’.

Each of the conditions necessary to achieve the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity requires a significant shift away from ‘business as usual’ across a broad range of human activities. The shape and nature of such transformative change can already be identified through a series of transitions under way to a limited extent in key areas. This Outlook examines the promise, progress and prospects for interdependent transitions on the following issues, that collectively can move our societies into a more sustainable co-existence with nature: 
Land and Forests
Freshwater
Fisheries and Oceans
Sustainable Agriculture
Food Systems
Cities and Infrastructure
Climate Action
One Health

By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combatting desertification.
Summary of target achievement
Progress towards the target of restoring 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems by 2020 is limited. Nevertheless, ambitious restoration programmes are under way or proposed in many regions, with the potential to deliver significant gains in ecosystem resilience and preservation of carbon stocks. The target has not been achieved (medium confidence).1";"";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agricultural land management;biodiversity;land restoration";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1563";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1563_gbo-5-en.pdf";"";"";"";"212";"";""
"UNCCD:1574";"Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2020";"";"The 2020 Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report provides an assessment of where African countries stand with respect to the SDGs and their progress toward the goals, with the additional lens of “leave no one behind.” The report also includes a preliminary analysis of the impact of COVID‑19 on the SDGs in Africa.

The interactive dashboard provides a visual representation of countries’ performance by SDGs to identify priorities for action. The data displayed in this dashboard is sourced from the 2020 Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report. The report was prepared by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa.
The Sustainable Development Report (formerly the SDG Index & Dashboards) is the first worldwide study to assess where each country stands with regard to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Unlike its predecessor the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs set standards not only for emerging and developing countries, but also for the industrialized nations. Governments and civil society alike can utilize the Sustainable Development Report to identify priorities for action, understand key implementation challenges, track progress, ensure accountability, and identify gaps that must be closed in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

The 2020 Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report provides an assessment of where African countries stand with respect to the SDGs and their progress toward the goals, with the additional lens of “leave no one behind.” The report also includes a preliminary analysis of the impact of COVID‑19 on the SDGs in Africa. The global pandemic is a humanitarian and economic crisis with serious immediate and also potentially long-term impacts, particularly on the social and economic goals. An additional 60 million Africans could be pushed into poverty and food insecurity is expected to nearly double. An estimated 110 million African children and youth are out of school, fragile health care systems are being tested, and women are at risk of being left out even more. Slow economic activity and lockdowns will increase unemployment and debt, while decreasing remittances, development assistance and domestic revenue are added risks to financing for development and SDGs. 

To rebuild, all countries should adopt the framework of sustainability. African governments are relatively well positioned to do so, as our updated implementation survey reveals. African governments have made significant efforts to endorse the SDGs and incorporate them into national strategies and development plans. The large majority of countries have identified government units to coordinate the implementation and have prioritized specific targets and indicators. Communication and information-sharing for stakeholder engagement is insufficient, but it has improved since the previous survey. All 34 country experts who validated results reported that lack of funding and resources is one of the most important challenges both in terms of SDG implementation and monitoring.

The analysis in terms of the current status and trends toward achieving the SDGs is comprehensive and comparable at the continental and subregional levels. Some key findings include: • Overall, North Africa is the best-performing region on average, while Central Africa is the worst-performing. Tunisia has replaced Mauritius as the top-ranking country.• Serious challenges exist and the majority of countries are currently performing very poorly. As in last year’s report, no country scored green for 13 of the 17 goals. 

The new Leave No One Behind (LNOB) Index and Dashboard results show that all African countries are currently struggling to tackle all kinds of inequalities. • The goals facing the greatest challenges are SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG 9 (infrastructure), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). The goals where the continent is performing better are SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production).• Across all countries and goals, the most frequently-observed trends are stagnation and moderate improvement, which is a positive development as compared to the 2019 analysis which was overwhelmingly stagnant. The only goal for which the majority of African countries are on track is SDG 13 on Climate Action.

This short summary report includes highlights from the full report, including part of the chapter on the impact of COVID-19, the results of the 2020 Africa SDG Index and Dashboards, and the new “leave no one behind” Index and Dashboards.

"UNCCD:1575";"The Great Green Wall Initiative: 2011-2017 Achievements and Challenges to the 2030 Path. Special edition";"";"The current context in the Sahel-Saharan Band is clearly dominated by recurrent issues of desertification, land degradation and climate change. 

The acuteness and the importance of these challenges and their impacts on ecosystems, communities, and local populations in terms of sustainable management of natural resources, adaptation and resilience to climate change, socio-economic development of soils, as well as management of migratory flows and securing Sahelian lands remain at
the heart of the concerns of Sahel-Saharan states and particularly those south of the Sahara. This difficult and persistent situation in the Sahel amply justifies the priority that African leaders and the entire international community attach to the effective and efficient management of these challenges in the Sahel-Saharan band (SSB). By creating the Great Green Wall Initiative (GGWI), the Heads of State and Government of the South Sahara countries, who are among the hardest hit by this situation, have echoed the distress call of the Sahelian band population and their local communities’ soils and the international community call. It is a matter of creating and implementing a strong and united African alliance through the Great Green Wall Initiative to tackle climate and environmental challenges together. The GGWI is the demonstration of leadership, change in basic assumptions and strategies of approach of the Sahel-Saharan band states to face the environmental and climatic and socio-economic development issues. It is also the result of a new concept and an innovative instrument for the sustainable management of natural capital,adaptation, and resilience to climate change of communities and local populations through regional cooperation built on the principles of solidarity and cooperation of
actions. It is also a model for integrated development and local governance of Sahel soils. To seal and strengthen this alliance and to demonstrate their commitment to the proper implementation of the GGW Initiative, the Heads of State and Government of the Sahelo-Saharan States, based on the GGWI created on June 17th, 2010, under the auspices of the African Union, the Pan African Agency of the Great Green Wall to ensure the coordination and monitoring of achievements as well as the mobilization of necessary resources.

The GGWI draws its substance and vision from the major international issues of the United Nations Framework Conventions on Desertification, Climate Change, Biodiversity, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2063 African Union Agenda. It is consistent with regional, sub-regional, national, and local initiatives and policies in this area and integrates the sociological and anthropological realities, the basic socio-economic needs of communities and local populations as well as the economic potential of the soils.
The GGW Initiative concerns the entire geographical fringe of the Circum-Sahara which ranges between the 100 and 400 mm isohyets of average rainfall. It is currently implemented in eleven (11) Sahel-Saharan countries of the Sahel band
from the South of the Sahara in the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea.

The Global Harmonized Strategy (GHS) for its implementation is the result of the consolidation of the National Strategies of the States participating to the GGW Initiative and included in the coherence frameworks of national sectoral policies and strategies. The sequential approach of the technical itinerary is based on a five-year plan established since 2011, through the 2011-2015 and 2016-2020 strategies.

This book entitled «Great Green Wall Initiative: Achievements from 2011 to 2017 and Challenges to the 2030 path», follows the two books published on the GGWI by Dia and Duponnois in 2011 and 2013 on the Great Green Wall. Its objective is to be a reference to better understand the Initiative, including the GGW concept and its relevance, the African vision, the multisectoral, holistic and ecosystem aspects and sequential approach. It also allows us to better understand the important steps taken towards the translation of the GGWI vision into tangible realities and positive impacts on ecosystems, communities, and local populations of the soils. It outlines the institutional achievements of the PAGGW and the main achievements in terms of key operational activities of SLM and Community Development and the analysis of
their ecological impacts and economic development in the areas of the GGW route.

The book describes and analyzes country by country on the one hand, the main achievements with socio-economic impacts in terms of the fight against poverty and malnutrition, job creation, wealth generation and strengthening of social cohesion and on the other hand, the planned constraints, and solutions.

"UNCCD:1576";"Sustainability Index for Landscape Restoration";"";"Restoration is more complex than just planting trees. It requires that farmers, rural communities, businesses, and government agencies—all with different interests—unite behind a shared vision. Establishing common goals and measuring progress facilitates deeper collaboration among diverse actors. The World Resources Institute, together with the Government of El Salvador, the Regional Program for Research on Development and Environment (PRISMA), and the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ), created the Sustainability Index for Landscape Restoration in a diverse, 1,200 square kilometer landscape. The Sustainability Index for Landscape Restoration is a field-tested tool for measuring the impact of restoration efforts and can be used in countries willing to develop monitoring systems at the landscape level.

How the Index can help you to measure progress in Landscape restoration?

    Convene stakeholders involved in landscape management and monitoring
    Identify the desired impacts and definition of targets against a baseline
    Prioritize cost-effective components for the construction of the index
    Develop a landscape scoring to report on the status of the landscape against initial objectives.

"UNCCD:1599";"Goals and Commitments for the Restoration Decade. A global overview of countries’ restoration commitments under the Rio Conventions and other pledges";"";"The multiple benefits of restoration, from local to global scales, are reflected in the array of global and regional goals for restoration.
The year 2021 will see the kick-off of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration — a culmination of growing global attention, agreements and ambitions for restoration and improved land management. Measures that help to restore land and improve its management can offer multiple benefits to society simultaneously — contributing to food and water security, and helping to address biodiversity loss and mitigate and adapt to climate change. This diversity of benefits has resulted in restoration commitments submitted by countries across international conventions on climate, biodiversity and desertification and voluntary initiatives, such as the Bonn Challenge.

Quantitative commitments on restoration under the Rio Conventions and the Bonn Challenge have been submitted by 115 countries. The total global ambitions on restoration can be aggregated from the array of commitments countries have made under different conventions and goals. In total, 115 countries have put forward quantitative, area-based commitments to at least one of the three Rio Conventions (the CBD, UNCCD, UNFCCC) or to the Bonn Challenge. Many countries have provided commitments to more than one of these, many of which differing in size or type of restoration measures. Hence, the need to bring them together to take stock of the total global commitments.

The total of all restoration commitments by countries is close to 1 billion hectares, almost half of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa. The middle estimate in this policy brief totals close to 1 billion hectares (estimate range 765–1 billion hectares under various assumptions). This is significant, compared to current land use (4.7 billion ha cropland and grazing land), projections of land-use change (0.5 billion ha are expected to be converted into agriculture between 2010 and 2050), and estimates of land degradation (0.9 to 1.1 billion ha showing declining trends in productivity). Almost half of the restoration commitments are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Central and South America, China and South Asia. Relatively few commitments have been made by countries in North America, Europe, Russia, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. The commitments appear roughly balanced between planned measures that focus on restoration and protection of natural areas, and on management and rehabilitation of agricultural and forestry areas.

Efforts are required to improve the alignment, measurability and geographic specificity of commitments
National plans, in general, do not appear to be aligned between conventions when it comes to quantitative restoration commitments. Improvement, here, could enhance planning and implementation. Also, many countries have additional qualitative commitments for restoration that lack specificity and are difficult to measure and, thus, to evaluate or monitor. Commitments need to be measurable, geographically specific and transparent to create realistic targets and to help monitor progress, as well as provide transparency to land users. Differences in reporting styles also pose a challenge for comparing restoration commitments and progress on restoration within and between countries and conventions.

Opportunities to move from commitments to implementation
At the onset of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration in 2021, the plans and commitments are there, but how and to what extent these national plans and commitments will be implemented over the coming decade remains to be seen. The country commitments, and the overview presented here, could be used as a benchmark for evaluating implementation and reporting progress against existing commitments. There are upcoming opportunities to develop better alignment between restoration commitments under the different conventions and the Bonn Challenge, including new national plan cycles in, for instance, the CBD or UNFCCC, as well as the new restoration monitoring framework led by the FAO.";"Sewell, Annelies

"UNCCD:1603";"Catalogue of Innovations. Enhancing Smallholder Agriculture and Food System Resilience. East and Southern Africa";"";"The food system challenges require simultaneous action across different sectors and concerted efforts of diverse players in food systems. While past efforts inclined towards boosting gricultural production, today’s focus has shifted to influencing transformative changes to the entire food systems continuum, from production and processing to marketing and distribution, using innovative solutions.

Sub-Saharan Africa has been facing unprecedented challenges that affect the sustainability of food and agriculture systems, putting food and nutrition security at significant risk. The region has experienced alarming levels of natural resources deterioration in addition to the impacts of climate change, such as frequent droughts and floods.
The recent desert locust invasions in some of the East African countries will continue to exert pressure on food systems, threatening food security of more than two million households. The COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently raging across the world, is expected to have widespread impacts on overall global economic growth and disrupt food supply chains in several parts of the world. Border closures, quarantines and disruptions in input and output markets and trade will further restrict access to sufficient and nutritious sources of food for consumers. Already, global hunger and malnutrition are on the rise, with an estimated 821 million people experiencing chronic hunger. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa due to transport restrictions and quarantine measures are likely to impede the access of smallholder farmers to input and output markets, thereby decreasing their productive capacities.

Shortages of labour are also likely, which could disrupt production and processing of food, most notably for labour-intensive crops. Closure of domestic and international transport routes, particularly for fresh food supply chains, may also result in increased levels of food loss and reduced farm incomes.

The food system challenges require simultaneous actions across different sectors and concerted efforts of diverse players in food systems. While past efforts inclined towards boosting agricultural production, today’s focus has shifted towards influencing transformative changes to the entire food systems continuum – from production, to processing, marketing and distribution – using innovative solutions. 
In October 2019, the Sustainable Production Markets and Institutions (PMI) Division and the East and Southern Africa (ESA) Division of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) organized the Knowledge Sharing and Learning Event in Nairobi, Kenya, for partners implementing IFADsupported investment projects and grants across the ESA region. The event showcased several innovative interventions, approaches and tools that provide potential solutions to the challenges of smallholder farmers, resilience of foodsystems and inclusive transformation of poor rural people, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

About the catalogue
Through its investment projects and grants across the regions, IFAD has generated numerous innovative technologies, approaches and tools that provide solutions that contribute to the achievement of food and nutrition security and are targeted to addressing the challenges of climate change, natural resource management, youth unemployment, rural markets, empowerment of rural women, among others, and thereby also contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A set of 23 innovations from more than 10 countries in the ESA region that were shared during the Nairobi event have been documented in this Catalogue of Innovations. 

The detailed innovation fact sheets are presented in section 3 of this catalogue, while table 1 gives a quick overview of each innovation. The innovations cover a wide range of thematic topics: crop production, natural resource management, rural finance and markets, in addition to mainstreaming themes, such as youth and gender, climate change and livestock production systems, and food and nutrition. Innovations on crop production include modernizing agri-inputs distribution through an electronic voucher scheme for managing inputs and service subsidies, adoption of social media for effective programme delivery, and coordinating and supporting farmers through mobile plant clinics. The innovations on natural resource management include geospatial tools for tenure security, human-wildlife conflict management, decision dashboards for landscape-level baseline assessment and monitoring, Joint Village Land-Use Planning (JVLUP) for land tenure security, participatory development of Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF), taking successes in land restoration to scale and enhancing investment flows and governance for integrated natural resources management.

For rural finance and markets, the catalogue sets out innovations in public private- producer partnerships (4Ps) for agribusiness development, trading platforms to improve the competiveness of rural enterprises, a hub model used by cooperatives or privately owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to consolidate farm produce for marketing, and linking community-based financial institutions (CBFIs) to formal financial service providers (FSPs) through mobile money. The climate change and livestock production systems innovations include climate-smart dairy systems in East Africa and incentivebased interventions for reducing the climate impact of livestock production, also in East Africa. 

Food and nutrition innovation include interventions on food trees for diversified diets for smallholders in East Africa, fostering sustainability and resilience for food security in sub-Saharan Africa, and methodologies to mainstream nutrition-sensitive programming in rural markets. Finally, youth and gender innovation present initiatives that support the establishment of youth platforms in agribusiness and the creation of microenterprises and employment through incubators, rural youth employment and household methodologies for gender mainstreaming.

The Catalogue offers practical solutions and lessons for use by governments, private sector organizations, and bilateral and multilateral donors in shaping their response to the challenges of small-scale agriculture and food systems generally.";"";"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agriculture;food security;land degradation;land restoration;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;natural resources management;youth;youth";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1603";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1603_Innovations_Catalogue_FINAL.pdf";"";"";"";"100";"";""
"UNCCD:1626";"Small Grants Programme: 25 years of engagement with Indigenous Peoples";"";"A key purpose of this publication is to provide an account of SGP’s experience working with Indigenous Peoples over the last twenty-five years. The publication celebrates past achievements and advances critical lessons that can be used in forging new partnerships with Indigenous Peoples in future programming cycles, including opportunities to employ blended finance solutions. Building on the learning-by-doing experience gained over six Operational Phases, combining resources from the GEF with those of other bilateral donors, the SGP has cumulatively delivered financial support to over 25,000 community-based projects with civil society organizations in 133 countries at the global level. Among those countries, Indigenous Peoples’ have been vital partners in at least 94 countries.

UNDP and the GEF are committed to ensure that the operational insights, governance mechanisms, and risk-assessed flexibilities to administrative and procurement rules pioneered by the SGP are documented.
This body of experience can help Indigenous Peoples to become effectively engaged in these efforts not just through small grants but also expanding their capabilities to deal with medium and full-size GEFprojects. The publication notes that it is incumbent on the SGP, as a GEF Corporate Programme nested within the partnership of GEF agencies, to seek synergies and share solutions in acting as a tried-and-tested delivery mechanism.

As one of the early pioneers working with indigenous peoples, the experience of the Small Grants Programme (SGP), funded mainly by the Global Environment Facility and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has been repeatedly recognized as one of the “primary modalities of engagement” (IEO 2017) for indigenous peoples with the GEF.

This publication provides an account of GEF SGP’s experience working with indigenous peoples over the last 25 years. It also celebrates past achievements and advances critical lessons that can be used in forging new partnerships with indigenous peoples in future programming cycles, including opportunities to employ blended finance solutions.

GEF Focal Area and thematic distribution
SGP has provided grants to Indigenous Peoples across a range of thematic areas, needs and opportunities. Of those themes, biodiversity continues to be the dominant GEF focal area for SGP projects involving Indigenous Peoples, with the themes of climate change and land degradation steadily increasing. Since Indigenous Peoples often inhabit areas of high biological diversity, a strong correlation between areas of biological diversity and areas where high cultural diversity has been established. 
The aggregated totals of SGP projects are presented by region and by focal area in Figure 3. Approximately 51 percent of SGP projects working with Indigenous Peoples are allocated under the biodiversity focal area; 16 percent under climate change; 15 percent under land degradation; and the remaining 18 percent under international waters, chemicals and waste, and multi-focal area interventions. These figures are in line with the focal area distribution of the overall SGP portfolio, where biodiversity projects represent nearly half of the investments, while other focal area projects are increasing.

About:
SGP has supported over 20,000 community-based projects in biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation, prevention of land degradation, protection of international waters, and reduction of the impact of chemicals, while generating sustainable livelihoods.
The  GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) provides financial and technical support to communities and Civil Society Organizations to meet the overall objective of global environmental benefits secured through community-based initiatives and actions.  
Launched in 1992 with 33 participating countries, the Small Grants Programme has expanded to provide assistance to 125 countries currently. The SGP believes that community-driven and civil society-led initiatives can generate environmental benefits, while supporting sustainable livelihoods, gender equality and civil society empowerment. These are actions needed at the local and regional level to address global environmental challenges and complement other areas where the GEF works. 
Although Programme funding is modest, it enables communities to take measured risks. A poor and vulnerable community, for example, can use a small grant to develop capacity for a larger project. Once a community has proven the effectiveness of an innovative idea or strategy on the ground, it can often scale up impact through networking with other communities and partner organizations. These results, in turn, usually attract additional donors and government support for wider application.

"UNCCD:1642";"Dryland restoration successes in the Sahel and Greater Horn of Africa show how to increase scale and impact. Restoring African Drylands";"";"Drylands occupy more than 40% of the world’s land area and are home to some two billion people. This includes a disproportionate number of the world’s poorest people, who live in degraded and severely degraded landscapes. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification states on its website that 12 million hectares are lost annually to desertification and drought, and that more than 1.5 billion people are directly dependent on land that is being degraded, leading to US$42 billion in lost earnings each year. In Africa, three million hectares of forest are lost annually, along with an estimated 3% of GDP, through depleted soils. The result is that two-thirds of Africa’s forests, farmlands and pastures are now degraded. This means that millions of Africans have to live with malnutrition and poverty, and in the absence of options this further forces the poor to overexploit their natural resources to survive. This in turn intensifies the effects of climate change and hinders economic development, threatening ecological functions that are vital to national economies.

Dryland degradation can be reversed, recreating more resilient and productive landscapes that will fix more carbon especially in the soil, restore ecosystem services, promote new viable enterprises and create employment, while reducing conflicts and migration. And together, these will increase the opportunities to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and the targets of the Rio Conventions on desertification, climate change and biodiversity.

In response, there is growing momentum for dryland restoration, reflected in national commitments to the Bonn Challenge globally, and in Africa, by the Great Green Wall programme and the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100). Setting ambitious goals is laudable, but what is increasingly seen is that achieving them will require a change in approach as well as concerted action. At current rates of degradation, it appears that it will take a generation or more for most countries to reach their targets. So, how to speed up the process? And how can scarce financial resources be utilized more effectively? Improving our understanding of restoration successes and documenting the proven approaches, significant outcomes and lessons learned from such successes is a start. This edition of ETFRN News adds to the body of knowledge.

We are not yet winning the battle against land degradation in the drylands. In most countries, land degradation continues to outpace landscape restoration, meaning that each year more natural resources are lost. Substantially increasing funding to expand conventional approaches to support restoration does not seem to be a realistic option and experiences appear to show that unless well targeted, nor is it likely to be particularly effective. If we want to win the battle against land degradation — in the context of climate change, improving livelihoods and creating economic opportunities, especially for young people — then new approaches must be developed. More attention needs to be given to capitalize on what can be achieved through proven restoration practices, and to mobilize support for comprehensive and effective scaling strategies. 

This edition of ETFRN News contains inspiring examples of restoration successes in African drylands, several of which have already been scaled up. A key lesson is that the challenges of resource degradation can be sustainably addressed only when millions of farmers and pastoralists in each country decide to invest in relatively low-cost restoration actions, which already produce short-term economic and environmental benefits";"Reij, Chris

"UNCCD:1647";"Improving international soil governance – Analysis and recommendations. Final report";"";"This study develops options for the German government to improve international soil governance in the short, medium and long term. The study first takes stock of existing international instruments and institutions that are relevant for soil protection and its governance at the international level. It as-sesses the actual and potential steering effect of, inter alia, the Desertification Convention, the Biodiversity Convention, the Paris Agreement and climate regime, regional treaties, FAO, UNEP, IPBES and IPCC. At present, the Sustainable Development Goals and in particular the “land degradation neutrality” target have established a global political reference point. But there are almost no binding obliga-tions for all states specifically regarding soil. Current governance of soil at the international level is piecemeal and spread over parts of different mandates. 

There is significant overlap of mandates and activities of relevant institutions, each of which has limitations. While a certain degree of a rudimentary division of labour is emerging, there is scope and a need for improvement. The study develops options for improving international soil governance with regard to overarching issues, new treaty or institutions, improving existing governance, means of implementation and enhancing coordination and coherence.

The objective of this research report is to examine whether and how international governance for the purpose of sustainable soil management can be strengthened and improved in the short, medium and long term. The report has to two main parts: First, we take stock and assess existing international instruments and institutions that are relevant for soil protection and its governance at the international level, including an evaluation of their actual and potential steering effect. The study then develops options for improving international soil governance that the German government could pursue.

The report addresses the protection of soil. The term ""soil"" is not generally synonymous with ""land"", which is generally used to comprise not only soil-related issues, but also more dimensions and interactions with vegetation.

"UNCCD:1652";"Regreening the Sahel: A quiet agroecological evolution";"";"‘Over the past three decades hundreds of thousands of farmers in Burkina Faso and Niger, on the fringes of the Sahara Desert, have transformed large swathes of the region’s arid landscape into productive agricultural land, improving food security for about three million people. Once-denuded landscapes are now home to abundant trees, crops, and livestock.'

Sahelian farmers, driven to desperation by the great droughts of the early 1970s and the 1980s, have ingeniously modified traditional agroforestry, water and soil management practices to restore the fertility of their land. In Niger, farmers have developed innovative ways to regenerate and multiply valuable trees whose roots already lay under their land. This ‘farmer-managed natural regeneration’ (FMNR) was first pioneered by outside actors but was spread rapidly by farmers once they observed its success. Changes to forestry laws and reforms of government structures that enable greater decentralization and local control of natural resources have also been significant enablers of change.

In Burkina Faso, local farmers – of whom the 78-year-old Yacouba Sawadogo, winner of a Right Livelihood Award in 2018 (considered ‘the Alternative Nobel Prizes), is perhaps the most famous – experimented with zaï, which are planting pits containing manure to retain moisture and nutrients, and with stone bunds known as diguettes to hold back rainwater and allow it to soak into the soil. Farmers like Sawadogo deliberately set about leading the spread of successful techniques to their neighbours and then further afield, by creating farmer-to-farmer spaces, schools and networks, supported in their efforts by a wide range of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The results have been improved food security for some three million people; increases in household gross incomes, by an average of 18– 24%; the reversal of environmental degradation and desertification across some 6m hectares of land (an area three times the size of Wales); and around 200m new trees being grown, with a production value of over $260m. Improvements in nutrition may, in turn, help build resilience to future health pandemics.

Climatically, the changes have meant decreased soil erosion, reduced wind speed, decreases in local temperatures and increases in rainfall, along with greater biodiversity. There is also some evidence that such techniques can reduce conflict locally, both through the process itself – i.e. the negotiations between potentially competing groups that successful agroecology entails – and as a result of increasing the size of the ‘resource cake’ available to all.

Agroecology (see Box 1) in the Sahel has thus become well-known for both its multiple benefits and the ways it has spread, which have been characterized as farmer-to-farmer, people-to-people, bottom-up development, working with nature – which is contrasted with misguided, damaging, top-down, ‘experts know best’ engineering approaches to the environment and human development. Agroecological thinking is a continually evolving, living and flexible system, in contrast with stereotypical ‘project’ thinking, which is short-term, time-constrained and inflexible. This is not, however, to discount the potential positive role of other new technological advances in helping feed the world’s population.

Box 1: Agroecology

Agroecology is both a science and a set of principles. It was created by the convergence of two scientific disciplines: agronomy and ecology. The core principles include recycling nutrients and energy on the farm, rather than introducing external inputs; integrating crops and livestock; diversifying species and genetic resources; and focusing on interactions and productivity across the agricultural system, rather than focusing on individual species. Agroecology is highly knowledge-intensive, based on techniques that are not delivered top-down but developed on the basis of farmers’ knowledge and experimentation.

A meta-analysis of 143 studies of soil and water conservation measures (SWCM) in Burkina Faso concludes:

‘It can therefore be concluded that the introduction of SWCM in Burkina Faso has improved agricultural productivity and food security, economic security, groundwater tables, tree regeneration, and biodiversity. It has also been efficient in reducing migration and poverty in the Sahel, especially in areas with a larger proportion of farmers and herders. These measures should be extended to other countries of sub-Saharan Africa with a similar physiographic and socioeconomic situation, such as Niger and Mali, since they have proven to be workable initiatives to improve food security and crop yield while conserving the natural vegetation and establishing a more resilient climate change adaptation and mitigation means of agriculture. Additionally, the involvement of the local farmers makes them rely on their own resources and see the government and other agencies as secondary support. It is therefore essential for project organizers to recognize the importance of building on experience and improving on local soil and water conservation (SWC) measures by promoting simple and low-cost technologies. The strengthening and reorganization of institutions is also necessary to help promote and oversee the successful implementation of SWCM.’

Key Insights

What farmers have achieved in 30 years across the Sahel, one of the most fragile zones on the planet, has been described as ‘the greatest agroecological success story in Africa, and perhaps anywhere’. 6 It demonstrates how environmental health is the basis of sustainable development, food security and poverty reduction; without fertile soil, no life is possible.

This case study shows how innovation and shared learning processes developed by farmers, facilitated by INGOs and also by government policy and action, can address key structural causes of poverty, catalyse horizontal scaling and contribute to poverty reduction.

But environmental health cannot be renewed and sustained just because it is a good thing. This case study shows that people’s willingness to invest energy and resources is increased or decreased depending on how far economic and political systems help or hinder those efforts. A key insight is that environmental and political trends are interdependent and act upon each other, influencing each other’s form and trajectory; as one study observes: ‘Woodland decline only reinforced centralization of power and local economic decline, and regreening sped power decentralization and local economic revival.’

The poorest people – who are extremely vulnerable – have the most to gain from regreening, but it is still unlikely to be enough to make them food-secure in severe droughts through their own production or the ability to earn cash to buy food. Therefore, enhanced environmental sustainability needs to be matched by enhanced social protection and by markets that work for all and exploration of other inclusive solutions Building some of the structures used in soil and water conservation techniques, notably zaï and stone diguettes, requires considerable labour, which can increase workloads for women. They also require money for transport, and so relatively better-off farmers are better placed to implement these techniques (in turn employing local labour). However, women may benefit greatly in the longer term due to increased food production and better access to fuel, fodder and water.

Sustainable land management specialist Chris Reij, a Senior Fellow at the World Resources Institute (WRI), argues that now (2020) the time is ripe for an enormous expansion: heightened concerns about the intersecting climate and food crises at global, regional and national levels mean that there are political incentives for national governments and international donors to focus on agroecology, understand its multiple poverty, environmental and climatic benefits (both for climate change mitigation and for adaptation) and therefore scale it up massively.

As regreening has progressed, and as climate and environmental concerns have increased everywhere, farmers and civil society organizations (CSOs) in other Sahelian countries have joined in (in Senegal, Mali, Ghana and elsewhere). Governments in the region and donor governments have – to some extent – been inspired to change policies to assist agroecological approaches.

Notably, the Government of Niger has made an ambitious pledge to restore 3.2m hectares of degraded land by 20309 (266,000 hectares per year), and so it needs strategies to make that happen: the learning from this case study indicates that large-scale agroecology, especially FMNR, is the best way to do it. Other governments in the Sahel have made similar ambitious policy commitments as part of a multi-government project to restore forests across 100m hectares by 2030 called the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, or AFR100. This was launched in 2015 by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the World Bank, the WRI and Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The even more ambitious Bonn Challenge target is to restore 350m hectares of forest worldwide by 2030. Importantly, FMNR and other agroecological approaches are also influencing the ‘Great Green Wall of Africa’ initiative by Sahelian governments. This grandiose vision, which all governments in the Sahel have bought into, is increasingly being modified from its original concept as a vast (new) tree-planting scheme commanded from above to something more varied and appropriate and therefore more likely to succeed. Building upon existing successes in natural regeneration, it could resemble a green mosaic more than a green wall. Yacouba Sawadogo’s Right Livelihood Award in 2018 gave further impetus to this. Internationally, FMNR has spread beyond the Sahel to over two dozen countries, from Haiti to Indonesia.

However, there are many challenges that could stymie regreening initiatives and even reverse progress so far, including impacts from the climate crisis, population growth, changing social structures, land grabs and competition for land, and increasing conflicts, which are spilling dangerously across borders.

Much more needs to be done by all parties to achieve the AFR100 vision and make agroecological approaches and regeneration of vegetation the core of the landscape restoration process and not just an add-on.
Drawing on experience to date, Reij has suggested a six-step ‘scalable techniques and scaling strategy’ for national governments and international donors. These six steps are:

    To identify and analyse existing regreening successes;

    Build a grassroots movement for regreening and mobilize partner organizations;

    Address policy and legal issues and improve enabling conditions for regreening;

    Develop and implement a communication strategy;

    Develop or strengthen agroforestry value chains;

    Expand research activities.

"UNCCD:1657";"Peoples' Climate Vote. Results";"";"UNDP's ""Peoples' Climate Vote"" reflects over half the world's population after results processed by the University of Oxford. Sixty-four percent of people believe climate change is a global emergency, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic

New York - The results of the Peoples’ Climate Vote, the world’s biggest ever survey of public opinion on climate change are published today. Covering 50 countries with over half of the world’s population, the survey includes over half a million people under the age of 18, a key constituency on climate change that is typically unable to vote yet in regular elections.

Detailed results broken down by age, gender, and education level will be shared with governments around the world by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which organized the innovative poll with the University of Oxford. In many participating countries, it is the first time that large-scale polling of public opinion has ever been conducted on the topic of climate change. 2021 is a pivotal year for countries’ climate action commitments, with a key round of negotiations set to take place at the UN Climate Summit in November in Glasgow, UK. 

In the survey, respondents were asked if climate change was a global emergency and whether they supported eighteen key climate policies across six action areas: economy, energy, transport, food & farms, nature and protecting people.  

Results show that people often want broad climate policies beyond the current state of play. For example, in eight of the ten survey countries with the highest emissions from the power sector, majorities backed more renewable energy. In four out of the five countries with the highest emissions from land-use change and enough data on policy preferences, there was majority support for conserving forests and land. Nine out of ten of the countries with the most urbanized populations backed more use of clean electric cars and buses, or bicycles.  

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: ""The results of the survey clearly illustrate that urgent climate action has broad support amongst people around the globe, across nationalities, age, gender and education level. But more than that, the poll reveals how people want their policymakers to tackle the crisis. From climate-friendly farming to protecting nature and investing in a green recovery from COVID-19, the survey brings the voice of the people to the forefront of the climate debate. It signals ways in which countries can move forward with public support as we work together to tackle this enormous challenge.""

The innovative survey was distributed across mobile gaming networks in order to include hard-to-reach audiences in traditional polling, like youth under the age of 18. Polling experts at the University of Oxford weighted the huge sample to make it representative of the age, gender, and education population profiles of the countries in the survey, resulting in small margins of error of +/- 2%.

Policies had wide-ranging support, with the most popular being conserving forests and land (54% public support), more solar, wind and renewable power (53%), adopting climate-friendly farming techniques (52%) and investing more in green businesses and jobs (50%). 

Prof. Stephen Fisher, Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, said: “The survey - the biggest ever survey of public opinion on climate change - has shown us that mobile gaming networks can not only reach a lot of people, they can engage different kinds of people in a diverse group of countries. The Peoples’ Climate Vote has delivered a treasure trove of data on public opinion that we’ve never seen before. Recognition of the climate emergency is much more widespread than previously thought. We’ve also found that most people clearly want a strong and wide-raging policy response.”

The survey shows a direct link between a person’s level of education and their desire for climate action. There was very high recognition of the climate emergency among those who had attended university or college in all countries, from lower-income countries such as Bhutan (82%) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (82%), to wealthy countries like France (87%) and Japan (82%). 

When it comes to age, younger people (under 18) were more likely to say climate change is an emergency than older people. Nevertheless, other age groups were not far behind, with 65% of those aged 18-35, 66% aged 36-59 and 58% of those over 60, illustrating how widely held this view has become.

"UNCCD:1671";"FUTURE BRIEF: The solution is in nature";"";"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) work with nature to benefit both natural ecosystems and the people that depend on them. By putting nature at the centre, NbS address a range of societal challenges: protecting, sustainably managing or restoring natural or modified ecosystems and supporting their health, function and biodiversity.

The research collated in this brief confirms that NbS deliver simultaneously multiple benefits and shows the wide-ranging beneficial impacts of scaling up their implementation across Europe.

Time for action is urgent. Globally, ecosystems are being degraded and lost in an unprecedented manner, leading to the loss of the associated services they provide (resources and contributions that either directly or indirectly support human well-being and survival). Drivers include climate change and unsustainable urbanisation. By 2050, over 80% of the European population2 (and nearly 70% of the global population)3 is expected to reside in urban areas, increasing the need for sustainable food, housing, employment and care in cities – and increasing the amount of land needed for human activities.

Some examples of NbS include restoring forest landscapes for food and water security; integrating green infrastructure (such as green roofs and community spaces) into urban planning to improve human health and well-being and to address climate change mitigation (by cooling city areas during periods of hot weather); protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems to simultaneously safeguard human settlements from storm surges, wind or wave erosion risk and create safe nurseries for aquatic species; and sustainably managing agricultural soils to increase ecosystem resilience for climate adaptation.

For the Bonn Challenge Barometer protocol for forest land restoration (FLR), the central indicator “under restoration”, is a set of measures put in place that slow, and then reverse, the degradation status of key ecological, social and economic indicators. In addition to the central indicator, other indicators in this category are climate impacts, biodiversity impacts and socio-economic impacts. Data collection for these indicators overlaps with other reporting commitments, and explicit guidance is provided on this so data providers do not have to duplicate work, and can use this tool to aid with reporting under other international commitments and frameworks (e.g. climate change and UNFCCC reporting on mitigation outcomes from the land and forest sector, biodiversity impacts and the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets).

Such images are all too familiar. Across the globe, soil degradation and desertification cost about 490 billion euros per year, according to expert estimates. ""About 12 million hectares of land are lost to this every year"" says Wageningen soil physicist Coen Ritsema of Alterra Wageningen UR. ‘That is equivalent to half the land surface of the UK.’ 

Desertification takes hold for a number of reasons. Soils can be damaged by water and wind erosion, salinization, overgrazing, drought and forest fires. Forest fires alone send a surface area the size of India and Pakistan up in flames every year. Sometimes the forest comes back afterwards. But if forest fires and periods of drought follow close on each other’s heels, the soils and the stock of seeds they harbour become exhausted. In the end nothing grows there anymore and the land is irretrievably lost. The international project DESIRE is studying the options for more sustainable land use under dry conditions.

"UNCCD:200000217";"Land degradation neutrality ( in The Mediterranean region under climate change : a scientific update)";"";"This chapter sets out to present a short review of 
(i) the general context of land degradation under the framework of UNCCD – the international convention on desertification with a specific focus on Land Degradation Neutrality, and (ii) examples of the main processes responsible for soil degradation (e.g. surface crusting, runoff and water erosion, tillage erosion, wind erosion, and salinization), along with the principles of desertification control and land rehabilitation, in light of the socioeconomic context and ecological conditions and processes. It also focuses on two other key considerations for land restoration: the conservation/ increase of soil carbon stocks (see Tunisian example), and the biological restoration of functioning soil through the management of mycorrhizal fungi. 

Although there is plentiful scientific evidence for strategies to prevent land degradation and/or restore 
degraded land, new knowledge is needed to step up the fight against land degradation and allow Mediterranean ecosystems to deliver appropriate sustainable services. This chapter cites examples of these scientific gaps (e.g. sensitivity of soil organic matter to temperature increases, the dynamics of inorganic carbon and deep soil organic, and the most effective Plant-AM in ensuring the success of restoration programmes)

"UNCCD:200000291";"Land degradation states and trends in the northwestern Maghreb drylands, 1998–2008";"";"States of ecological maturity and temporal trends of drylands in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia north of 28 N are reported for 1998–2008. The input data were Normalized Difference Vegetation Index databases and corresponding climate fields, at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of one month. States convey opposing dynamics of human exploitation and ecological succession. 

They were identified synchronically for the full period by comparing each location to all other locations in the study area under equivalent aridity. Rain Use Efficiency (RUE) at two temporal scales was used to estimate proxies for biomass and turnover rate. Biomass trends were determined for every location by stepwise regression using time and aridity as predictors. This enabled human-induced degradation to be separated from simple responses to interannual climate variation. 

Some relevant findings include large areas of degraded land, albeit improving over time or fluctuating with climate, but rarely degrading further; smaller, but significant areas of mature and reference vegetation in most climate zones; very low overall active degradation rates throughout the area during the decade observed; biomass accumulation over time exceeding depletion in most zones; and negative feedback between land states and trends suggesting overall landscape persistence. Semiarid zones were found to be the most vulnerable. Those results can be disaggregated by country or province. 

The combination with existing land cover maps and national forest inventories leads to the information required by the two progress indicators associated with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification strategic objective to improve the conditions of ecosystems and with the Sustainable Development Goal Target 15.3 to achieve land degradation neutrality. Beyond that, the results are also useful as a basis for land management and restoration.";"del Barrio, Gabriel

"UNCCD:200000316";"Soil-related Sustainable Development Goals: Four concepts to make land degradation neutrality and restoration work";"";"In the effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food, health, water, and climate, an increase in pressure on land is highly likely. To avoid further land degradation and promote land restoration, multifunctional use of land is needed within the boundaries of the soil-water system. In addition, awareness-raising, a change in stakeholders’ attitudes, and a change in economics are essential. 

The attainment of a balance between the economy, society, and the biosphere calls for a holistic approach. In this paper, we introduce four concepts that we consider to be conducive to realizing LDN in a more integrated way: systems thinking, connectivity, nature-based solutions, and regenerative economics. 

The authors illustrate the application of these concepts through three examples in agricultural settings. Systems thinking lies at the base of the three others, stressing feedback loops but also delayed responses. Their simultaneous use will result in more robust solutions, which are sustainable from an environmental, societal, and economic point of view. Solutions also need to take into account the level of scale (global, national, regional, local), stakeholders’ interests and culture, and the availability and boundaries of financial and natural capital. Furthermore, sustainable solutions need to embed short-term management in long-term landscape planning. 

In conclusion, paradigm shifts are needed. First, it is necessary to move from excessive exploitation in combination with environmental protection, to sustainable use and management of the soil-water system. To accomplish this, new business models in robust economic systems are needed based on environmental systems thinking; an approach that integrates environmental, social, and economic interests. Second, it is necessary to shift from a “system follows function” approach towards a “function follows system” one. 

Only by making the transition towards integrated solutions based on a socio-economical-ecological systems analysis, using concepts such as nature-based solutions, do we stand a chance to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030. To make these paradigm shifts, awareness-raising in relation to a different type of governance, economy and landscape and land-use planning and management is needed.";"Keesstra, Saskia

"UNCCD:200000478";"Sustainable land use for mitigation";"";"The latest IPCC report highlights that a change in diets for richer nations, and smarter land use, could ensure food security and mitigation of potential climate impacts.

Land surface processes — agriculture, forestry and other land use — account for 28% of anthropogenic emissions. However, natural land processes absorb about a third of the emissions from fossil fuel burning and energy production. 

Although only 1% of the world’s land surface is taken up by infrastructure, according to the latest IPCC report (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/), there have been great changes to the surface throughout human history, 
> with 12–14% of ice-free land now being used for cropping, 
>37% being grasslands that are used for grazing and other purposes, and 
>22% being managed or planted forests. 
This leaves only about 28% of ice-free land untouched or minimally touched by humans, highlighting that there are many areas ripe for better management and use. Such improvements could lessen, but not solve, the need for climate mitigation.

Food security and diet feature heavily in the new report, as it is essential for survival that regional food supply is maintained. Productivity will need to be maintained or increased in a changing climate, but improved systems are needed to reduce the losses from production and waste that account for about a third of food produced. 

Food has already been in the spotlight this year, with the release in January of the EAT–Lancet commission1, which focused on diet, health and planetary boundaries (as discussed in our March editorial2) and found that a change in diet would benefit both human and planetary health. That message is reinforced by the IPCC report. Dietary changes, particularly in the richer nations which have high levels of meat consumption, would free up land for other uses, as well as reducing emissions by up to 8 Gt CO2-equivalent per year, relative to business as usual.

Deforestation, degradation and desertification all threaten land carbon sinks. Approximately 500 million people live in areas at risk of desertification, and climate change exacerbates the risks in these areas as well as drylands.";"";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2019-12-31";"en";"climate change;desertification;food security;land restoration;land use";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land & Food Security;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/200000478";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/478_Article_s41558-019-0575-9.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""
"UNCCD:200000550";"“Global Safety Net” to reverse biodiversity loss and stabilize Earth’s climate";"";"Global strategies to halt the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change are often formulated separately, even though they are interdependent and risk failure if pursued in isolation. The Global Safety Net maps how expanded nature conservation addresses both overarching threats. We identify 50% of the terrestrial realm that, if conserved, would reverse further biodiversity loss, prevent CO2 emissions from land conversion, and enhance natural carbon removal. This framework shows that, beyond the 15.1% land area currently protected, 35.3% of land area is needed to conserve additional sites of particular importance for biodiversity and stabilize the climate. Fifty ecoregions and 20 countries contribute disproportionately to proposed targets. Indigenous lands overlap extensively with the Global Safety Net. Conserving the Global Safety Net could support public health by reducing the potential for zoonotic diseases like COVID-19 from emerging in the future.

Approximately half of Earth’s terrestrial surface is considered to be in a natural or seminatural condition (1, 2). How does this remaining habitat overlap with global conservation priorities and carbon storage requirements? This paper highlights sites of particular importance for biodiversity where additional conservation attention is needed, and other intact lands of high value for carbon storage and other ecosystem services. It also depicts the coincidence and disparities between terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage priorities. This spatially explicit output, entitled the Global Safety Net for saving life on Earth, is intended to be a dynamic tool to support multilateral, national, and subnational land use planning efforts.

While the parallel crises of biodiversity loss and climate change have generally been approached separately, a key solution for two of the most pressing challenges of our time is the same: conserve enough nature and in the right places.

Here, the authors are using the Global Deal for Nature as a guiding framework, we examine where conservation of the terrestrial realm could be scaled to support biodiversity by securing additional lands to improve the resilience of ecosystems and secure terrestrial carbon stocks, both of which are essential if we are to have a chance of achieving the 1.5°C goal. The Global Safety Net explicitly avoids areas of concentrated human settlement, but it does not exclude resident human populations at relatively low densities in remote areas. We view this as a positive because, in particular, the sustained presence of indigenous communities within intact areas can have long-term benefits for both biodiversity and carbon storage.

One potential application of the Global Safety Net is to inform the development of “common but differentiated” targets under the new post-2020 framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It could also help guide land-based mitigation in Nationally Determined Contributions made under the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change. The digital map of the Global Safety Net can be disaggregated by country, ecoregion, and indigenous territory, to shed light on overarching questions: How much does an ecoregion or country contribute to meeting global biodiversity targets? Do ecoregions identified as priorities for biodiversity protection also contribute disproportionately to carbon storage? What is the potential role of indigenous peoples’ lands in supporting biodiversity protection and climate stabilization? Which ecoregions and countries will require the greatest investment in connectivity? At a local scale, the Global Safety Net can serve as a framework to align subnational land use planning efforts with global conservation and climate targets. The reverse is also imperative, as regional conservation planning efforts can replace various parts of the global layers where they are available.

Elements of the terrestrial Global Safety Net
We anchored the Global Safety Net with the current network of global protected areas (14). This network performs fairly well in representing sites important to narrow-range endemic vertebrates, yet gaps remain (15). The Global Safety Net fills in those gaps and targets other elements of biodiversity that need additional conservation attention. We built the Global Safety Net by mapping a comprehensive set of biodiversity elements to determine how much unprotected land needs increased conservation attention. To the extent possible, we included only remaining habitat and avoided agricultural lands. We then assessed where additional conservation measures are needed to achieve climate targets. Third, we created a preliminary network of wildlife and climate corridors to connect remaining natural habitat.

Restoration
One overlooked area of research that should inform future iterations of the Global Safety Net is the restoration opportunities on degraded lands (30). These degraded landscapes could be restored to address both climate and biodiversity concerns. Further, reconnecting forest corridors in degraded lands could offset emissions that will occur before a moratorium on land-based emissions is reached. Focusing restoration efforts on degraded lands that can serve as wildlife corridors could help achieve other objectives, such as the Bonn Challenge (31). Similarly, massive tree-planting programs, if designed using native species and planted to restore corridors, riparian and coastal vegetation, and upper watersheds, could contribute to stabilizing climate and restoring connectivity.

Indigenous lands
The overlay of mapped indigenous territories with spatial targets 1 to 3 reveals an extensive overlap of 37% and underscores the central role that indigenous peoples and their lands play to preserve biodiversity and regulate Earth’s atmosphere (26, 33, 34). Another observation is echoed by other conservation biologists who have examined maps of indigenous lands and global biodiversity priorities: A 30% area–based target for protection by 2030, as advocated by many groups to the Convention on Biological Diversity, effectively already exists when accounting for indigenous lands, should effectively conserved lands be formally acknowledged by governments as other area-based effective conservation measures (OECMs) (35). In short, the “30 × 30” target is far less ambitious when viewed through this perspective. Many conservation organizations, indigenous peoples, and local communities have called for an area-based target of “at least 50%” under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Explicit in these calls is to allow for the protection of the land rights and traditional management practices of communities most at risk to food insecurity, the negative impacts of land degradation, and climate change.

Can a Global Safety Net be created in time?
There are reasons to support the notion that a Global Safety Net encompassing approximately 50% of land area is achievable. Addressing indigenous land claims, upholding existing land tenure rights, and resourcing programs on indigenous-managed lands could help achieve biodiversity objectives on as much as one-third of the area required by the Global Safety Net. Simultaneously, this focus would positively address social justice and human rights concerns. In addition, economists are examining pathways for scaling conservation and restoration across all land jurisdictions (36). New research from the World Economic Forum ties half the world’s gross domestic product—$44 trillion dollars—directly to nature and its services (37). The recent COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the ability of the world’s governments to mobilize trillions of dollars, and there are a number of proposals emerging to tie environmental restoration and climate response to economic recovery. CSAs offer one framework to move beyond the incrementalism of protected area designation over the past couple of decades. Last, a key finding of this study is that species closest to the brink of extinction or where rare species concentrate could be protected by an addition of only 2.3% more land area if allocated to the right places and well managed. That target should be achievable within 5 years.

Similar to the Paris Climate Agreement, and in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15), a Global Deal for Nature calls for common but differentiated contributions by every nation on Earth toward the collective goal of protecting ecosystems, halting land degradation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Most conservation efforts and land use decisions are local or regional in nature, and implementation of the Global Safety Net will occur from the ground up, by district, state, province, and nation. 

While our analysis makes a distinction between areas managed for biodiversity and those additional areas managed for climate stabilization, a target could still be reached if land were designated as a CSA and managed for priority species. In the current environment, we could also envision intact areas set aside under a pandemic prevention program. These natural habitats would be managed and protected to avoid conversion and reduce human contact with pathogens that lead to zoonotic diseases in areas of high risk. Protecting wildlife in these pandemic prevention areas from overhunting, restricting access to bat caves and roosts, could also reduce the potential for more catastrophic outbreaks.";"Dinerstein, E.

"UNCCD:200000555";"Heading towards an unsustainable world: some of the implications of not achieving the SDGs";"";"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were conceived at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 (Rio + 20), and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015. They are part of a larger framework, namely the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Since then, many countries round the world have been engaging in respect of their implementation. The slow progress seen in the implementation of the SDGs, is in contrast with the many negative implications of not implementing them. This paper outlines the relevance of the SDGs, the barriers currently seen in respect of their implementation and outlines what is at stake, if they are not duly implemented. To accomplish this, a thorough literature review of contributions published in the field of SDGs in English between the years 2012–2020 was performed.

Introduction: the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals
During the past centuries, almost all the systems have been developed through natural processes. However, with the technological advancements today, development is moving faster than our expectations. Therefore, having no plan for well-being and environment can cause serious problems to the future societies. As a result of the fast-moving unbalanced economic growth, the world’s systems may lose their ability to adjust with the people’s well-being which also significantly affect the environment. In this era, having a systematic action plan can definitely help to focus on a common perspective.

To this end, on 25 September 2015, countries in UN adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), representing a new coherent way of thinking about ecological, social, and economic issues that are inter-related [1]. Considering as the “transformative agenda” [2], the SDGs address all the critical and major global challenges that threat the future, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice, necessarily entails an integrated approach.
Different studies have analyzed challenges and opportunities of the SDGs [3, 4]. Some scholars and practitioners have referred to the fact that these goals are not easy to achieve due to the diversity of the elements involved [5]. Moreover, the importance of including interdependencies between the goals [6, 7], taking a nexus approach [8,9,10], and strengthening governance and institutions [11] have been highlighted in some studies in order to achieve these goals. Nevertheless, the significance of the SDGs can be viewed from different perspectives. For instance:
Addressing essential human needs. As the world population grows fast, there is an essential need for the basics of life such as drinking water, food, and shelter. To achieve this, appropriate establishment of plans as well as creating infrastructures are able to guarantee the sustainability of these basic needs for long term periods.

Not protecting biodiversity and territorial ecosystems would lead species to extinction (or risk of being extinct) [66]. Erosion, deforestation and land degradation would affect millions of people, especially due to loss of essential services of well-being and land productivity [67]. Preservation of biodiversity and different ecosystems is fundamental to climate regulation, so this could be an irreparable loss and worsen extreme weather events.

"UNCCD:600000098";"Farmers’ strategies for adapting to climate change in Niger. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"The West African Sahel is very vulnerable to the effects of climate change, due to land degradation, dependence on rainfed farming, political instability, poor governance, food insecurity, terrorism, poor infrastructure, and limited technical capacity. This has particular impacts on the agricultural sector (Sissoko et al. 2011; Zougmoré et al. 2016).

High levels of poverty and illiteracy also challenge agriculture, alongside a lack of adequate agricultural policies and agricultural investment, and limited mechanization. Conflict also affects agricultural societies and pastoral activities (Snorek et al. 2014). In addition, there is population pressure. Niger has the world highest population growth (INS 2016), which leads to agricultural saturation, the now total absence of fallowing land and increased landuse conflicts.

Agricultural systems in the West African Sahel are vulnerable to climate change. Farmers in Niger have developed many adaptation strategies, which provide myriad services with socioeconomic and ecological benefits. 

These include zai pits, stone bunds, mulching, crop rotation, multiple cropping systems, half-moons, filtering dikes, fertilizer micro-doses, use of manure, and farmer managed natural regeneration. Strategies also include pest control measures, use of drought-tolerant and early maturing crops varieties, improved crop storage facilities, and use of timely and accurate weather forecasting.

Some adaptation measures involve the use of land law and environmental law to regulate the use of resources. In addition, farmers reduce risks through loans from agricultural banks to invest in irrigation infrastructure and agricultural inputs. These measures are being considered at the highest level, such as in the national strategy and plan for climate change adaption in the agricultural sector 2020 (République du Niger 2020). Now it is hoped that these strategies can be adequately financed and effectively implemented so farmers and pastoralists alike can have the support they require to
adopt more climate-smart practices and improve their livelihoods.";"Moussa, Soulé

"UNCCD:600000099";"Adoption of farmer managed natural regeneration in Senegal. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"Valuable lessons can be learned from smallholder farmers who have successfully protected and regenerated tree cover across agricultural landscapes in Senegal, with minimal reliance on tree nurseries, seedling distribution or tree planting. In the process, they have restored soil fertility to sustainably increase agricultural production.

Analysing how and where this approach has occurred underscores the importance and feasibility of achieving restoration in ways that contribute to improved livelihoods, reduce vulnerability to climate change and other shocks, and restore ecosystem services. This article highlights a relatively low-cost intervention implemented by rural communities with support from development organizations and that could be widely replicated.

Based on experiences in Senegal and elsewhere across the Sahel, successful restoration can be initiated and sustained by smallholder farmers and local communities. Mobilizing support for cross-visits and farmer-to-farmer exchanges has been especially important in motivating behavioural changes.

Support for peer-to-peer training about FMNR and other improved natural resource management practices have also been crucial in enabling smallholders to overcome the biophysical constraints of dryland agriculture, including weathered and leached soils, loss of soil organic matter, highly variable rainfall, and high rates of runoff. Additional capacity building and training in institutional development and enterprise management, and support for decentralized land-use planning, participatory forest management and tenure policy modifications have also been important.

The path to success includes taking steps to strengthen local governance and diversify local economies. The full participation of key stakeholders in community-based land-use planning is essential, together with the devolution of authority to local communities to enable the formulation and local enforcement of rules governing access to and use of natural resources. For restoration to be fully successful requires that stakeholders work together to market the products of protected and managed trees across agricultural landscapes, while providing for equitable benefit distribution (Dororetz et al. 2014). Institutional and regulatory reforms are also needed to establish more favourable enabling
conditions, and to provide programme support that addresses factors related to community organization, governance and other aspects highlighted in this example of successful restoration. Using such experiences can clearly inform the required changes, shorten the process, and lead to more effective reforms (Reij and Winterbottom 2015).";"Winterbottom, Robert

"UNCCD:600000100";"Restoration of agricultural landscapes and dry forests in Senegal. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"In the above initiatives, self-motivated populations increased food security and reduced vulnerabilities to climatic shocks by restoring and sustainably managing local forest resources. To regenerate agroforestry parklands, farmers built on traditional systems to increase on-farm tree density and convert degraded lands to densely wooded savannas. These actions increased crop yields and produced new sources of livestock browse. The population of Sambandé restored the local forest and managed it to sustainably produce fuel and fruit. The agroforestry parklands were restored without a project.
Modest project support helped the Sambandé community to establish local institutions that set and enforced rules that applied sound forest management practices and strengthened targeted value chains. Project assistance was phased out when the community’s capacity was sufficiently strong to manage the forest sustainably. The sustained achievements from the locally managed initiatives described above lie in stark contrast to the poor track record of longer-term impacts from many large, centrally controlled projects that focus more on infrastructure than on capacity building. 

While the Sambandé projects built the community’s capacity to exercise choices when managing forest resources and enterprises, centrally controlled projects often make critical decisions in the place of the ultimate beneficiaries, weakening the sense of local ownership and increasing the chance that forest management will not continue after the end of project.

The time and effort needed to scale up these successes have been much reduced by taking stock of what has worked. This includes identifying the changes that led to success, such as the transfer of rights and responsibilities, use of appropriate technologies, greater roles for local populations in developing forest value chains, and identifying the steps that established those changes, e.g., training, peer-to-peer visits, and policy modifications.";"Tappan, Gray

"UNCCD:600000102";"Climate-smart village approach: communities at the heart of restoration in Senegal. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"The climate-smart village approach created enthusiasm and commitment from farmers in seeking solutions to the problems and constraints that they themselves identified. The approach also involved strengthening the capacity of technical staff to use new tools, and to understand and support the new methods, with complementary finance to support the changes.

However, the success of regreening actions such as these requires a combination of legal, institutional, organizational, sociocultural, economic and ecological factors. A failure to consider any of these factors will hamper progress.
The remaining challenges include the limited involvement of local elected officials in environmental and state-owned commissions, and their lack of knowledge of decentralization laws. In addition, there are issues at the organizational and sociocultural level. These include the exclusion of women, youth and pastoralists; the limited involvement of monitoring organizations; interference by religious leaders (marabouts), inconsistent sectoral policies, and lack of synergy between projects and programmes.

Involving local communities in the identification of problems and in the planning, implementation and governance of sustainable land management must be the basis of all interventions aimed at reversing the process of land degradation in the Sahel. Equally crucial is awareness-raising among communities and strengthening their capacity through farmer-to-farmer exchange visits, farmer field schools, and specific training that promotes wide-scale adoption of best practices. Finally, supporting restoration through the development of agroforestry resource value chains helps to empower communities and sustain interventions.";"Sanogo, Diaminatou

"UNCCD:600000103";"Post-project impacts of restoring degraded land in Tahoua, Niger. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"When the IFAD-funded project started in 1988, few people could have imagined that 15 years later the degraded plateaus would be covered with trees on land restored to production by individual smallholder farmers. And no one imagined that a village on a barren degraded plateau would one day produce enough vegetables to meet its own needs and produce a surplus for sale, because water levels in the wells had risen so much. Furthermore, it was inconceivable at that time that restoring degraded land would lead to the emergence of a land market, with people buying degraded plots of land with the aim of restoring them.

Field visits between 2004 and 2019 showed that individual smallholder farmers have continued to use these introduced and adapted water harvesting techniques. Smallholder farmers who restored degraded land then developed new and resilient agroforestry systems and increased food production.
By doing so they have increased their resilience to climate change and many are now much better off than they were 30 years ago.

However, there is still a need and scope for further improvements. 
First, farmers would benefit from better access to good-quality seeds and to fertilizers. 
Second, the new agroforestry systems could have denser tree cover and contain a more diverse range of tree species. And third, improved rural roads would facilitate access to markets, which is important for villagers who are now producing surplus vegetables during the dry season.

The restoration of degraded land in Illéla District has transformed barren plateaus into productiveland. This is due to the insights and efforts of many individual farmers who decided that it was in their best interest to invest in these restoration techniques. There is now a great opportunity for follow-up interventions to further support the development of smallholder agriculture, and to replicate this positive experience in other regions and countries.";"Hassane, Abdou

"UNCCD:600000104";"Successful landscape restoration in Abreha We Atsbeha watershed, Tigray, Ethiopia. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";" Key success factors
There were several reasons for the success of the restoration initiative.
• Implementation had the active participation of the local community; i.e., it was community- led restoration.
• Restoration produced short- and long-term economic and environmental benefits.
• It systematically included women, girls and youth in restoration activities.
• The former village leader had the leadership capacity to mobilize the local community.
• The area has steep slopes producing runoff and sandy soils in the valleys with high rates of infiltration.
• The local people had the ability to change their attitudes/mind-sets from one of dependence to self-help.
• There was participatory development of locally agreed bylaws that support landscape restoration.

Conclusions
Abreha We Atsbeha watershed was one of the most degraded in Tigray. Soil erosion and water scarcity reduced agricultural production, and the community faced food shortages for many years. The government gave them two alternatives: resettle in another faraway region with higher production potential or restore the productive capacity of the degraded watershed. The local community thoroughly discussed the two options, and the village leader, Aba Hawi, managed to convince the local community to choose the second option. Once the local community opted to rehabilitate their degraded land they continuously invested their labour. As a result of this ongoing effort they succeeded in reversing land degradation. 

The restored productive capacity of the land — coupled with increased groundwater recharge — has significantly increased and diversified agricultural production. As a result, the local community has become food secure and also less poor, as the villagers don’t have to sell assets to generate money to buy cereals; instead they generate income from selling cash crops grown in the newly irrigated area. The youth in the village are also now able to generate income from the sale of vegetables from new irrigated plots, livestock fattening, dairy production, and beekeeping. Crucially, the participation of the youth in these income-generating activities has enabled most of them to remain in their village, rather than migrating to cities or abroad, as used to be so common.

The keys to successful landscape restoration from this example are the active participation and ownership of the local community in restoring degraded landscapes, leading to a change in their attitudes; and the leadership quality and communication skills of the village leader. The landscape restoration process must be inclusive in scope and practice, and must consider marginalized groups such as women, girls and youth. The current international attention being paid to drylands landscape restoration can be translated into further success when it better combines economic and environmental benefits for sustainability.";"Haile, Mitiku

"UNCCD:600000105";"History and impacts of dryland restoration in Yatenga, Burkina Faso. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"Since the mid-1980s, the positive impacts of these simple, cost-efficient water harvesting techniques become clear, following their increasingly widespread adoption. Their use has allowed smallholders to reverse land degradation, improve soil fertility, sustainably increase crop production, achieve food security, and create more productive, diverse and resilient farming systems. At the same time, groundwater is recharged, improving access to drinking water for the entire year, and creating opportunities for irrigated vegetable gardening around wells.

The people of Ranawa faced an existential crisis in 1984, but today they are less poor, better fed, better clothed, and better housed. Every family in the village now has the cash to invest in at least one mobile phone, indicating that they are also better connected. Would this transformation have been possible without their efforts to restore the productive capacity of their village lands?

The combination of planting pits and contour stone bunds has helped to effectively restore degraded land in the village of Ranawa and in many more villages in the northern part of Burkina Faso’s Central Plateau. How scalable are these techniques? The construction of contour stone bunds obviously requires the presence of stones close to the farmland. The zaï planting pits function well in conditions of 400–800 mm rainfall. Rainfall below 400 mm would require much bigger pits to hold more water and rainfall greater than 800 mm risks drowning the crops in the pits. Zaï pits have also been used to restore degraded land that is flat and has a hard crust.

As the construction of contour stone bunds and the digging of planting pits require an important investment in labour, they are usually found in areas with high population densities (30+ persons per km²). In 1989, 13 farmers from Illela district (Tahoua Region) in Niger visited Yatenga region, and on their return, began to experiment with planting pits. Thereafter, planting pits were widely adopted in that part of Niger (see case study in this issue: Post-project impacts of restoring degraded land in Tahoua, Niger). Planting pits and contour stone bunds are simple water harvesting techniques that do not require massive investment, and have the potential for scaling to other dryland areas across
the Sahel and the Horn of Africa where the conditions mentioned above are met.";"Belemviré, Adama

After moving to Kaijaido country in the south, I started an initiative to restore the land, increase food security and reduce poverty, supported by a grant from the East African Community with various activities supported by FAO and Yale University.

The local Maasai people are pastoral. They depend on pasture and browse trees for their livestock, but most land is now so degraded that this has led to hunger and hopelessness. I began by mobilizing the community and training them in the importance of land restoration. The aim was to foster relationships, learn by doing, and share and co-create knowledge on how to effectively and sustainably restore degraded land, in order to increase profitability and landscape and livelihood resilience.";"Gichiri, Beverly Mugure";"European Tropical Forest Research Network";"European Tropical Forest Research Network";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"drylands;food security;land restoration;smallholders;sustainable land management";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"011;KEN";"Reports & Research";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/600000106";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/106_looseleaf_in-Brief(i)-Mugure.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""
"UNCCD:600000107";"Two decades of farmer managed natural regeneration on the Seno plain, Mali. Included in Restoring African Drylands";"";"The adoption of FMNR increased by 50% over 20 years; about 90% of all farmers now encourage natural regeneration on the land that they manage. The key to success is having local institutions that are respected and effective. The experience in Bankass shows that reforestation rates of at least 250 trees per hectare can be achieved by farmer managed natural regeneration on Sahelian agricultural lands, recreating an agroforestry parkland at a fraction of the cost of establishing conventional plantations.

Lessons learned about FMNR and key factors for its success include the critical importance of effective local institutions and of their good working relationships with communes, community-based associations, government extension services, and NGOs.

The Barahogon traditional association was formally registered 20 years ago and has been promoting FMNR ever since. The strength of these traditional institutions is remarkable, given the constantly changing context, including the adoption of new legislation and regulations, the near-doubling of the sedentary population in the area, added pressure on access to land and natural resources, and increased security concerns.

The current situation in Mali has exacerbated intercommunity tensions, in particular between the Dogon (traditionally farmers) and Peulh (traditionally pastoralists) (Toulmin et al. 2020). Also, because one of the country’s jihadi leaders is Peulh, many people assume that all Peulh are jihadists, and there are accusations of extrajudicial killings by the military and of attacks by local militia from both sides.

Due to this deteriorating security, the management of natural resources is a lesser priority for local communities, whose lives and livelihoods face more immediate threats. Many people — both Dogon and Peulh — have fled the district, and some may never return. If local institutions are to continue to contribute to the management of natural resources, they will require backing from national and local authorities. This must be well financed over the long term, and supported by capacity building and training for their leaders.";"Allen, Mary

"UNCCD:600000114";"Life on land: Why it matters";"";"What’s the goal here?
To sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.
Two billion hectares of land on Earth are degraded, affecting some 3.2 billion people, driving species to extinction and intensifying climate change.

Goal 15: Life on land

Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resources. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and important sources for clean air and water, as well as being crucial for combating climate change.

Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately affecting poor communities.

While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants have been illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes biodiversity, but creates insecurity, fuels conflict, and feeds corruption.

Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage and support global food and water security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and peace and security.

Forests

    * Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood, including 70 million indigenous people.
    * Forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects.
    * Between 2010 and 2015, the world lost 3.3 million hectares of forest areas. Poor rural women depend on common pool resources and are especially affected by their depletion.
    * Currently, land degradation has reduced productivity in 23 per cent of the global terrestrial area, and between $235 billion and $577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk as a result of pollinator loss.

Desertification

    * Arable land loss is estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate
    * Due to drought and desertification, 12 million hectares are lost each year (23 hectares per minute). Within one year, 20 million tons of grain could have been grown.
    * 74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally.
    * Habitat loss and deterioration, largely caused by human actions, have reduced global terrestrial habitat integrity by 30 per cent relative to an unimpacted baseline.

Biodiversity

    * Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries.
    * Of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction.
    *  Of the over 80,000 tree species, less than 1 per cent have been studied for potential use.
    * Fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about 3 billion people. Only ten species provide about 30 per cent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50 per cent of aquaculture production.
   *  Over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants. Only three cereal crops – rice, maize and wheat – provide 60 per cent of energy intake.
    * As many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-­‐based medicines for basic healthcare.
   *  Micro-organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged.
    * While protected areas now cover 15 per cent of terrestrial and freshwater environments and 7 per cent of the marine realm, they only partly cover important sites for biodiversity and are not yet fully ecologically representative and effectively or equitably managed.

"UNCCD:600000117";"Health and Terrestrial Ecosystems";"";"Ecosystems and Biodiversity Facts and Figures

# The IPBES Report (5) stated that “around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, more than ever before in human history”. 
#  The Report also outlined that the average abundance of native species in most major landbased habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900; 
# more than 40% of amphibian species, almost 33% of reef-forming corals and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened; although the picture is less clear for insect species, available evidence supports a tentative estimate of 10% being threatened; and at least 680 vertebrate species had been driven to extinction since the 16th century and 
#  more than 9% of all domesticated breeds of mammals used for food and agriculture had become extinct by 2016, with at least 1000 more breeds still threatened.
# “Approximately 60% (15 out of 24) of the ecosystem services examined… are being degraded or used unsustainably” (1). 
#  The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, a 2019 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, noted a debilitating loss of soil biodiversity, forests, grasslands, coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds and genetic diversity in crop and livestock species (12).
#  Since 1993, the Red List Index has declined from 0.82 to 0.74 globally (4). The Red List Index measures changes in species extinction risk and includes more than 20 000 animal and plant species, showing an increasing risk as species decline. 
#  The State of the World’s Biodiversity report in February 2019 found that 63% of plants, 11% of birds and
5% of fish and fungi were in decline (12).
#  As of January 2018, on average, 44% of global key biodiversity areas (KBAs) for freshwater, 47% for terrestrial and 48% for mountain were covered by protected areas (4).
#  The 2014 Global Biodiversity Outlook projected that out of 53 target elements of the Aichi biodiversity targets within the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, only five were on track to be reached by 2020 (4).
#  For 200 million people, degrading coastal mangrove ecosystems weakens the protection of their livelihoods and food security from storm surges and rising sea levels (13).

Food production Facts and Figures

#  Production of food has severe impacts on global biodiversity, accounting for about 60% of terrestrial biodiversity loss (4).
#  About one third of soils is moderately to highly degraded; additionally, water extraction for agriculture and other uses, as well as pollution, threatens freshwater ecosystems (4).
#  Humans are dependent on just three crops – rice, wheat and maize – for nearly half of plant-based calories, and this lack of diversity makes us more vulnerable (14). 
#  Globally, three out of four crops producing fruits or seeds for human food use depend, at least in part, on pollinators, yet 40% of invertebrate pollinator species, particularly bees and butterflies, and 17% of vertebrate pollinators, such as bats and birds, are threatened with extinction (12,15).
#  Collated data from 91 countries show that many species that are indirectly involved in food production, such as birds that eat crop pests and mangrove trees that help to purify water, are less abundant than in the past (12).
#  Land degradation adversely affects around 3.2 billion people and threatens the livelihoods of over 1 billion people globally (16).
#  Approximately 20% of the earth’s vegetated surface has become less productive (12). Between 1998 and 2003, up to 2.4 billion hectares of land showed declining productivity, affecting 19% of cropland, 16% of forestland, 19% of grassland and 28% of rangeland (4). 
#  Globally, an estimated 2 billion hectares, equivalent to 17% of all biologically productive land, could benefit from restoration.
#  In 2016, the estimated number of undernourished people worldwide was 815 million; an increase from 777 million in 2015; although this is a reduction from the estimate of 900 million in 2000, this reversal of downward trend is observed most notably in situations of conflict combined with droughts, floods environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity (17).
#  Micronutrient malnutrition affects as many as 2 billion people, typically caused by a lack of access to food of sufficient variety and quality (13).
#  While net annual forest area loss was 7.3 million hectares in 2000, it fell to 3.3 million hectares in 2015. In 2015, forests covered about 4 billion hectares, 31% of the world’s land area (16). 
#  The most dramatic declines occur in Latin America, south-eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Human Health impacts Facts and figures
# Climate change is expected to lead to an increased frequency and severity of allergic diseases through increases in air pollution (both as a cause and a consequence of climate change), elevated groundlevel ozone concentration and extreme weather events such as thunderstorms and wildfires (19,21,22).
#  Climate change is exacerbating biodiversity loss and, in turn, many of the ecosystems affected, such as oceans and forests, are important carbon sinks (13).
#  In 2017, climate-related disasters caused acute food insecurity for approximately 39 million people across 23 countries (13).

At the same time, the process of decentralisation and establishment of new local government structures raise the question of which institutions should be responsible for land management. The last ten years have seen a growing body of experience with new approaches to land policy and interventions. The land tenure issue in much of Africa is characterised by the co-existence of different systems of regulation – governmental and traditional/local – which often overlap and contradict each other. Rural people rarely have access to formal legal procedures, due to large discrepancies or contradictions between legal texts and local realities, the complexity and cost of the procedures involved, lack of awareness of legal provisions, and so forth.

It is widely recognised that secure and equitable rights to land and natural resources are central to this effort.  Land rights empower people and provide a sense of dignity. They enhance food security and are fundamental to achieve the right to food and increase the productivity of small-scale food producers. They provide an incentive for ecosystem stewardship, and they promote inclusive and equitable societies whilst underpinning cultures and value systems. In most countries of the world, land rights make the difference for girls and women that need education, income and voice. It is estimated that non-marketed services derived from the use of land and natural resources make up 50-90% of the total source of livelihoods of rural households living in poverty world-wide.

Recent developments in FAO’s Gender and Land Rights Database";"";"Although there is global consensus that women’s land rights are fundamental for the realization of food security and rural development, accurate and reliable statistics to monitor the attainment and realisation of these rights are still lacking. Indeed, the lack of clear and accurate statistics on landownership and land management– that are disaggregated by sex - is problematic for developing clear policy responses to, and for monitoring of, inequalities faced by women and men in rural areas.
Women’s land rights are often discussed using indicators of agricultural holders and landowners interchangeably. The agricultural holder is the manager of the holding and is a useful concept for understanding issues of agricultural productivity and responsibilities in production. The landowner has legal claims to the land and typically has the right to sell, bequeath or mortgage the land. Both are important components of women’s land rights, but they are different and should not be confused with one another –rather they should complement each other to enhance our understanding of women’s rights to and control over land resources.

"UNCCD:733";"Who Owns the World’s Land? A global baseline of formally recognized indigenous and community land rights.";"";"In recent years, there has been growing attention and effort towards securing the formal, legal recognition of land rights for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Communities and Indigenous Peoples are estimated to hold as much as 65 percent of the world’s land area under customary systems, yet many governments formally recognize their rights to only a fraction of those lands. This gap—between what is held by communities and what is recognized by governments—is a major driver of conflict, disrupted investments, environmental degradation, climate change, and cultural extinction. While community land rights are garnering greater attention in national and international circles, the actual status and extent of legal recognition has not been well understood.
This report seeks to contribute to this field as the first analysis to quantify the amount of land formally recognized by national governments as owned or controlled by Indigenous Peoples and local communities around the world. The study includes data from 64 countries comprising 82 percent of global land area. It builds on the ongoing work of the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI) to track ownership and control of the world’s forests, and expands that research to identify lands that are owned and controlled by local communities across all terrestrial ecosystems in the countries studied, including such diverse lands as grasslands in China, taiga in northern Canada, and rainforests in Brazil.

"UNCCD:771";"Climate Benefits, Tenure Costs.The Economic Case For Securing Indigenous Land Rights in the Amazon";"";"A large number of countries recognize the role of forests in carbon sequestration and committed in their NDCs to protect forests, reduce deforestation rates, and restore forestlands. Few NDCs, however, make any specific commitments to how their forests will be protected or restored on degraded land. It is still unclear if governments will protect forests by expanding the protected estate, improving the management of existing national parks, helping communities safeguard the forests on their lands, or by taking other measures.
The research for this report was designed to help governments make these decisions. It examines the
environmental and economic arguments for one specific approach to protecting forests—securing
indigenous forestlands.
The research included original matching analysis to determine the effect of secure tenure on deforestation rates in indigenous lands in the Amazon forest in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia. Indigenous land covers at least 149 million hectares or almost 24 percent of the Amazon forest in these three countries. 
The analysis finds that the annual deforestation rates in the tenure-secure indigenous forestlands are significantly lower than on other similar lands in all three countries, suggesting that securing tenure contributes to reducing deforestation in these areas.";"Ding, Helen

"UNCCD:1317";"Rangelands: Making Rangelands More Secure in Cameroon: A Review of Good Practice";"";"Rangelands cover a surface area of more than 2 million hectares in Cameroon. Despite their relatively unpredictable climate and unproductive nature they provide a wide variety of goods and services including forage for livestock, habitat for wildlife, water and minerals, woody products, recreational services, nature conservation as well as acting as carbon sinks. Rangelands in Cameroon are predominantly grassland savanna with three types distinguishable: the Guinean savanna, Sudan savanna (also known as ‘derived montane grasslands’), and the Sahel savanna. They are home to the Fulani pastoralists and agro-pastoralists, sedentary farmers, as well as fishermen and hunters who depend on these rangelands for their livelihoods.

These different land users have interacted relatively peacefully over the centuries. However, in recent years this harmony has been threatened by both internal and external influences resulting in conflicts between them. The reasons for this are manifold. At the core of the conflicts however is the declining resource base for pastoralists occasioned by increasing human population, and changing land use patterns in favour of commercial agriculture, conservation and tourism as well as other economic interests such as infrastructure and energy development and mining. These conflicts do not only occur between pastoralists and farmers but also between pastoralists and fishermen, between pastoralists and conservationists and to an extent between pastoralists themselves.

A root cause of these conflicts is the lack of attention paid to rangelands, resulting in poor investment and support. In addition, there exists a dualism of tenure in the country with land access and management enabled through various laws (formal ordinances to by-laws to customary rules and regulations). Foremost amongst these are the Land Ordinance Laws No. 74/1 and 74/2, which classify land into three categories: state property, private property and national land. The law recognises private land rights only through possession of a land title. All untitled, unregistered land that is not designated as public land (i.e. not managed by the state on behalf of the public) is considered to be national land. In addition, Decree No. 78/263 establishes the terms and conditions for management of conflicts on agro-pastoral lands.

Institutionally, the above ordinances provide for two related bodies – the Land Consultative Board and the Agro-Pastoral Commission (APC), which administer national lands including grazing lands or rangelands. Presently, Cameroon is undertaking policy and legal reforms including one, a review of the land legislation, and two, the development of a Pastoral Code, which aims to harmonise the various laws, ordinances and customary tenures in pastoral areas including formal, customary and religious ones.";"Flintan, Fiona

"UNCCD:1548";"Measuring Individuals’ Rights to Land: An Integrated Approach to Data Collection for SDG Indicators 1.4.2 and 5.a.1";"";"Land is a key economic resource inextricably linked to access to, use of and control over other economic and productive resources. Recognition of this, and the increasing stress on land from the world’s growing population and changing climate, has driven demand for strengthening tenure security for all. This has created the need for a core set of land indicators that have national application and global comparability, which culminated in the inclusion of indicators 1.4.2 and 5.a.1 in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda. Having indicators on land ownership and rights in the SDG framework is an opportunity to routinely generate comparable, sex-disaggregated data to support evidence-based decision making on responsible land governance for sustainable development.

The custodians of SDG indicators 1.4.2 (UN-Habitat and the World Bank) and 5.a.1 (FAO) have joined forces to develop a standardized and succinct survey instrument designed to collect the essential data for computation of both indicators simultaneously. As the data collection requirements for each indicator largely overlap, great gains in efficiency are possible by implementing a joint module in existing survey questionnaires. This document aims to facilitate the successful, efficient, and cross-country comparable data collection for computation of SDG indicators 1.4.2 and 5.a.1 in line with the methodologies approved by the IAEG-SDGs. The survey instrument discussed in this document was designed with an eye for the integration of essential questions for both indicators into existing survey instruments, with the possibility of stand-alone implementation. Use of the proposed module encourages the standardization of indicator definitions and data comparability across countries and over time.

Agricultural markets and sustainable development: Global value chains, smallholder farmers and digital innovations";"";"The State of Agricultural Commodity Markets presents commodity market issues in an objective and accessible way to policy-makers, commodity market observers and stakeholders interested in agricultural commodity market developments and their impacts on countries at different levels of economic development.

This edition of The State of Agricultural Commodity Markets focuses on how markets can bring us closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SOCO 2020 offers a detailed analysis of the major global trends in agri-food markets and trade to identify how to reap economic, environmental and social gains and spur overall development. The report makes an important contribution to the debate on how well-functioning markets can contribute to inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. SOCO 2020 discusses policies, innovative mechanisms and digital innovations that can promote the participation of developing countries and smallholder farmers in global value chains. The report also looks at policy responses to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food value chains, both nationally and globally.

Sustainability standards are gaining importance in global markets, especially for high-value products with established links to global value chains. Growing consumer demand for sustainability certified products has resulted in increases in the share of agricultural land under sustainability certification. About one-quarter of the global coffee and cocoa areas are certified through sustainability standards developedby non-governmental organizations and the private sector. The market providesinformation in terms of prices. Harnessing the market mechanism to also provide information on how food is produced and on the benefits this brings to the environment and society, can address the trade-offs between economic, social and environmental objectives.

Agriculture is one of the main economic occupations in the world. In essence, more than 600 million farms provide income and employment for billions of people, while producing food and raw materials for a growing and increasingly affluent population.
About 90 percent of these farms are estimated to rely predominantly on family labour, occupying 70–80 percent of global farmland and producing about 80 percent of the world’s food in value terms. Most of these family labour farms are small – about 70 percent of the 600 million farms worldwide are equal to or smaller than one hectare and operate 7 percent of total agricultural land.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agriculture;food security;land classification;land rights;land use;smallholders";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1591";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1591_fao_commodity_markets_2020_CB0665EN.pdf";"";"";"";"164";"";""
"UNCCD:1669";"On Equal Ground: Promising Practices for Realizing Women’s Rights in Collectively Held Lands";"";"Sustainable land governance requires that all members of a community, both women and men, have equal rights and say in decisions that affect their collectively-held lands. Unfortunately, women around the world have less land ownership and weaker land rights than men – but this can change, and this report shows ways how that can be done. The reports serves as a valuable guide to realizing more gender-equitable collective land tenure systems by detailing case studies from five communities around the world showing promising approaches to securing equal tenure rights for women and the conditions that enabled these communities to do so. When women have rights and a seat at the table, outcomes such as increased livelihoods and income, improved forest cover, restored land, improved biodiversity are more likely.

Key findings
    Equal and secure land rights for women are integral to attaining global development outcomes and a more gender-equitable and sustainable world.
    In collectively held lands, women have secure tenure when collective land tenure is legally recognized and enforceable, and women can claim and exercise rights equally with men, including the right to use and benefit from the lands and resources and participate in their governance.
    Laws devolving control over common resources to local communities, when they mandate gender-inclusion, pave the way for women to gain tenure rights where previously they had secondary or no rights.
    Women’s participation in communal land and resource governance is a key aspect of tenure security; where their participation is nascent or weak, women should be supported through capacity-building activities and by sensitizing men to the benefit of gender-inclusive decision-making.
    While there is no one-size-fits-all formula applicable to different contexts, universally, interventions to secure women’s land tenure must be carried out at multiple levels and in an interlinked manner, targeting both the structural framework that ensures that women have rights and the operational environment that creates the conditions for women to be able to realize rights.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes equal and secure land rights for women as integral to attaining the global goals of ending poverty and hunger and realizing a more gender-equitable world. To achieve these goals, policies and investments to secure women’s land rights must target not only their individual rights (or jointly with spouses) to household land but also their group-based rights in collectively held lands and resources, such as forests and rangelands.

This report seeks to advance women’s tenure rights in collectively held lands by documenting promising practices and approaches gleaned from communities where women have recognized and secure rights. World Resources Institute (WRI) partnered with Resource Equity and organizations in five countries to identify and conduct case studies of five communities that have relatively gender-equitable land tenure systems.

WRI, RE, and the in-country partners investigated the extent and strength of women’s tenure rights in the five communities and drew out the main factors or conditions that enabled women to claim and exercise rights. We examined the extent of tenure rights according to three dimensions of tenure security:

    Robustness, which includes legitimacy or the recognition of rights in both formal and customary systems and the enforceability of rights against third parties;
    Completeness or the scope of rights held, including the right to access, use, and derive benefits from lands and resources, as well as participation in their governance; and
    Durability or the length and certainty of rights.

WRI and RE then synthesized the findings to glean major enabling factors for realizing women’s tenure security, which prove to be two sets of factors:

    Structural factors, or factors that ensure that women have rights
    Operational factors, or factors that create the environment for women to claim and exercise rights

"UNCCD:1672";"Forest tenure pathways to gender equality: A practitioner’s guide.";"";" This practitioner’s guide explains how to promote gender-responsive forest tenure reform in community-based forest regimes. It is aimed at those taking up this challenge in developing countries. There is no one single approach to reforming forest tenure practices for achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment. Rather, it involves taking advantage of opportunities that emerge in various institutional arenas such as policy and law-making and implementation, government administration, customary or community-based tenure governance, or forest restoration at the landscape scale.

This sourcebook provides multiple forms of guidance from: conceptual ideas, operational direction, good practices, case-study insights, research findings and resources for further exploration from across Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is designed to support a wide range of practitioners, women and men, from a range of institutions such as government offices, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, donor agencies, women’s organizations, as well as networks and federations. This includes gender experts who are responsible for the integration of gender equality and women’s empowerment in their respective organizations, and also those working broadly in the world of land tenure, forest tenure and governance, forest landscape restoration, agroforestry, value-chain development and social impact enterprises.

The goal is to journey along the pathways to forest tenure reform through a three-step process: Analyze, Strategize and Realize. Focused diagnostic analysis to create an empirical foundation for change can support the design of sequential interventions to promote gender-responsive forest tenure reform at various scales. To this end, the guide is a timely resource to support high-impact interventions suited to accelerating change within the national and local context in community-based forest tenure regimes.

"UNCCD:1675";"Women success stories from South East Europe";"";"Women’s economic empowerment is essential in promoting equality between women and men and is a precondition for sustainable development.

To promote economic empowerment of rural women through the support of women entrepreneurship, it is crucial that women are informed about property rights, in particular in relation to agriculture businesses.
This collection of success stories from women from South East Europe will help to raise awareness of all women about their property rights and to amplify women’s voices and role in the rural economy.
The stories focus on women with issues in land property rights and on women’s entrepreneurship with farm or non-farm small businesses.
 
Although women’s land rights are vital to development, in practice these rights are often unequally shared between men and women, routinely set aside, denied, or given insufficient protection and enforcement. Women have less access to land than men and are often restricted to so-called ‘secondary land rights’, meaning that they hold land rights only via male family members.

Women thus risk losing entitlements in the case of divorce, widowhood or their husband’s migration. Clear ownership rights allow for these rights to be transferred via the sale or lease of land, and loans can be granted on capital markets as land can be used as collateral security.

The obstacles that prevent women from effectively enjoying these rights are complex. They range from inadequate legal frameworks and poor implementation, to patriarchal practices and religious precepts.

In regards to access to investments and subsidies, and thus to new income generating opportunities, women in rural areas are disproportionately disadvantaged due to a lack of property (agricultural land or real estate), insufficient education and a lack of adequate information and specific advisory services.

Besides education and training, it is therefore important to inform women in rural areas about their property rights, to share best practices and success stories that showcase how women establish and sustain entrepreneurship.

"UNCCD:200000424";"Interview. Balms for the world’s desertified lands. Landscape News spoke with UNCCD Executive Secretary at the World Day to Combat Desertification";"";"According to the U.N. and World Bank, 40 percent of the global population is affected by water scarcity, and by 2030, up to 700 million people could be displaced as a result.
Having spent his youth spent living through a series of droughts and famine, Ibrahim Thiaw is not only a face to these numbers but also on a mission, as Executive Secretary of the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), to ensure that even if the statistics are forgotten, the lands and lives they involve are not. 

The UNCCD is extremely active on the issue of migration because of the links between degradation and migration. When there is nothing left for a young person to do, what else can they do but flee? But the UNCCD has a large program in Africa supporting dozens of countries, called the 3S Initiative (Sustainability, Stability and Security), which is a program targeting young people, creating opportunities to help them stay home rather than take the dangerous roads of irregular migration, or helping those who have not been successful in migrating come back home and be reintegrated. So it’s a wonderful program supported by many countries,
spearheaded by Morocco and Senegal.

We do have many other programs including supporting the Great Green Wall in the Sahara, which is also creating opportunities and jobs for young people, women and people who are unfortunately left behind. It is important for us all to take into consideration that when there is no production in rural areas, people have to flee somewhere else, and that situation can be very difficult. It can create civil unrest. These young people might also be implicated in terrorist attacks. With USD 200, it’s a lot of money for them, and they can be diverted to situations where no one wanted them to be.

Land rights also make sure that small farmers own their land, and there is no land and water grabbing. People come to grab water more than land because they have land where they live, but what may be lacking there is water, or productive land.

Land tenure is extremely important and equally important for investors. If you are thinking about restoring 2 billion hectares in the world, to create the balance we need in the world, these investments will have to be done by private companies that would normally exploit the land for a longer period of time. Who is going to invest in someone else’s land if there is no land security, if there is no concession, if there are no guarantees that these investments will yield and be there for a long period of time?";"Thiaw, Ibrahim";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2019-12-31";"en";"land rights;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;migration";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/200000424";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/424_Article_Balms_for_world_desertified_lands_Ibrahim_Thiaw.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""
"UNCCD:200000426";"Interview.  Over 2 billion people impacted by land degradation";"";" Between 1981 and 2003, nearly a quarter of global land got degraded, says UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw.
The great Roman Empire collapsed because of, among other things, the desertification caused by deforestation and land degradation. Today, 169 countries in the world face the impact of land degradation. In the 25th year of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), a progeny of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, New Delhi will be hosting the 14th edition of its Conference of the Parties (CoP-14) from September 2 to September 13. In an interview held in Ankara, Turkey, UNCCD’s Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw explained the significance of the Delhi conference and also outlined the Convention’s strategies to stall the progress of man-made deserts. (These are only excerpts from the interview)

How do you view the upcoming Delhi conference?

It is going to be the most successful CoP so far. Top leaders of many countries are attending. Close to 200 countries are sending their representatives and there will be around 5,000 delegates. This is a global conference focussing on land restoration agenda, which is so vital for achieving the global Sustainable Development Goals and climate resilience. 

Desertification is a natural phenomenon, isn’t it?

By desertification, we do not mean the natural expansion of existing deserts in the world. When we say desertification, we mean the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas.

Why is combating desertification so important? Can degradation of land be reversed?

Restoration of the health of the degraded land in drylands is important because about 34% of the earth’s land surface and half of the farmlands are in these drylands. Over 2,000 million people live there, in addition to more than half of the world’s livestock. Most of the dryland residents are poor and water shortage is acute. Child mortality rate is very high. Poverty is both a cause and consequence of desertification.
 Does climate change have a role in desertification?What are the effects of desertification on people?What are some of the ways in which UNCCD help countries fight desertification?What are your expectations from the Delhi conference?You seem to favour private investment in the land restoration effort?This idea will be controversial in India where privatisation of public assets is taboo.";"Thiaw, Ibrahim

It reduces their vulnerability to hunger and poverty; influences their capacity to invest in their productive activities and in the sustainable management
of their resources; enhances their prospects for better livelihoods; and helps them develop more equitable relations with the rest of their society, thus contributing to justice, peace and sustainable development.In this policy, land refers to farmland, wetlands, pastures and forests. Land tenure refers to rules and norms and institutions that govern how, when and where people access land or are excluded from such access. 
Land tenure security refers to enforceable claims on land, with the level of enforcement ranging from national laws to local village rules, which again are supported by national regulatory frameworks. It refers to people’s
recognized ability to control and manage land – using it and disposing of its products as well as engaging in such transactions as the transferring or leasing of land. The focus on land does not mean that the inherent linkages to other natural resources, especially water, are ignored. Rather, the aim is to ensure a policy, institutional and operational focus that would otherwise be diluted if the scope were broadened to the larger issues of access to natural resources, and of governance and management.";"";"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2008-12-31";"en";"land tenure systems;rural areas";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/731";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/731_Land_ Access_Rural_ Communities.pdf";"";"";"";"44";"";""
"UNCCD:477";"Land rights under pressure: Access to resources in Southern Benin";"";"The aim of this paper is to analyse the institutional arrangements for gaining access to land and natural resources in southern Benin. This study analyses these practices in two zones, the Allada region and the coastal zone around the city of Ouidah, each of which has particular conditions of access to land. It considers the link between certain trends (demography, the development of markets, the reduction in cultivable land, technical constraints, etc.) and new institutional arrangements, their impact on agricultural productivity, and how practices affect equity and security of tenure.In the study areas, local rules governing access to and control over land are derived from two types of land tenure system. The first belongs to a system commonly found in communities where village institutions regulate land, religion, lineage and the chieftaincy. Under this system, the strength of lineage rights over land tenure depends on how long the group has been settled in the village. The second, more specific, regime is structured around a system involving “landlords” (who can allocate land to others) and their “clients” (the descendants of former slaves). The land tenure relationships between the descendants of slaves in the hamlets of Dekouenou and large land-holding families with estates around Ouidah fall into this second category. In the first case, we talk about a “community based” system, while the second consists of a land tenure system with its roots in slave-based societies from earlier centuries. Both forms of tenure share the same general principles: the rights of the first occupant are pre-eminent, land and resources are allocated for multiple uses, and there are several levels at which land rights are regulated.";"Edja, Honorat";"";"International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2001-12-31";"en";"land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"BEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/477";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/477_9011IIED.pdf";"";"";"";"29";"";""

However, as the study progressed over time, it was realized that what we initially interpreted as soil fertility management strategies were closely intertwined with wider issues such as cropping systems, livelihood aspirations and land tenure relations. Exploration of farmers’ soil fertility management practices revealed a link between tenure insecurity among migrant farmers especially, and limited attention for regeneration of soil fertility. The native farmers who own land tend to use rotations involving long-duration crops such as cassava and pigeonpea to improve their soils. In contrast, migrants who depend mostly on short-term rental or sharecropping arrangements, rely more on rotations with shortduration
crops such as cowpea and groundnut to improve soil fertility.";"Nsiah, Samuel Adjei";"";"Wageningen University & Research";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2006-12-31";"en";"land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"GHA";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/484";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/484_116565.pdf";"";"";"";"224";"";""

"UNCCD:927";"Land Degradation Assessment in Small Island Developing States (SIDS)";"";"Sustainable management of the natural resource base is a fundamental issue to support global environmental benefits provided by ecosystem services, and to ensure agricultural production and ultimately food security and livelihoods. Assessing Land degradation is a major component of effective sustainable land management particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

Land Degradation is considered to be “…any form of deterioration of the natural potential of land that affects ecosystems integrity, either in terms of reducing its sustainable ecological sustainability or in terms of reducing its biological richness and maintenance of its resilience” (GEF, 2003). Globally it affects over 100 countries on all continents with Antarctica being the only exception (Springer, 2006).  SIDS are generally characterized by high levels of chronic poverty, largely ruralbased populations and heavy dependence on traditional agriculture and with specific reference to the Caribbean region, tourism based economies. In each instance land degradation has devastating effects on these countries such as significant structural constraints for economic growth, human development and environmental sustainability.  

At the same time, SIDS, possess unique characteristics, that further exacerbates the problems associated with land degradation, given the small size of the countries (in terms of both physical area and economy), limited infrastructure, distance from large international markets, high vulnerability to natural disasters low level of human resource development and increasing urbanization. 

Small size, combined with, diverse soil types, topography, climatic variation, lack or in some cases archaic and poor land use policies limits the area available for urban settlement, agriculture, mining, commercial forestry, tourism and other infrastructure, and creates intense competition between land use options. 
It is estimated that of the 400 ha of degraded land in SIDS worldwide, 120 ha occur in the Caribbean region and 30 percent of the reefs in the Caribbean are at risk (UNEP/GEO). In SIDS of the Caribbean, Land degradation has increased in the last 30 years related in some way to the following factors:

• Economic: market forces, trade agreements, structural adjustments, national economic and land use policies, land tenure policies etc.
• Social: urbanisation, immigration, population dynamics and growth, cultural changes etc.
• Environmental: rainfall variability, water quality and quantity, access to water etc";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2017-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/927";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/927_a-i7744e.pdf";"";"";"";"134";"";""
"UNCCD:1315";"Rangelands: Conservation and “Land Grabbing” in Rangelands: Part of the Problem or Part of the Solution?";"";"Large-scale land acquisitions have increased in scale and pace due to changes in commodity markets, agricultural investment strategies, land prices, and a range of other policy and market forces. The areas most affected are the global “commons” – lands that local people traditionally use collectively — including much of the world’s forests, wetlands, and rangelands. In some cases land acquisition occurs with environmental objectives in sight – including the setting aside of land as protected areas for biodiversity conservation. On the other hand, current trends and patterns of commercial land acquisition present a major and growing threat not just to local livelihoods and human rights, but also to conservation objectives. There is a potential opportunity here for greater collaboration between conservation interests, and local communities’ land rights interests with their supporters amongst human rights and social justice movements. This Issue Paper documents experiences from the rangelands of Mongolia, Kenya, India, Ethiopia, and other countries, which were presented at a Conference on Conservation and Land Grabbing held in London in 2013.

Rangelands are a target for investment, including for mining and large-scale crop production, across the world. The land allocated to commercial investors is usually considered empty or under-used. In Mongolia between 2000 and 2010, 0.3 million hectares of pastureland were provided to mining companies, and another 10 million hectares were placed under limited access while mining exploration took place. At the end of 2012, almost 3% of the country was under licence for mining exploitation, and another 10.4% was under mining exploration. Land tenure in such areas is usually customary and communal, and often unprotected legally. Many states neither legally recognise unregistered customary land rights nor provide opportunities for land users to obtain legal property rights over group-held land.

The “global land rush” is also challenging biodiversity conservation efforts. There was a wave of downgrading, downsizing, or degazetting of protected areas between 1960 and 2010, and in particular in the past 15 years. In addition, over 2,000 proposals in 24 countries are currently in place, totalling nearly 1 million sq km; the majority of these are in industrialised countries, such as the USA and Australia. Recent examples from Kenya, Ethiopia, Mongolia, and India all highlight areas of high biodiversity lost to commercial agriculture (sugar, biofuels, grain crops) and to mineral extraction. Many of these losses are from within existing state-protected areas. In India from 2002 to 2011 the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) granted permission for the diversion of 400,687 hectares of forest land to other land uses. Diversion to mining and power projects accounted for 38% of this loss. In Ethiopia, more specifically Gambella and South Omo, the national conservation authority managed to negotiate key biodiversity areas back from investment concessions, once their high conservation value was proved.";"Flintan, Fiona";"";"International Land Coalition";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2014-12-31";"en";"land acquisitions;land rights;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;land use;rangelands";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"ETH;IND;KEN;MNG";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1315";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1315_ICL_Rangelands_5.pdf";"";"";"";"41";"";""
"UNCCD:1316";"Rangelands: Pastoralists Do Plan! Community-Led Land Use Planning in the Pastoral Areas of Ethiopia";"";"The Government of Ethiopia and more specifically, the Rural Land Administration and Use Directorate, (RLAUD) has identified land use planning as an important tool for the sustainable development of the country. Land use planning is vital for optimising the use of the land and for reconciling conflicts between different land uses. Land use planning should be carried out at different levels – from national to regional to local including community: these different levels should support and integrate with each other. 

Pastoral areas cover around 60% of the country – mainly found in lowland arid and semi-arid parts. These areas are dominated by livestock production, but are increasingly seeing other land uses creeping in. Though in the past, customary institutions have managed to govern the land well to prevent land use conflicts and to protect the environment, they have found this increasingly challenging as their authority has been challenged, problems have become more complex, population has increased, and competition for land and resources has grown.

With this in mind, the Government of Ethiopia has developed a process of participatory land use planning, currently being piloted in two pastoral areas of the country. This process builds on the pastoral planning that is already undertaken by local communities, as part of good land management and decision making processes. In order to fully understand this pastoral planning the RLAUD and the International Land Coalition Rangelands Initiative supported a study to review how pastoralists plan in five different pastoral areas of the country. This Issue Paper documents this review, highlighting some of the intricacies of the planning processes, related governance structures, and the challenges and opportunities faced by pastoral communities. It is anticipated that this Issue Paper will guide other planning processes, in the same way that it has guided the development of the government-led participatory land use planning process in Ethiopia.";"Flintan, Fiona

"UNCCD:1318";"Rangelands: Improving the Implementation of Land Policy and Legislation in Pastoral Areas of Tanzania: Experiences of Joint Village Land Use Agreements and Planning";"";"Resilience-building planning in drylands requires a participatory, integrated approach that incorporates issues of scale (often large scale) and the interconnectedness of dryland ecological and social systems. In an often political environment that supports small, “manageable” administrative units and the decentralisation of power and resources to them, planning at large scale is particularly challenging; development agents in particular may find it difficult to work across administrative boundaries and/or collaboratively.

In Tanzania, the Village Land Act No. 5 of 1999 (VLA) and the Land Use Planning Act No. 6 of 2007 (LUP Act) guide planning at the local level. The VLA (sections 12 and 13) grants power to Village Councils (VCs) and their institutions to prepare participatory village land use plans (VLUPs). The LUP Act (sections 18, 22, 33, and 35) provides for the formation of planning authorities, functions, and procedures of developing participatory VLUPs and approval processes, and grants power to VCs to prepare those plans.

The Tanzania National Land Use Planning Commission’s Guidelines for Village Land Use Planning, Administration and Management (the NLUPC Guidelines – April 2013 revised version) detail six main steps to follow when developing participatory VLUPs. Despite this guidance, limited resources mean that village land use planning rarely gets beyond Step 4 of six, and support for the actual implementation of plans is lacking or extremely limited.

Village land use planning in rangelands faces particular challenges. Lands held by individual villages are generally not sufficient to sustain rangeland production systems such as pastoralism, and so demand a sharing of resources across village boundaries. There is low awareness on land use planning amongst district governments and communities, and conflicts over boundaries are common. Conventional land use planning tends to limit the mobility of pastoralists and others such as hunter-gatherers, whereas the semi-arid and arid environment of these areas demands that this mobility is retained.";"Kalenzi, Deus";"";"International Land Coalition";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2016-12-31";"en";"land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;land use;pastoralists;rangelands;resilience";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"TZA";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1318";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1318_ICL_Rangelands_7.pdf";"";"";"";"67";"";""

At the beginning of each module, reference is made to the relevant provisions in the Guidelines. The  guide  focuses  on  equity  and  on  how  land  tenure  can  be  governed  in  ways  that  address  the  different  needs  and  priorities  of  women and men. It moves away from long-standing debates about gender  equality  in  access  to  land,  towards  the  mainstreaming  of  gender issues to achieve more gender-equitable participation in the processes  and  institutions  that  underlie  all  decision-making  about  land.Gender   equality   is   one   of   the   ten   core  principles  for  implementation  of  the  Guidelines  and  is  closely  tied  to  three   others   –   human   dignity,   non-discrimination,  and  equity  and  justice  (Box 1).

This  guide  focuses  on  gender-equitable  governance  of  land  tenure;  it  therefore  does  not  embrace  the  full  scope  of  the  Guidelines,  which  also  cover  governance  of  tenure  of  fisheries  and  forests.  However,  the  broad  principles  of  gender-equitable  participation to governance processes are applicable to fisheries and forests as well (particularly  as  these  interface  with  land)  and  interesting  lessons  can  be  drawn  for  wider use. The  guide  provides  advice  on  mechanisms,  strategies  and  actions  that  can  be  adopted to improve gender equity in the processes, institutions and activities of land tenure  governance.  It  does  not  include  an  in-depth  discussion  of  all  the  outcomes  of  these  processes  and  institutions,  but  provides  useful  recommendations  as  basic  guidance.

On  11  May  2012,  the  Committee  on  World  Food  Security  endorsed  the  Voluntary Guidelines  on  the  Responsible Governance  of  Tenure  of  Land,  Fisheries  and  Forests  in  the  Context  of  National  Food  Security  (the  Guidelines).  Based  on  the  principles  of  sustainable  development  and  in  recognition  of  land’s  centrality  to  development,  these Guidelines are intended to contribute to global and national efforts towards the eradication of hunger and poverty by promoting secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests.This   technical   guide   on  Governing land   for   women   and   men   aims   to   assist   implementation   of   the   Guidelines’   principle   of   gender   equality   through   the   achievement of responsible gender-equitable governance of land tenure.

To help identify good practice for responsible gender-equitable governance of land tenure,  a  technical  workshop  was  held  in  May  2011  at  FAO  Headquarters  in  Rome.  “Governing Land for Women and Men – a Workshop on Gender-Equitable Governance of   Land   Tenure”   brought   together   land   sector   practitioners   from   government,   civil  society  and  the  private  sector  around  the  world  to  share  practical,  hands-on  experiences and approaches to improving gender equity in land tenure governance. The outcomes of this workshop have contributed immensely to enriching this guide.

During a high-level session at the close of the UNCCD COP 14 (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Conference of the Parties) in September, a declaration to focus on land-based solutions to combat climate change was adopted. In the declaration, the relevance of the VGGT was reaffirmed for better access, control and stewardship over land and equitable tenure security. It encourages parties to use the principles laid out in the VGGT in the implementation of activities to combat desertification/land degradation and drought.  In closing the session Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, emphasized that the key message to the upcoming UN climate summit in New York was clear, “investing in land, unlocks multiple opportunities.”

FAO was invited to produce a technical guide on integrating the VGGT into the implementation of the Convention and land degradation neutrality, taking into account national contexts for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its fifteenth session.

As  tenure  systems  increasingly  face  stress,  with  growing  populations  requiring  food  security  and  with  environmental  degradation  and climate change reducing the availability of land and forests, the governance of tenure becomes ever more crucial in determining whether and how people are able to acquire rights to use and control these lands and forests, along with the associated responsibilities.

Recognizing   increasing   demands   for   help   in   addressing   this   challenge,   in   particular from local-level stakeholders, FAO initiated a multistakeholder process that culminated in May 2012 with the Committee on World Food Security endorsing the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (‘the Guidelines’). Based on principles of sustainable development and the fundamental role of land in people’s livelihoods and environmental resilience, the Guidelines are intended to contribute to global and national efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty by promoting secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests.Inspired  by  the  Guidelines,  and  recognizing  forest  tenure  as  a  key  part  of  the  challenge,  this  Practical  Guide  on  improving  governance  of  forest  tenure  is  for  you  if  you  want  to  rise  to  that  challenge.

It encourages parties to use the principles laid out in the VGGT in the implementation of activities to combat desertification/land degradation and drought.  In closing the session Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, emphasized that the key message to the upcoming UN climate summit in New York was clear, “investing in land, unlocks multiple opportunities.”

FAO was invited to produce a technical guide on integrating the VGGT into the implementation of the Convention and land degradation neutrality, taking into account national contexts for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its fifteenth session.

"UNCCD:1412";"First Continental Report on the Implementation of Agenda 2063";"";"The implementation of Agenda 2063 has gathered momentum at all levels. The continent has made some remarkable
progress towards attaining the goals defined in Agenda 2063’s First Ten-Year Implementation Plan as outlined in this
report.

The Executive Council at the 32nd Ordinary Session in January 2018 approved the Monitoring and Evaluation
Framework and Indicator Handbook, referenced in the Executive Council Decision 987 (XXXII). The Specialised
Technical Committee on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration at its Ministerial Meeting in
March 2019 recommended that AUC and AUDA-NEPAD take the lead in coordinating the preparation and submission
to policy organs of biennial performance continental reports on Agenda 2063.

Accordingly, AUDA-NEPAD and AUC developed an evidence-based methodology to guide AU Member States and
Regional Economic Communities to prepare empirical progress reports on the implementation of Agenda 2063. The
methodology embodies a set of tools and templates for data entry, analysis and standardised reporting based on the
goals and targets stipulated in the Agenda 2063 First Ten-Year Implementation Plan. Furthermore, a dashboard on the
performance against the goals, strategic priority areas enhances ease of assessment of progress made, as a basis for
review, dialogue and decision-making among stakeholders.
Subsequently, AUC and AUDA-NEPAD provided technical support to Member States and Regional Economic
Communities to prepare progress reports on Agenda 2063.

This is the first continental-level report that has been compiled from reports received from 31 African Union Member
States, covering 56% of the continent, and six Regional Economic Communities. The report presents an analysis of
the aggregate status of progress made against the targets stipulated in the First Ten- Year Implementation Plan, taking
into consideration that the continental plan has so-far been implemented over six years.

The continent’s efforts to pursue women empowerment through ensuring equal economic opportunities among
men and women - including ownership or securing rights over agriculture land, registered a low score of 20% against the 2019 target. However, some countries exhibited good practices. For example, in Lesotho, the conversion of land tenure from customary to registered leases created opportunities for women to secure land.
Before the Land Act 2010, 73% of leases were registered to men only, but with the advent of the Act, women now
hold 34% of the leases while joint registration by men and women stands at 25%.";"";"African Union;New Partnership for Africa's Development";"New Partnership for Africa's Development";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;sustainable development;women";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"002";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1412";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1412_Agenda 2063 Implementation Report_EN_web version.pdf";"";"";"";"109";"";""
"UNCCD:1431";"Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century: Gearing extractive industries towards sustainable
development.";"";"Resources, including minerals and metals, underpin the world’s economies for almost all sectors, providing crucial raw materials for their industrial processes. Despite efforts to decouple economies from resource use towards a circular economy, demand for extractive resources will continue to grow on the back of emerging economies. The report maps existing international governance frameworks and initiatives which have overlapping subsets that focus on delivering the 2030 Global Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In this report, the International Resource Panel (IRP) of the UN Environment Programme highlights that the mining sector, if carefully managed, presents enormous opportunities for advancing sustainable development, particularly in low-income countries.

As discussed in Chapter 5, extractive industries place large demands on natural resources such as land and water. Its activities can lead to polluting water resources, biodiversity loss and ecosystem destruction including land degradation and desertification. Therefore, there is a need to look at the dynamic relationships between mining, and land and water. This calls for a systems-thinking approach that accounts for the nexus between resources so as to steer policy efforts towards integrated natural resource management along the mining value chain.

The report maps existing international governance frameworks and initiatives which have overlapping subsets that focus on delivering the 2030 Global Agenda for Sustainable Development. It presents the practical actions required to improve the international governance architecture for mining to enhance its contribution towards sustainable development. It calls for a new governance framework for the extractive sector referred to as the “Sustainable Development Licence to Operate” which includes consensus-based principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy commitments.

Minerals and metals underpin national economies, provide crucial raw materials for industrial activities, and are inputs to almost every sector of the global economy. Demand for extractive resources will continue to grow on the back of emerging economies with expanding and increasingly affluent and urban populations and a global transition towards low-carbon but metal-intensive energy production technologies. This is despite efforts to decouple economies from resource use and towards greater recycling.

The frequently severe and enduring environmental impacts of mining highlight the need to carefully balance such activities with stewardship of other valuable natural resources and the environment including ecosystems and biodiversity, and the rights of local people and communities.

Decision-making in the extractive sector is shaped by a complex array of governance frameworks and initiatives operating along highly globalized mineral value chains. There is an urgent need to coordinate and reform this governance landscape to address enduring challenges such as commodity price volatility, lack of linkages between mining and other economic sectors, inadequate management of environmental impact, and socio- and geopolitical risks of mining.

The report maps over 80 existing international governance frameworks and initiatives which focus on delivering overlapping subsets of the 2030 Global Agenda for Sustainable Development, but do not currently operate in a sufficiently coordinated or integrated manner.

In this context, the report calls for a new governance framework for the extractive sector referred to as the “Sustainable Development Licence to Operate” and includes consensusbased principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy commitments.

The report discusses practical actions to improve the international governance architecture for mining to enhance its contribution towards sustainable development. The proposals include reaching an international consensus regarding the normative content and structure of the Sustainable Development Licence to Operate informed by expert inputs from a “Highlevel Panel on Mining for Sustainable Development”. It further considers the creation of an International Mineral Agency to share relevant information and data. Governments could also reach bilateral and plurilateral agreements regarding security of supply of raw materials and resource-driven development. Periodical reporting of progress towards sustainable development could be enabled through a Global “State of the Extractive Sector” review or
equivalent process.";"";"United Nations Environment Programme";"United Nations Environment Programme";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"extractive industries;land governance;land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems;natural resources;natural resources management";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1431";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1431_extractive_industries.pdf";"";"";"";"374";"";""
"UNCCD:1457";"2020 Global Food Policy Report: Building Inclusive Food Systems";"";"FOOD SYSTEMS ARE EVOLVING QUICKLY TO MEET GROWING AND CHANGING DEMAND, BUT THEY ARE NOT SERVING EVERYONE’S NEEDS. As we modernize food systems to make them climate-smart, healthy, and sustainable, we must also strive to make them inclusive of smallholders, youth, women, conflict-affected people, and other poor and marginalized people. IFPRI’s flagship report examines the obstacles and opportunities for inclusion, looks at the growing range of tools and technologies that can enhance inclusiveness, and considers the key role that food system policies can play in making food systems work for everyone. Drawing on recent findings, IFPRI researchers and other distinguished food policy experts consider critical aspects of building inclusive food systems: 
•	How can inclusive food systems help break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition? 
•	What can be done to strengthen the midstream of food value chains—transporters, distributors, processors, and retailers—to give smallholders and rural people better access to markets and services? 
•	Will Africa’s food systems generate sufficient jobs for the region’s rapidly growing youth population? 
•	How can women be empowered within food system processes, such as household decision-making, negotiations with market actors, research decisions, and policymaking? 

•	Can conflict-affected people and refugees be integrated into food systems—either in their new homes or the places they fled—to help them rebuild their lives? 
•	How can national food system transformations contribute to improvements in dietary diversity, food safety, and food quality for all? 
•	What major trends will affect food security, nutrition, and inclusion of disadvantaged peoples across the globe in 2020?

	The 2020 Global Food Policy Report also presents interesting trends revealed by several key food policy indicators, including country-level data on agricultural spending and research investment, productivity in agriculture, and projections for future agricultural production and consumption.

The 2020 Global Food Policy Report focuses on the need to build inclusive food systems, both to ensure that marginalized and vulnerable people enjoy the benefits and opportunities that food systems can bring and to support sustainable development. Inclusive food systems can help create better economic opportunities for poor people, mitigate climate change impacts for the most vulnerable, and spark innovation for the production and consumption of healthy foods. 

When this report went to print, the coronavirus outbreak posed a new threat. As the world battles this pandemic and as economies and livelihoods are disrupted, the poor and vulnerable are likely to suffer the most. Addressing the impacts of this shock—from supply chain and trade interruptions to severe unemployment to rising poverty levels—urgently requires effective, targeted social protection for the most vulnerable in the short term. For long term resilience, we must build inclusive food systems. This ninth annual report examines who is excluded in today’s food systems and how to improve the terms on which individuals and groups participate so that everyone can reap their benefits.";"";"International Food Policy Research Institute";"International Food Policy Research Institute";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"land tenure;land tenure;land tenure systems";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"002;015;142;145;419";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1457";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1457_food_policy_report_2020.pdf";"";"";"";"110";"";""
"UNCCD:1461";"Reversing Land Degradation in Drylands: The Case for Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) in the Upper West Region of Ghana.";"";"The Lawra district of the Upper West region was selected as the case study. This study compared crop yields for FMNR and non-FMNR farmers. FMNR farmers are classified as having at least 8 trees per acre, with an average of 13 trees per acre (33 per ha) and a maximum of 40. Non-FMNR farmers are classified as having between 1 and 7 trees per acre, with an average of 5.Qualitative  (focus  group  discussion)  and  quantitative  (household survey) data were collected in April to May 2019.  Over  500  households  were  interviewed  in  both  CIKOD intervention communities and control sites. Data from the survey were used to undertake production function analysis and assess the contribution of farm inputs and farming practices on crop yields.

Key findings
1. Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) constitutes a long-term investment in soil quality.FMNR and crop rotations enable farmers to increase the productivity of their cropland by at least 83 per cent within five years. As tree density increases so does crop yields.

2. FMNR communities are considerably more food secure and climate resilient.In qualitative terms, focus groups discussions showed that FMNR farmers are more food secure relative to non-FMNR farmers since they can harvest a wide range of on-farm forest products (fruits, nuts and pods) during the lean season when they otherwise would face food shortages. The average present value of enhanced forest produce (ebony fruits, shea nuts, dawadawa, mango and fuel wood) and crop yields as a result of adopting FMNR and crop rotations is in the order of GHS 255per acre per year (EUR 102 per hectare per year).

3. FMNR creates co-benefits by addressing multiple problems simultaneously.These problems include land degradation, food insecurity, fuel wood, and timber and fodder shortages. By combining FMNR with other Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices, agricultural yields can be further improved. Moreover, well-conceived FMNR projects facili-tate good governance, greater collaboration and community cohesion. Significant obstacles to up-scaling remain however, ranging from insufficient fire management, low and poor availability of rural credit, contradictory policy incentives and the absence of strong land and tree tenure. NGOs, the private sector and govern-ment agencies, can address different aspects and help create an enabling environment for farmers to practice FMNR. 

See also recommendations: 
For landusers❚ Invest in FMNR for long term diversified returns;❚ Intercrop with legumes, make use of crop rotations, compost, mulching and tied ridges for higher agricul-tural productivity;❚ Other SLM activities can be adopted to build the long-term health of soils.

For NGOs, international development partners and lending institutions❚ Empower community leaders to prevent fire and man-age fire, the very basis for FMNR;
❚ Empower farmers to monitor and track changes to help improve access to investment capital and man-age their farming enterprises better;❚ Help  improve  farmers’  access  to  rural  credit  and  critical farming equipment for FMNR and SLM (e.g. smaller tractors, wheel barrows, cutlasses, welling-ton boots and protective gear).

For public decision-makers❚ Focus on promoting FMNR to meet international com-mitments;❚ Integrate  agriculture  and  evergreen  farming  into  school curriculums;❚ Manage bush fires and encourage cooperation between the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Forestry Commission in extension service provisioning;❚ Improve land and tree tenure and farmers collateral; ❚ Use economic incentives to promote FMNR;❚ Develop  more  inclusive  agricultural  programmes  that target smallholders and could be restructured to support this group. ❚ Improving farmers’ access to capital and equipment. For example, farmers need access to water to make high quality compost. According to Banuoko (2019), financial support for equipment and assets such as donkey charts and wheel barrows, or labour to help with the digging of water holes closer to the fields would have a considerable impact.

About: Regreening Africa Project . Reversing Land Degradation in Africa through Scaling-up EverGreen Agriculture. 
The Project started in 2017, and aims to improve livelihoods, food security and climate change resilience by restoring ecosystem services.
The project target countries are Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Somalia.
The action is financed by the European Commission and co-financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and is carried out jointly by the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF).

ICRAF supports target countries in setting up analytic tools and efficient surveillance measures on land degradation dynamics. Resulting information will pave the way for deliberate and strategic decision-making around land management.
Moreover, in a consortium with NGOs, evergreen agriculture approaches like farmer-based natural regeneration and regreening measures by smallholder farmers are scaled up, along with the development of agroforestry related value chains.

The ELD Initiative raises awareness on the threats and opportunities of different land use options by supporting and communicating cost-benefit analyses in each target country. At the same time, the Initiative extends the capacity of national experts to assess the economic benefits of investments in sustainable land management in consideration of the costs of land degradation.
Based on these assessments, decision-makers and administrators will have access to scientific information on the economic consequences of land degradation and optional pathways to rural growth.";"Westerberg, Vanja

"UNCCD:1609";"Sand and Dust Storms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region: Sources, Costs, and Solutions";"";"Dust storms are capable of transporting sediment over thousands of kilometers, but due to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s proximity to the Sahara Desert, the region is one of the dustiest in the world. While natural sources such as the Sahara are the main contributors to dust storms in MENA, land-use changes and human-induced climate change has added anthropogenic sources as well. 

Like sources, drivers of sand and dust storms are also natural and anthropogenic, as both wind speed and land management can cause them. Dust deposition has wide-ranging health impacts, such as causing and aggravating asthma, bronchitis, respiratory diseases, and infections and lung cancer. Apart from devastating health impacts, dust also impacts the environment, agriculture, transport, and infrastructure. Globally, welfare losses from dust are approximately 3.6 trillion USD, where costs are about 150 billion USD and over 2.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on average in MENA. 

Besides investing in early warning systems, governments all over the world are designing policies to mitigate the impact of sand and dust storms, both at national and regional levels. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) launched a sand and dust storm warning system that aims to deliver reliable dust storm forecasts through a network of research organizations all over the world. It aims to improve the ability of countries to deliver quick and high-quality sand and dust storm forecasts and knowledge to users through an international partnership of research and operational organizations.

Dust storms are capable of  transporting sediment over thousands of  kilome-ters, but due to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s proximity to the Sahara Desert, the region is one of  the dustiest in the world. Dust storms are transboundary, which has important implications for their mitigation, as effects are felt in different countries and even regions than their source of  origin. North African dust is trans-ported to as far away as the Amazon Forest, North America, Europe, and China. The Sahara Desert is undoubtedly the biggest dust source, as its dust emissions are about four times as much as Arabian deserts. North Africa, the Middle East, South West Asia, and North East Asia are the regions with the highest dust frequencies and highest Aerosol Index (AI) values. The highest density of  dust sources in the Middle East is found in northern Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and along the Syria-Iraq border. Dust sources in the region are also generally found in areas with extensive desert cover, low population densities, and sparse agriculture concentrated along river valleys. 

In terms of  occurrences of  dust storms, Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the Persian Gulf  report the greatest number of  dust storms overall.While  natural  sources  such  as  the  Sahara  are  the  main  contributors  to  dust  storms  in  MENA,  land-use  changes  and  human-induced  climate  change  has  added  anthropogenic  sources  as  well.  There  are  about  three  times  as  many  natural  dust  sources  as  anthropogenic  dust  sources,  however  due  to  land  use  changes  in  the  past  few  decades, anthropogenic sources have increased. Most North African dust storms originate from natural sources such as the Sahara, but there are some anthropogenic sources too. For instance, Southern Sahel, the Atlas Mountains, and the Mediterranean coast sources are overwhelmingly anthropogenic. The Middle East region also experiences dust storms from a mix of  natural and anthropogenic sources.

Natural resources laws are influenced by developments in the international arena, either through international treaties that are binding or through ‘soft law’ instruments that are not legally binding but nevertheless have widespread adherence among governments, or that provide principles that guide and shape national legislation. National legislation is also influenced by the political, social, economic, environmental, cultural and historical landscape in the country, as well as needs and priorities that are specific to that country.

•Smallholder farmers lack sufficient land or economic incentives to invest in agriculture.
•The above issues create a ‘wicked problem’ – a conundrum for future food security.

National food security in countries of sub-Saharan Africa requires an abundant supply of cheap and nutritious food for the burgeoning population. At the same time agriculture is a major contributor to the balance of payments for African economies. So agricultural production in Africa needs to increase strongly to meet the demands of both national and international markets. Yet fragmentation of land due to population pressure in rural areas, and the low prices farmers are paid for their produce, mean that in many rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa the farms are already too small to provide food security or a living income for the household. There is a high dependency on off-farm income and little incentive to intensify production. Thus rural households are often ‘reluctant’ farmers, lacking resources or the economic incentives to invest in agriculture. The conundrum that must be addressed is how to provide cheap, nutritious food to feed the growing urban and rural populations while creating incentives to stimulate increased agricultural production.

In the last decade, demand for EU bioenergy has risen significantly, largely driven by political targets and subsidies. Our calculations show that the total land footprint related to EU bioenergy is likely to expand from 44.5 Mha (an area of the size of Sweden) in 2010 to 70.2 Mha (an area of the size of Poland and Sweden combined) in 2030.

EU demand forecasts for bioenergy towards 2020 and 2030. This required land area, the so-called global land footprint, includes both domestic land and land related to imports of bioenergy feedstock and end-products.

"UNCCD:904";"Bioenergy, Land Use Change and Climate Change Mitigation.  Background Technical Report";"";"The report addresses a much debated issue – bioenergy and associated land use change, and how the climate change mitigation from use of bioenergy can be influenced by greenhouse gas emissions arising from land use change. The purpose of this background report is to supply a more detailed, fully referenced version for practitioners, and researchers, in support of the short version (IEA Bioenergy: ExCo:2010:03) which was aimed at policy advisors and policy makers.

The sustainable use of bioenergy presents a major opportunity to address climate change by reducing fossil 
carbon dioxide emissions. Practically all bioenergy systems deliver large greenhouse gas savings if they replace  fossil-based energy causing high greenhouse gas emissions and if the bioenergy production emissions – including  those arising due to land use change – are kept low.
Bioenergy projects can lead to both direct and indirect land use change. The effects of indirect land use change are especially difficult to quantify and achieving a consensus on the extent of the impact is unlikely in the near  future. Even so, it can be concluded that land use change can affect greenhouse gas balances in several ways,  with both beneficial and undesirable consequences from bioenergy’s contribution to climate change mitigation. 
However, bioenergy does not always entail land use change. The use of post-consumer organic residues and  by-products from the agricultural and forest industries does not cause land use change if these materials are  wastes, i.e. not utilised for alternative purposes.
Food, fibre and bioenergy crops can be grown in intergrated production systems, mitigating displacement effects  and improving the productive use of land. Lignocellulosic feedstocks for bioenergy can decrease the pressure on prime cropping land. The targeting of marginal and degraded lands can mitigate land use change associated with bioenergy expansion and also enhance carbon sequestration in soils and biomass. Stimulation of increased productivity in all forms of land use reduces the land use change pressure.
Bioenergy’s contribution to climate change mitigation needs to reflect a balance between near-term targets 
and the long-term objective to hold the increase in global temperature below 2ºC (Copenhagen Accord). While emissions from land use change can be significant in some circumstances, the simple notion of land use change emissions is not sufficient reason to exclude bioenergy from the list of worthwhile technologies for climate change mitigation. Sound bioenergy development requires simple and transparent criteria that can be applied in a robust and predictable way. Policy measures implemented to minimise the negative impacts of land use change should be based on a holistic perspective recognising the multiple drivers and effects of land use change.";"Berndes, Göran

Producing beef emits 20 times more greenhouse gases than common plant-based proteins, which is why shifting diets toward containing less beef, and more plants, is an important climate action. To help food service companies support diners in choosing more plant-rich meals, this playbook from WRI’s Better Buying Lab outlines the top 23 ‘behavior change’ strategies drawing on cutting edge academic research into how people choose food, as well as insights from experts in the food service industry about what works and what doesn’t. 

The playbook is designed to be used by anyone working in the food service sector wishing to make changes within their operations to encourage diners to choose more sustainable, plant-rich options -- including chefs, food servers, managers, sales people, marketing and communications professionals, food operators, distributors, researchers, nutritionists, dieticians, and procurement teams.

Per gram of protein, beef production requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
than producing plant-based proteins like beans, peas, and lentils. As the global population grows to 10 billion people by
2050, 56 percent more crop calories will be needed to meet demand.

"UNCCD:1361";"Incorporating Land Use Impacts on Biodiversity into Life Cycle Assessment for the Apparel Industry";"";"Inputs of land for raw material production and fabric manufacturing. Such land use has significant implications for biodiversity—the diversity of Earth’s species, which provide critical services such as pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. 

Although land use is a major driver of biodiversity loss, there is no easily applicable method for incorporating land use impacts on biodiversity into life cycle assessment (LCA)—a widelyused tool for evaluating potential environmental impacts of a product system.

The characterization factors used in this study are based on the spatial classification ecoregion, a large area with distinct species and environmental conditions. Ecoregions provide more ecologically-relevant characterization factors than those calculated at larger spatial scales. For all 867 ecoregions, de Baan et al. provide a characterization factor for every combination of 4 broad land use types (agriculture, pasture, managed forest, and urban) and 5 taxa (birds, mammals, reptiles, plants, and amphibians). We used aggregated characterization factors, which are a weighted average of the taxon-specific characterization factors. 

Raw material production contributes more than 99% of the total biodiversity impact and land occupation for the cotton and wool t-shirts, and 92% of the lyocell t-shirt. These textiles require agriculture- and pasture-based land use, which have significantly  lower  yields,  and  thus  require  more  land  per functional unit, than the urban manufacturing processes.";"Egorova, Elena

"UNCCD:1369";"Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy";"";"Nature loss is a planetary emergency. Humanity has already wiped out 83% of wild mammals and half of all plants and severely altered three-quarters of ice-free land and two-thirds of marine environments. One million species are at risk of extinction in the coming decades – a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years.

The World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risks Report ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humanity will face in the next ten years. Human societies and economies rely on biodiversity in fundamental ways. Our research shows that $44 trillion of economic value generation – over half the world’s total GDP – is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Nature loss matters for most businesses – through impacts on operations, supply chains, and markets.

Despite an increasing focus on nature loss, there is still a limited understanding of why it matters to businesses and what the private sector can practically do about it. The World Economic Forum is launching a series of New Nature Economy (NNE) reports in 2020, making the business and economic case for safeguarding nature. The series aims to catalyse public-private momentum in 2020, with a focus on the UN Convention on Biological Diversity’s milestone summit (COP15) in Kunming, China, and the related Business for Nature mobilization.

Nature Risk Rising, produced in collaboration with PwC and the first report in the NNE series, explains how nature-related risks matter to business, why they must be urgently mainstreamed into risk management strategies and why it is vital to prioritize the protection of nature’s assets and services within the broader global economic growth agenda.

The series will span three reports that focus on the following priorities:
1.Make the case for why the nature crisis is crucial to business and the economy, including:
–The scale and urgency of the nature crisis
–The potential consequences for society if the crisis goes unchecked
–The interests of business to make the crisis a critical consideration
2.Identify a set of priority socioeconomic systems for transformation:
–Target areas in which individual and collective action from business and other actors (such as state-owned enterprises, investors and financial corporations) is urgent and indispensable
–Ecosystems that are closer to irreversible tipping points, and hence have more global relevance if tipped, and in which the drivers of degradation are more deeply connected to economic and business activities. Actors in this space therefore have more value at stake and a greater ability to influence the transformation.
3.Scope the market and investment opportunities for nature-based solutions to environmental challenges:
–Research solutions across the biodiversity, climate mitigation, climate resilience and ocean agendas
–Assess their economic and nature-building potential
–Identify areas and approaches that are most interesting for private-sector finance to engage in

Land degradation is affecting 3.2 billion people, and for far too long this has gone under the radar. This must change in 2020. If not, we risk that all the world’s topsoil be eroded in the next 60 years.

Healthy soil is a resource of incredible magnitude. It captures and stores water and carbon, increases biodiversity, and it preserves and increases food security.

The only way we can improve soil health is by really understanding human impact on nature and working with the farmer.

"UNCCD:1432";"Droughts in the Anthropocene";"";"This publication was produced as part of the digital interactive exhibition Droughts in the Anthropocene, prepared for the fortieth session of the UNESCO General Conference. Droughts in the Anthropocene features fifteen case studies from around the world showcasing the social, environmental and cultural impacts of droughts and water scarcity. It highlights solutions offered by collaboration between scientists and local communities, and the important work of UNESCO IHP and partners in bridging science with society and policymakers to better address the impact of droughts. The publication is multilingual and available in English/French and English/Spanish. 

Droughts are slow-onset natural hazards that can last from a few months to decades and affect anything from small watersheds to hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. In addition to their direct impacts on water resources, agriculture and ecosystems, droughts are potential catalysts for fires, heatwaves and invasive incursions, thereby creating multi-hazard environments and furthering the impact on and vulnerability of ecosystems and societies. Though droughts are natural events, there is an increasing understanding of how humans have amplified their severity and worsened their effects on both the environment and human populations. Humans have altered both meteorological droughts through human-induced climate change and hydrological droughts through management of water movement and processes within a landscape, such as by diverting rivers or changing land use. In the Anthropocene (the ongoing period in which humans are the dominant influence on climate and the environment), droughts are closely entwined with human actions, cultures and responses.

Droughts affect economies (causing economic damage in the range of tens of billions of US$ each year) as well as ecosystems and societies, particularly in arid and subtropical regions and in developing countries. Between 1995 and 2015, drought-related natural disasters affected 1.1 billion people and caused about 22,000 fatalities [1]. Women and girls are typically the hardest affected by drought due to gender inequalities, unequal power distribution and limited control over resources, making them even more vulnerable to drought impacts.

Addressing water scarcity in transboundary basins is a complex challenge: climate change and human influences put pressure on freshwater supplies, while lakes and rivers that cross international borders require coordinated interventions that take into consideration the basin as a whole. Droughts in the Anthropocene will therefore require us to take new approaches and share knowledge to find sustainable solutions. To mitigate the effects of droughts, we must increase human and institutional capacity, provide access to relevant early warning information that supports decision-making and completes the ‘last mile’ in communication and response, identify vulnerable communities and integrate these components into proactive drought management policies

"UNCCD:1513";"Evicted by Climate Change: Confronting the Gendered Impacts of Climate-induced Displacement";"";"In  a  world  in  which  poverty  is  increasingly  concentrated  in  vulnerable or fragile states, and fragility is increasingly driven by climate change, climate-induced displacement has become one  of  the  most  visible  manifestations  of  the  relationship  between  ecological  and  societal  breakdown.  Newest  figures  from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reveal that over 70% of the 33 million newly displaced people (2019) had climate-related  triggers.  Poor  and  marginalised  people  are  being  driven  from  their  homes  with  greater  frequency  and  in greater numbers as they are struck by storms, heat waves, floods, rising sea levels and other threats caused and exacer-bated by climate change.

The   impacts   of   recent   climate   disasters   in   developing   countries  that  are  also  enduring  COVID-19,  such  as  Vanuatu,  Fiji,  Bangladesh,  the  Philippines  and  India,  have  revealed  the  harsh reality that people experience. Not only did these events cause displacement, they also brought harm to people already on  the  move,  like  refugees  in  Cox’s  Bazar  in  Bangladesh,  or  migrant workers in India.This  injustice  is  further  compounded  for  women  and  girls,  particularly in developing countries. Systemic gender inequal-ities in leadership and decision-making limits their access to resources and inhibits their ability to withstand the impacts of climate  change,  to  access  basic  services  and  to  recover  from  climate-related disasters.The impact of the climate crisis on people’s lives, experiences and  material  conditions  differ  based  on  their  gender  and  sexuality. Our activities in response can increase and reinforce, or reduce, existing inequalities. Integrating gender into every stage of a response is therefore a core part of CARE’s work.This   report   outlines   the   causes   and   consequences   of   climate-induced displacement, and how the triple injustice of climate  change,  poverty  and  gender  inequality  must  be  met  by  transformative  action:  to  support  more  gender-equal  and  resilient  communities  in  sustainable  environments.  In  this  report,  CARE  draws  on  key  scientific  findings  as  well  as  its  own experience and, most importantly, the experiences of the people  CARE  seeks  to  support  in  managing  compound  risks:  women and girls in vulnerable situations.

Climate change can lead to land degradation, even with the implementation of measures intended to avoid, reduce, or reverse the degradation. In some situations, exceeding the limits of adaptation can trigger escalating losses or result in  undesirable  transformational  changes,  such  as  forced  migration, conflicts, or poverty.";"";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"climate change;land degradation;land use;migration;women";"Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1513";"https://careclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CARE-Climate-Migration-Report-v0.4.pdf";"";"";"";"32";"";""
"UNCCD:1587";"Addressing Food Loss and Waste: A Global Problem with Local Solutions";"";"Investments that reduce food loss and waste can deliver big wins on two pressing issues of our time: food security and environmental sustainability, according to a new World Bank report. But the results are not automatic -- countries need well-targeted solutions.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted domestic supply chains, causing some farmers to destroy unsold crops, about a third of all food produced annually was lost at the farming, transport and processing stages or wasted at the retail and consumer levels. A new World Bank report and four country case studies analyze why food loss and waste has been difficult for countries to manage and propose country-specific and even commodity-specific solutions.

""Strategies to reduce food loss and waste can deliver multiple benefits,"" *said Juergen Voegele, World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development. *""Together with other policies and investments, these strategies can play a major part in helping countries improve the health of their people, economies and environment.""

By adopting the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, countries committed to help halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses, by 2030 (Sustainable Development Goal 12.3). But progress has been patchy at best. Authors of *Addressing Food Loss and Waste: A Global Problem with Local Solutions *argue that trade-offs between food affordability, rural livelihoods, and sustainable use of natural resources can only be avoided if they are first identified and then addressed with clear policy priorities in mind.

When food is grown only to be discarded, precious natural resources are used and unnecessary pollution is generated. Greenhouse gas emissions arise from the process of growing food that is not consumed and from decomposing organic matter. Emissions related to food loss and waste account for an estimated 8% of total global emissions, making progress in this area a promising avenue for mitigating climate change.

Reducing food loss and waste can also improve food security. While keeping food prices artificially low to address food insecurity is a common approach by governments in low- and middle-income countries, this comes at a cost as low prices do not reflect the true environmental costs of producing food and create disincentives for conserving resources. Reducing food loss and waste can increase the supply of food and therefore make it more affordable for consumers without increasing production and further stressing natural resources.

""Policy priorities and the specific circumstances of each country should guide the focus on different stages of the supply chain,"" said Geeta Sethi, Advisor, Agriculture and Food Global Practice, World Bank and main author of the study. ""Countries need good data and analysis to choose the right policy instruments and make sound investments.""

Complementing the main study are four case studies that examine food loss and waste challenges and opportunities for Guatemala, Nigeria, Rwanda and Vietnam. Those diagnostics form the basis of targeted policy recommendations. For example:

    Improving weather and market information reaching farmers is one way to reduce food loss and waste in Rwanda, where farmers often overplant to hedge against risks and uncertainty, leading to crop losses at the moment of harvest.
    Improving food safety would allow Vietnam to produce more and better food from dwindling natural resources, reduce the health impact of unsafe food on its citizens, and increase its compliance with import-export standards so that food is less frequently rejected.
    In Guatemala, investments in storage systems at the farm or cooperative levels could greatly reduce losses and generate more sales from poor subsistence farmers and therefore higher incomes, making a dent on rural poverty and hunger.
    Addressing transportation constraints along a busy North-South corridor in Nigeria could greatly reduce food loss and waste, ensuring that more food reaches the burgeoning population in the South.

"UNCCD:1598";"IPBES Workshop on Biodiversity and Pandemics";"";"Land use change is a major global  driver of pandemic risk. Land usechange is a significant driver of the transmission  and emergence of infectious diseases 40,177-179. Land use changeis cited as the cause of over 30% of emerging infectious diseases,  and correlates significantly withthe emergence of novel zoonoses  globally 13,180. However, the mechanisms by which diseases  emergeare context-specific and scale-dependent. Land use change leads tothe loss, turnover and homogenization  of biodiversity181-183; it causes habitat fragmentation, creates novel ecosystems and promotes the expansion of human populations  into landscapes where Indigenous  Peoples and local communities have often lived since historical times at relatively low density.These activities create newopportunities  for contact between humans and livestock with wildlife, increasing the risk of disease  transmission and the emergence of pathogens34,59,60,184. Land use changehas been linked to outbreaksofEIDs, includingEbola 67andLassa fever 185in Africa, Machupo virus in South America186, zoonotic malaria in Borneo 129, malaria in Brazil 128and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China 9. 

Wildlife hosts of human pathogens occur at higherlevels of speciesrichness and abundance in areas with secondary forest, agricultural and urban ecosystems compared to undisturbed areas, with the strongest effects found in bats, rodents and passerine birds40,42. Human dominated habitats  favour the invasion and expansion of rodents that are reservoirs for plague, Bartonellaspp. bacteria, hantaviruses  and other zoonotic pathogens 41,187-190. Populations of reservoirs forHantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome have increased following deforestation in the Americas191and at regional and landscape levels in Central America192. Similarly, land use change is linked to increased transmission  of vector-borne diseases (albeit some of which are not pandemic threats) such as Dengue fever(with increasing urbanization), Chagasdisease 193,yellow fever, leishmaniasis194,195, Brazilian spotted fever 196-198and malaria 128,199.Even the legacy of anthropogenic disturbance can serve as a mechanistic driver of emergence by altering habitat and community structurein ways that shift disease dynamics in wildlife creating novel scenarios for pathogens to jump from wildlife to people.

Pandemics,such as COVID-19,underscore both the indivisible  interconnectedness of the world communityand the rising threat posed by global inequality to the health, wellbeing and security of all people: Exponential growthin consumption of products from land use change and globalized  trade, oftendriven by developed countries,have led to the repeated emergence of diseases from developingcountrieswith highbiodiversity, and thus conditions that increase potential  for zoonotic emergence.

Reducing high pandemic-risk consumption in developed countries:Unsustainableconsumption of palm oil, sugar cane, tropical forest hardwood, rare earth elements for electronic equipment, meat and other livestock products, wildlife products (e.g. fur for the fashion industry)and wild animals for the pet trade,all play a role in driving land use change and the wildlife trade, and increasing pandemic risk. More sustainable  consumption indevelopedcountries could be promoted by better labellingof products, and campaigns to raise awareness of the connections between consumption and emerging disease risk, biodiversity loss,  and climate change.

Long term studies of how changing land use patterns in conservation programs affect host-microbe species assemblages,  and transmission  among species and into humans and livestockmay provide vital knowledge that could be used to better assess  the impact of corridors, mosaic landscapes, andother conservation tools on health.It will be critical to conduct studies at multiple scales, relevant to the transmission  dynamics, ecological changes and behaviors and activities that drive emergence, as well as the scales targeted by conservation and restoration programs.
Enabling transformative change in the types of consumption, globalized  agricultural expansion andtrade that have led to pandemics: Unsustainable  patterns of global consumption drive globalized  agricultural expansion and trade, and are linked to pandemic risk, as well as land use change, biodiversity loss and climatechange. Increasing available knowledge on the economic benefits of more sustainable  consumption and agricultural development could be used to drive an added incentive in a shift to agriculture that focuses on provisioning  of ecosystem services, while responding to the needs of food security for local communities and encouraging human, animal and ecosystem health. Developing a better understanding  of the specific links between consumption patterns in developed and developing countries; demand for meat, products of mining and expansion of agriculture in EIDhotspots; and the risk of disease  emergence, could drive transformative change to reduce pandemics. 

Efforts could include:•Identifying, ranking and labelling  high pandemic risk consumption patterns  to provide incentives for alternatives•Designingcertification programs for low-pandemic risk consumption, e.g. programs to label products that reduce dependency on land use change from agriculture to re-established  natural ecosystems•Steps to increase efficiencyof agricultural processes, while balancing with sustainability, to meet food requirements from currently available land and subsequently  reduced land areas•Promotinga transition  to healthier and more sustainable  and diverse diets, including responsible  meat consumption.•Promoting food security to reduce the ad hoc consumption of wildlife•Where there is a clear link to high pandemic risk, consideration of taxes or levies on meat consumption, production, livestock production or other forms of consumption, as proposed previously by the USAInstitute  of Medicine Committee , UK Royal Institute of International  Development , academic reports and others .These activities will need to balance the commitments of developingcountriesfor economic development, the nutritional requirements for Indigenous  Peoples and local communities that depend on natural food sources, the need to maintain, restore, or sustainably use biodiversity and the need to protect global  health by reducing pandemic risk.

"UNCCD:200000404";"Identifying hotspots in land use land cover change and the drivers in a semi-arid region of India";"";"The study examines long-term land use/land cover change (LUCC) at a finer scale in a semi-arid region of India. The objectives were to study and quantify the spatiotemporal LUCC and uncover the major drivers causing the change in the Mula Pravara river basin, which is located in a semi-arid region of Maharashtra state, India. 

Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 3g data for the years 1982–2015 were used to identify the ‘hotspot’ with significant positive and negative LUCC. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery was used to produce finer scale land use maps. From 1991 to 2016, the agricultural land area increased by approximately 98% due to the conversion of uncultivable and fallow lands to agriculture. 

The built-up area increased by 195%, and in recent years, an urban expansion has occurred in agricultural lands close to the urban fringe areas. There has been a shift from food crops to commercial crops, as observed from the steep increase in the amount of land under horticultural plantations, by 1601% from 2001 to 2016. In addition, the area under forest canopy was reduced in the protected regions. Institutional factors that improved access to water resources were the major drivers of change in hotspots, especially in the context of agriculture. Technological and economic factors were the other supporting factors that contributed to the change. 

This study demonstrates the advantages of using satellite remote sensing techniques to monitor the LUCC, which is useful for predicting future land changes and aids in planning adaptation strategies.

Groundwater is considered as an open access/common pool resource, and it played a major role in the agricultural growth in the region. However, groundwater is not an infinite resource, and it has its own limitations in terms of recharge potential. For example, in the present study region, the local geology consisting of hard rock basalt severely limits groundwater availability and recharge potential. 

Groundwater over-exploitation and mismanagement is a common characteristic across all the semi-arid regions in India.

The built-up area increased by 195% from 1991 to 2016. In recent times, more of the agricultural lands in the fringe areas of urban centers have been converted into built-up areas. This unplanned growth and the expansion of urban centers are causes for concern, which puts pressure on the land and water resources in the peri-urban regions. 

Future climate risks in terms of dry spells, rainfall variability, and increases in the frequency of drought incidences further aggravate the vulnerability of the communities in the region.";"Duraisamy, V.

"UNCCD:752";"Unlocking the sustainable potential of land resources: Evaluation systems, strategies and tools";"";"Land resources are one of nature’s most precious gifts. They feed us and help our societies and economies to thrive. Land resources are one of nature’s most precious gifts. They feed us and help our societies and economies to thrive. Some 2.5 billion agricultural smallholders worldwide manage around 500 million small farms, providing more than 80 per cent of food consumed in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. These resources are being degraded at an alarming pace. An estimated 33 per cent of soil is moderately to highly degraded due to erosion, nutrient depletion, acidification, salinization, compaction and chemical pollution. Each year we lose 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil and 15 billion trees, costing the economy around $40 billion. 
The current report focuses on land potential evaluation systems as a critical foundation for land use planning and management. More specifically, land potential evaluation systems are needed to sustain and increase the provision of ecosystem services in the context of climate change, persistent land degradation and increasing global population and per-capita consumption levels by (a) guiding land tenure and land redistribution, and (b) promoting innovation to sustainably increase productivity and resource efficiency, including through sustainable intensification. Moreover, they can increase knowledge of locally-utilized food varieties already adapted to specific land environments.
The application of land evaluation to land use planning and management is limited by four factors. The
first is a lack of understanding of how to select and apply appropriate, currently available tools. The
second is that existing land potential evaluation tools fail to account for resilience. The third is that they
emphasize limits to production based on current technologies while ignoring and, in some cases, even
constraining the development of innovative management systems that could increase land potential
through an increase in resource productivity. Finally, and most importantly, socioeconomic and cultural
constraints to land use and management must be addressed after or at the same time as the biophysical
land evaluation. These constraints include, but are not limited to, land tenure, transportation and storage
infrastructure, markets, and dietary preferences.";"Herrick, Jeffrey";"United Nations Environment Programme";"United Nations Environment Programme";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2016-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land use planning";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/752";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/752_Unlocking_the_sustainable_potential_land_resources_2016.pdf";"";"";"";"96";"";""
"UNCCD:823";"Global Land Outlook";"";"Land is an essential building block of civilization yet its contribution to our quality of life is perceived and valued in starkly different and often incompatible ways. Conflicts about land use are intensifying in many countries. The world has reached a point where we must reconcile these differences and rethink the way in which we use and manage the land.

The evidence presented in this first edition of the Global Land Outlook demonstrates that informed and responsible decision-making, along with simple changes in our everyday lives, can if widely adopted help to reverse the current worrying trends in the state of our land resources.

An outlook is a vantage point, a platform, a perspective; it broadens our vistas and allows us to examine our prospects, both present and future. It is within this broader frame of thinking that the Global Land Outlook (GLO) aims to present a unique perspective on one of the Earth’s most precious assets: land.

"UNCCD:957";"Governance of land use in OECD countries. Policy analysis and recommendations.";"";"How land is used affects a wide range of outcomes – from day-to-day quality of life, such as the length of commutes, to the environmental sustainability of urban and rural communities, including the possibility for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Moreover, the economic importance of land is immense. Land and the buildings on it are approximately seven times as valuable as all other assets taken together and land-use policies play a crucial role in determining land and property prices. Beyond economic value, land also has important sentimental value.

Many people are strongly attached to existing neighbourhoods and landscapes in their vicinity. Thus, it is not surprising that land use is often contested and political conflicts about it are common at the local level.

This report offers analysis and recommendations on land-use policies and practices with particular attention paid to the interactions between planning tools, fiscal frameworks, and incentives. It demonstrates that land use is influenced by a wide range of policies beyond those of the land-use planning system. Tax, transport and environmental policies also create incentives and disincentives to use land in particular ways. As the effects of these incentives are rarely considered, they may lead to unintentional consequences.

This report argues that planners and policy makers in other fields should consider the influence of all public policies on land use. A lack of co-ordination can lead to policies that provide contradicting incentives to developers and land owners. The report calls for more integrated approaches to spatial development that take into account the wide array of policies that affect land use but that are beyond the purview of the planning system itself.

The report also stresses that land-use planning should be more than a technical endeavour – it should be a political and democratic process that mediates the abovementioned conflicts over land use. Through the development of strategic plans, planners ask residents to imagine the future that they want for their cities and communities and jointly develop a road map for how to get there. This requires strong public engagement and communication. In its ideal form, effective planning reflects and develops a common community vision.";"";"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)";"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2017-12-31";"en";"land policies;land use;land use planning";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/957";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/957_38200-2.pdf";"";"";"";"208";"";""
"UNCCD:1010";"Land resource planning for sustainable land management. Current and emerging needs in land resource planning for food security, sustainable livelihoods, integrated landscape management and restoration";"";"A review of needs at various scales for tools and processes that can help countries and stakeholders meet emerging challenges, address increasing degradation of and competition for resources, support the sustainable use and restoration of land and water resources, and ensure resilient ecosystems.

There has been a loss of interest in the discipline of land-use planning in recent decades, largely because little unused and unexplored land remains; moreover, scientists have realized that the relationship between land productivity and ecological/edaphic factors is dependent not only on land or soil potential but also on social and economic factors. On the other hand, management and inputs are still dependent on natural resources such as soil quality, water availability, biodiversity and climate, as well as on infrastructure, access to services and labour, and knowledge. 

For example, less-healthy or less-suitable soils involve a higher cost (e.g. in terms of soil and water conservation measures, irrigation, fertilizers and adapted seeds orother germplasm) to attain the same yield as suitable soils, where suitability involves the ability not only to produce but also to store, process and sell surplus products. Consequently, suitability evaluations that address only land resource potential have declined in importance, while the matching of management options (technologies and approaches) with land uses and socio-economic determinants (e.g. knowledge, inputs, costs and benefits) – as proposed, for example, in Land Degradation Assessment in Dryland Areas (LADA) and the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) – have gained in importance.

Modern approaches to land-use planning not only determine appropriate land-use types but also provide decision-makers with sustainable land resource management scenarios that improve productivity and
sustainability. The scarcity of land and water increases competition for these resources and forces users to intensify production to meet escalating demand. Decision-makers need assistance in determining and putting into practice the best land-use management options for sustaining production.";"Zaidat, Feras

"UNCCD:1204";"Sustainable rangeland management in Sub-Saharan Africa - Guidelines to good practice";"";"In Sub-Saharan Africa, the popular perception of rangelands and their management is that these vast areas have major problems without solutions: the common narrative focuses on overgrazing, herds of undernourished livestock, erosion and desertification, drought, famine, and conflict. 

However, evidence compiled and analysed in this book show that such a view of rangelands – as being unproductive and mismanaged systems – does not reflect reality. It needs reconsideration and revision. 

The overall goal of the guidelines is to demonstrate – through a unique set of convincing case studies and their analysis as well as the development of guiding principles – the value and potential of investment in rangelands.

Rangelands take pride of place among Sub-Saharan Africa’s varied ecosystems. They make up nearly half (48 percent) of the land, or up to 62 percent if woodlands are included, and provide a rich range of resources, including soils, water, vegetation and genetic diversity. These landscapes also have a critical role to play in achieving multiple development gains, including food and nutrition security, water, rural jobs, livelihoods and growth in rapidly transforming economies; climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts; as well as peace, security, stability and natural resource-related conflict prevention.

More specifically, Sub-Saharan Africa’s rangelands feed over 55 percent of Africa’s livestock and provide a major source of income to 268 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists, including in some of the most vulnerable areas.

These Guidelines on Sustainable Rangeland Management in Sub-Saharan Africa come at a critical moment. Rangelands are under growing pressure from land degradation as well as crop and urban land expansion, among other threats.
Moreover, the capacity of rangelands to sustainably supply markets will be tested over the coming decade as the global and regional demand for beef and sheep continues to grow.";"Liniger, Hanspeter

A report of the Science-Policy Interface";"";"The UNCCD-SPI technical report “Realising the Carbon Benefits of Sustainable Land Management Practices: Guidelines for Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon in the Context of Land Degradation” provides decision guidance for the estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in support of appropriate deployment of sustainable land management (SLM) technologies, in order to maintain or increase carbon in the soil and contribute to the achievement of land degradation neutrality (LDN). The report was produced to support the need for policy tools that provide guidance on harmonized methods for accurate estimations of changes in soil (SOC) stocks resulting from SLM interventions.

The report provides a framework and a set of decision trees to help countries i) identify suitable and region-specific SLM practices and approaches to maintain or enhance SOC stocks, and ii) estimate and monitor SOC for land use planning and for monitoring LDN. It also provides a comparative list of tools and models for SOC assessment and selection for SLM approaches and technologies, including approaches for monitoring changes in SOC stocks from local to national scales.

Policy-oriented options include to (i) share the guidance for land managers at the appropriate  level;  (ii)  monitor  SOC  change  as  an  indicator  of  SLM  intervention  to  support  assessment  of  LDN  achievement  in  2030;  (iii)  apply  gender-responsive  actions  addressing  gender-based  differences  and  promote  gender  equality  and  women’s empowerment; (iv) design a framework for LDN Planning and means to support it.";"Chotte, Jean-Luc

"UNCCD:1245";"Land Degradation Neutrality in Small Island Developing States";"";"Land degradation exacerbates the unique vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to environmental challenges, such as climate change, flash floods, soil erosion, lagoon siltation, coastal erosion and sea level rise, undermining their economic potential.

Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in SIDS, preserving biodiversity and increasing resilience to climate change. Land degradation has a strong negative impact on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water resources management and coastal zone management. 
SIDS face a potentially greater strain on these sectors due to their high susceptibility to natural disasters, which often reverses their economic and social improvements. 

Land-based solutions contribute significantly to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, as well as on the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway.

By setting voluntary LDN targets, SIDS have demonstrated strong political leadership. SIDS are strongly committed to the transformative nature of land-based solutions, with a focus on the sustainable management of forests, agriculture and land use planning. The national LDN working groups, established by each country to guide the LDN target setting process, played a central role in the formulation of the sciencebased LDN targets based on the LDN response hierarchy (Avoid > Reduce> Reverse land degradation). 

Nearly 83% of the SIDS set LDN commitments to minimize land degradation from ridge to reef, and to manage artificial areas, by applying LDN-specific land use planning policies and urban design guidelines (such as the ratio of tree cover and/or green area to built-up environment/infrastructure, plot coverage, etc.) as part of the national development strategy. The SIDS effectively underscored the need for innovative land use planning principles (for instance, through a possible amendment of existing acts on activities of physical planning and development authority; improved land use planning based on best practices; strict enforcement of existing land management legislations; and an update of the formulation of land use, policy and inter-agency cooperation).

Investment in land will be important for SIDS to drive transformational change. National mainstreaming of the LDN targets, including mid-term frameworks and budgets, is critical to ensure positive synergies across all sectors. The right policy framework and enabling environment will be important for private sector partnerships to reach their full potential.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2019-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land investments;land use planning;private sector";"Land & Investments;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"ATG;BLZ;COM;CPV;GUY;HTI;JAM;KNA;LCA;MDG;MUS;PNG;SUR;SYC;TLS;TTO;VCT;WSM";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1245";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1245_GM_UNCCD_Report_10_Web.pdf";"";"";"";"24";"";""
"UNCCD:1476";"Land Degradation Neutrality in Small Island Developing States. Technical report";"";"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are continuously under the threat from the adverse effects of climate change and land degradation impacts. Erratic climatic patterns have made daily weather previsions unreliable and are becoming a
challenge for communities to take appropriate timely and preventive measures. Land degradation directly increases CO2 emissions, contributing to climate change and vice versa. The LDN Target Setting Programme (TSP) of the UNCCD has substantially contributed to land degradation receiving the policy attention and securing political commitments for
addressing the obvious and immediate threats of climate change and natural disasters to SIDS. It has strengthened the availability and accessibility of data for assessing land degradation and enabled SIDS toset specific measurable science-based targets.

Leveraging on the building blocks of the LDN TSP with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of UNFCCC, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the CBD, and the Sendai Framework of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), along with monitoring of SDG targets, particularly 15.3, has further consolidated LDN in SIDS. This leveraging
enables setting specific measurable targets for the advancement of the SLM agenda of the UNCCD as well as other MEAs including the SDGs, SAMOA Pathway, Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework.

Moreover, it is essential to integrate LDN and climate actions within national strategic land-use planning mechanisms to ensure that SDGs are met by 2030 and disaster risks are kept to a minimum. It is important for SIDS to further acquire highly accurate spatial land-cover and elevation data and to develop adequate human resource skills to put in place an LDN GIS and remote sensing system at the national level. These will be used to continuously monitor and periodically assess the progress of LDN in SIDS to ensure its implementation by 2030.

The provision of digital/high-resolution imagery and data will help SIDS to predict the extent of future damages and losses occurring due to sea level rise, coastal erosion, saline water intrusion, flash floods and landslides. Building capacity and bridging the knowledge gap in achieving LDN in SIDS will improve the national land-use planning process by encouraging efficient land-resource allocation to various economic and land-use sectors, while ensuring ecosystem functions are restored and protected.

The analysis of the intra-annual distribution of maximal discharges aided in noticing that torrential floods have a seasonal character.

Effective protection from torrential floods encompasses biotechnical works on the slopes in the watershed and technical works on the torrent beds, within a precisely defined administrative and spatial framework in order to achieve maximal safety for people and their property. 

Cooperation to overcome the conflicts between the sectors of the water resources management, forestry, agriculture, energetics, environmental protection and local economic development groups is indispensable at the following levels: policy, spatial planning, practice, investments and education. The lowest and most effective level is through the Plans for Announcement of Erosive Regions (PAERs) and the Plans for Protection from Torrential Floods (PPTFs), with Hazard Zones (HZs) and Threatened Areas (TAs) mapping on the basis of the hydrologic, hydraulic and spatial analysis of the factors that are important for the formation of torrential floods.

The extended SUMAMAD-2 to other world regions  included South America (Bolivia) and Africa (Burkina Faso). This geographic range allows to share dryland management experience and expertise among researchers in Africa, Arab States, Asia, Europe and Latin America.The objectives of SUMAMAD-2 now focus on the following themes:
Fostering scientific drylands research
• Improvement of dryland agriculture (crop and livestock production) through the sustainable use of natural
resources, focusing on sustainable water conservation and harvesting practices.
• Restoration and rehabilitation of degraded drylands, focusing on biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural biotic resources.
Preparation of policy-relevant guidelines for decision-makers in drylands
• Developing scenarios for land-use changes (also in the context of climate change), including the assessment of trade-offs and the economic valuation of dryland services.
• Interfacing with relevant policy-formulation institutions and processes in the respective countries.
Promoting sustainable livelihoods in drylands
• Encouraging alternative income-generating activities and the diversification of economic options, such
as ecotourism, handicraft production, forage, medicinals and dietary diversification, in order to reduce
dependencies on traditional dryland agriculture.
A cross-cutting objective is to strengthen capacity-building in all study sites through training schemes on environmental research and conservation, study visits among field project partners, and environmental education in formal and nonformal contexts (such as using the UNESCO Teaching Resource Kit for Dryland Countries).";"Schaaf, Thomas";"United Nations Development Fund for Women";"United Nations Development Fund for Women";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2012-12-31";"en";"drylands;sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/409";"http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/SUMAMAD_Eighth_%20International_Workshop_Alexandria.pdf";"";"";"";"65";"";""
"UNCCD:410";"Sustainable management of marginal drylands:Using science to promote sustainable development. Project findings from Northern Africa to Asia";"";"The world’s drylands are among the most vulnerable ecosystems on our planet. Desertification and land degradation are affecting huge land areas, jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of people. Unsustainable management practices in dryland cultivation and pastoralism have given rise to widespread soil erosion, reduction of the biological production of soils, reduction of vegetation cover, and depletion of surface and groundwater resources. In the context of global climate change, it is expected that drylands will suffer from higher frequencies and longer periods of drought, which will further threaten future improvements in human well being in these areas. However, positive examples of managing drylands in a sustainable way exist. To put scientific knowledge at the service of improving dryland livelihood systems was the overarching aim of the Sustainable Management of Marginal Drylands (SUMAMAD) project. The project investigated dryland degradation and possible solutions to combat desertification in nine study sites spanning from Northern Africa to Eastern Asia. Research teams from China (with two study sites), Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Pakistan, Syria, Tunisia and Uzbekistan, and involving the expertise of two Belgian universities, carried out in-depth studies on dryland ecosystems which were coupled with socioeconomic analyses with the overall aim to improve livelihood conditions of dryland dwellers.";"Schaaf, Thomas

Options for Sustainable Land Management in Drylands";"";"Humankind currently faces interconnected, worldwide challenges of feeding our rapidly growing population while simultaneously preserving our natural resource base, adapting to climate change, and creating or maintaining favourable living conditions for present and future generations. The world’s population is growing exponentially. It is expected to rise from seven to more than nine billion people in the next few decades. Currently, around one-seventh of the world’s population – the so-called “bottom billion” – does not have a secure food supply, while an expanding middle class in rapidly developing countries is placing increasing
pressure on the limited natural resources available for food production. Projections indicate that agricultural production will have to increase by about 70% by 2050 in order to keep pace with population growth. This has far-reaching implications for the way we use and manage our agricultural lands.
Food production depends on the availability of fertile land, water, favourable climatic conditions, and related ecosystem services. At present, humans are overexploiting natural resources in many regions of the globe in order to obtain short-term benefits. This is leading to clearance of land, an increase in degraded ecosystems, and declining biodiversity.
Additionally, global warming is causing anomalies in rainfall patterns and is increasing the occurrence of extreme weather events like prolonged droughts, floods, and cyclones. In this way, climate change is aggravating pressure on land and water resources, increasing people’s vulnerability by affecting ecosystem resilience and food production potentials, particularly in marginal regions like the drylands in arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid climatic zones.";"Schwilch, G.

"UNCCD:809";"Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management (VGSSM)";"";"Soils are an essential and non-renewable natural resource hosting goods and services vital to ecosystems
and human life. Soils are fundamental for producing crops, feed, fibre, fuel, and they filter and clean tens of thousands of cubic kilometers of water each year. As a major storehouse for carbon, soils also help regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which is fundamental for regulating climate. SSM is an integral part of sustainable land management, as well as a basis for addressing poverty eradication, agricultural and rural development, promoting food security and improving nutrition.
Soil is the world’s largest terrestrial pool of carbon and approximately 95% of global food is produced
in soil. SSM is a valuable tool for climate change adaptation and a pathway for safeguarding key ecosystem services and biodiversity. Due to the incalculable value soils provide to society through ecosystem services, SSM ensures a high return on investment by supporting and increasing these services. Widespread adoption of SSM practices generates multiple socio-economic benefits, especially for smallholder farmers and large scale agricultural producers worldwide whose livelihoods directly depend on their soil resources.
However, evidence recently provided in the Status of the World’s Soil Resources (SWSR) report and other studies shows that about 33% of global soils are moderately or highly degraded, i.e. due to unsustainable management practices. On a global scale an annual loss of 75 billion tons of soil from arable land is estimated to cost about USD 400 billion each year in lost agricultural production. This loss also significantly reduces the soil’s ability to store and cycle carbon, nutrients, and water.

In any case, all societies and people assign historical and cultural value to their landscapes, their nature, and all natural phenomena associated with land. However, lands are in danger. 
Globally, a frightening 10 to 20 per cent of drylands are currently facing degradation and 24 per cent of usable land is already degraded. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), this results in an estimated economic loss of USD 40 billion per year. Evidently, we have to rethink the ways we treat and use our lands. We can no longer take the services that fertile soil presents us with for granted. Common practices concerning current land use need to be reconsidered if we want it to continue providing for us in the future. One way to help address the imminent threat of degradation is to enable practitioners across the world to calculate the true economic value of land, when development and conservation fall within their responsibilities.

Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. Sustainable energy is an opportunity too as it fuels lives, economies and the planet. Getting sustainable energy to all who want it represents one of the biggest development challenges of the 21st century. Research suggests that 1.4 billion people — over 20% of the global population — lack access to electricity, and that at least 2.7 billion people — some 40% of the global population — rely on the traditional use of biomass for cooking. According to International Energy Agency, 1.2 billion people will still lack access to electricity in 2030, 87% of them living in rural areas. The number of people relying on the traditional use of biomass for cooking is anticipated to rise to 2.8 billion in 2030, 82 % of them in rural areas.1 Meeting worldwide growing energy demand is becoming more difficult. With a population set to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, demand for energy, water and food is mounting across the board. Traditionally, growth in demand has been met predominantly by tapping further into fossil fuel, freshwater and land resources. Taken together however, these resources are limited in nature and their extraction and use often has significant social and environmental impacts, from resource-driven conflict to climate change. Business as usual — for energy the extraction of non-renewable fossil fuels like coal and oil — is not an answer. Energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing the carbon intensity of energy is a key objective in long-term climate goals. In a time of climate change, economic growth and social wellbeing will depend heavily on the rapid scaling up of low-carbon, clean energy sources and their effective and efficient distribution.";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2015-12-31";"en";"climate change;land degradation;sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/871";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/871_Energy2_ENG.pdf";"";"";"";"19";"";""

This means ensuring that the amount of healthy and productive land resources that every family, region or country depends on for ecosystems services (water, food, rainfall, etc) remains at least stable.2 Two joint actions need to be taken to make land degradation neutrality happen: • Avoid further land degradation • Recover already degraded land We can fight land degradation by both rehabilitating already degraded and abandoned lands and promoting sustainable land management to avoid it and halt ongoing degradation. To achieve LDN by 2030, large amounts of financial resources need to be mobilized. Public resources alone will not suffice. Thus, it is crucial to attract long term term private investors, as stated in the Addis Abeba Action Agenda.3 This can be achieved by creating a sound framework for, and aligning private investor incentives with, the LDN target.

 A critical means to achieve sustainable dryland and drought risk management is to strengthen resilience through capacity development of individuals, communities, and systems to survive, adapt, and follow a positive trajectory in the face of external and/or internal changes, even catastrophic incidents, and rebound strengthened and more resourceful while retaining essentially the same functions.
  Another critical means is the application of an ecosystem services approach to ensure proper attention to the dynamic and interlinked provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural dryland ecosystem services. The ecosystem services approach has proven particularly useful and challenging for economic valuation of sustainable dryland and drought risk management as a basic tool for direct management purposes as well as policy decision-making. 
 Based on a comprehensive literature review of recent peer-reviewed scientific journals complemented with grey literature, this White Paper provides an introduction to current thinking about economic valuation techniques related to different aspects of dryland management and policy-making. The paper highlights the challenges that exist, the different opinions about the best way to address environmental economic valuations, and the many assumptions that need to be clearly identified for each exercise in order to communicate the results efficiently to decision-makers at all levels.";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2013-12-31";"en";"land degradation;sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/885";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/885_White_Paper_2.pdf";"";"";"";"125";"";""

The protection of land and soil is essential both for adapting to climate change and attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Protecting the land means stemming the factors of forced migrations, reducing the causes of conflicts and alleviating the impact of natural disasters. 

The UNCCD is the only international treaty addressing the need for sustainable management of the land. As such, it can serve as an instrument for collaborative innovation between all parties fighting for environmental security and justice.

"UNCCD:1149";"Success stories in the struggle against desertification. A holistic and integrated approach to environmental conservation and sustainable livelihoods";"";"The remit of this paper is to identify and examine “success” stories in combating desertification.

It is worth clarifying at the start the working definitions of “land degradation” and “success” to be used in the paper. The UNCCD defines Land degradation as:   “reduction or loss, in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rainfed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting from land uses or from a process or combination of processes, including processes arising from human activities and habitation patterns, such as:  (i) soil erosion caused by wind and/or water;  (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical and biological or economic properties of soil; and  (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation” (UNCCD, 1994). 

There are broader definitions in use. For example, the Globan Environment Facility (GEF) definition includes deforestation as a form of LD but in this paper the UNCCD definition is used.

The specific purpose of the Toolkit is: to inform the user of the approaches that can be followed to analyze and value the economic costs of land degradation and the benefits of sustainable land management. ‘Land’ is interpreted broadly in the Toolkit, also including wetlands and coastal zones.

The Toolkit contains five Tools that together present a detailed description of the various relevant ecological and economic assessment methodologies. A number of case studies illustrate the application of thesemethodologies. For policy makers, an executive summary is provided that describes the basic approach and itspotential to support policy making in the field of land and ecosystem management.

The Toolkit is based on an in-depth literature review of (i) the theories and applications of environmental-economic valuation techniques; and (ii) the existing experiences with ecosystem services assessment in thecontext of sustainable land management. Furthermore, the Toolkit has benefited from comments of stakeholdersinvolved in SLM including the Technical Advisors of the LDC and SIDS Targeted Portfolio Project

"UNCCD:1207";"Sustainable Development Report 2019: Transformations to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals";"";"Key findings of the Sustainable Development Report 2019
World nations obtain their worst performance on SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). No country obtains a “green rating” (the report’s indicator for the achievement of an SDG) on SDG 14 (Life Below Water).

The authors conclude that sustainable land use and healthy diets require integrated agriculture, climate, and health policy interventions. New indicators on nations’ trophic level and yield gap closure highlight where energy and agricultural efficiency can be strengthened to support sustainable food supply while addressing negative environmental, biodiversity, and health impacts of diets.

High-income countries generate high environmental and socioeconomic spillover effects such as deforestation as a result of palm oil and other fuel commodity demands, tax havens and banking secrecy that undermine a country’s ability to raise public revenues, and tolerance for poor labor standards in international supply chains that harm the poor and women in particular.

Conflicts in many parts of the world continue to lead to reversals in SDG progress. Modern slavery and the share of waiting detainees in prison remain high, particularly in low-income countries. Trends in corruption and freedom of press are worsening in more than 50 countries covered in the report, including several middle income and high-income countries. Eradicating extreme poverty remains a global challenge with half of the world nations not on track for achieving SDG 1 (No Poverty). In middle- and high-income countries, rising income inequalities and persisting gaps in access to services and opportunities by income or territorial area remain important policy issues.

The report further cautions that land use and food production “are not meeting people’s needs,” and agriculture is destroying biodiversity and forests, squandering water and releasing 25% of global GHG emissions. The report states that 78% of countries for which data is available scored a red rating on sustainable nitrogen management, which is the worst performing indicator across all indicators analyzed in the report. Further, the report states that two billion people are deficient in micronutrients, 800 million people are undernourished (SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2), obesity is rising and 33% of food is wasted (SDG target 12.3). To address these challenges, the report calls for transformations towards sustainable land use and food systems that balance biodiversity conservation and restoration, efficient, resilient agriculture and forestry, and healthy diets.

In September 2019, Heads of State and Governments will convene for the first time in person at the United Nations in New York to review progress on their promises made after four years of working on Agenda 2030. While some countries are slowly moving forward with SDG-focused policies, they are not undergoing the major transformative change that is necessary to successfully achieve the goals by 2030.

The Sustainable Development Report 2019 calls for six major transformations in every country to address skills and jobs, health, clean energy, biodiversity and land use, cities, and digital technology. All countries have a big job ahead to create SDG roadmaps and strategies for success."" says Jeffrey D. Sachs, Director of the SDSN.";"Sachs, J.

"UNCCD:1212";"Tools for Soil Organic Carbon Estimation and Management Science-Policy Brief";"";"Land degradation neutrality (LDN) is achieved if land degradation is avoided or reduced, and new degradation is balanced by reversing degradation elsewhere in the same land type through restoration or rehabilitation. The primary instrument for avoiding and reducing degradation is the application of sustainable land management (SLM) approaches and technologies. Because of its multifunctional roles and its sensitivity to land management, soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the three global indicators for LDN, so predicting and monitoring change in SOC is vital to achieving LDN targets.

Predicting the potential change in SOC stock due to changes in land management is also a challenge. Accurate evaluation of SOC stock change resulting from SLM interventions is often limited by the availability of data and the performance of tools/models for SOC assessment. Therefore, targeted investment in SOC estimation is vital.

"UNCCD:1220";"Global Land Outlook: West Africa Thematic Report: Land Degradation Neutrality: Benefits for Human Security";"";"Located in the arid and semi-arid areas of West Africa, the Sahel has undergone profound changes over the past 50 years. Known for the prevalence of land degradation processes, the Sahel is suffering from the combined negative effects of population growth, human activities and climate variability, resulting in recurrent droughts and the continued decline of natural resources and land productivity. While agriculture, livestock and forestry provide income and employment for more than 80% of the population, overexploitation of natural resources and unsustainable water and agro- and silvo-pastoral land management practices threaten rural livelihoods and economic development. This has direct and persistent impacts on food, water and energy security as well as amplifying social inequalities, conflicts over access to land and resources, and forced migration. While the situation in the region seems critical, solutions exist to reverse these trends.

This GLO regional thematic report analyses the challenges, constraints and assets of 7 countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Nigeria), highlighting past achievements and future opportunities to promote sustainable and inclusive development throughout the entire region. In response to land degradation trends, good practices for Sustainable Land Management (SLM) have been developed. Often implemented at the instigation of local communities, they have reduced soil erosion, restored vegetation cover, retained water for irrigation, improved agro- and silvo-pastoral production and increased the resilience of ecosystems and populations in the face of climate change. In addition, youth and women have an essential role to play in developing and managing the productive potential of land, since more than 60% of the population is under 25 years of age and women farmers represent more than 40% of the agricultural labour force. Finally, many parts of the Sahel have groundwater and surface water resources sufficient for local needs, vast areas of land and perpetual sunshine - an important source of renewable energy that has yet to be exploited.

"UNCCD:1260";"Talking about. Annotated Glossary on Combating Desertification and Sustainable Land Mangement";"";"In the past decades, debates on agriculture, land use and management of natural resources have coined a wealth of new terms. In many cases, these are in full vogue for just a period, replace older ones or are used for political reasons. Meanwhile, there are so many terms that it is difficult to keep track and distinguish them from each other.

This annotated glossary offers a unitary and coherent use of key notions from the BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) and implementing agencies and works towards a universal agreement on their use with partners and agents. Its aim is to distinguish terms  in  the  field  of  combating  desertification  and  sustainable  land  management  from  each  other,  to  reveal  cohesions  and  hierarchies  between  them  and  trace  their  development.  The  glossary  in  German  and  English  language  contains  a  selection  of  the  most  commonly  used  terms while raising no claim to completeness. If necessary, it can always be supplemented with further items.For most terms, there are several definitions, often differing only slightly. 

The differences fre-quently originate in the interests and priorities of institutions and organisations. For this rea-son,  even  common  definitions  are  adjusted  to  new  conditions  and  challenges  from  time  to  time. In most cases, the authors selected more than one definition, concentrating on univer-sally  recognised  definitions  by  leading  institutions  and  those  stressing  different  aspects  of  a  term. For every definition, the source and, when possible, a hyperlink, are provided allowing citation, verification and further reading.

"UNCCD:1289";"Listening to our Land: Stories of Resilience";"";"Productive land is a critical natural asset for rural communities in developing nations, providing them with a wide range of ecosystem resources, such as water, fertile soils, plant and genetic diversity – on which they depend daily for survival. For many communities, the land is also an integral part of their cultural identity, helping to maintain social cohesion and stability, in addition to building resilience to socio-ecological shocks and risks such as those caused by climate change. But land is a vulnerable resource that must be managed and restored to ensure a sustainable future.

Globally, land degradation adversely affects approximately two billion hectares of land – about one quarter of all landscapes that are under humanuse. The deterioration of soil fertility, loss of forest cover, and erosion of rangelands causes biodiversity loss and compromises the flow of ecosystem services that enable food production and support the livelihoods of millions of people. If current trends in land degradation are not reversed, an estimated 135 million people may be displaced by 2045 because of desertification, with cascading social, economic, and environmental consequences.

The scale of the problem is immense, but so is our determination and commitment to address it. We believe that the tools we have at our disposal for addressing land degradation are better now than ever before – the stories in this book are evidence of that.

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a financial mechanism for implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Since 2006, the GEF has invested more than US$876 million in over 190 programmes and projects that encourage Sustainable Land Management (SLM) as a comprehensive and socially-inclusive way to improve land stewardship in support of achieving multiple goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In particular, SDG target 15.3, to combat desertification and restore degraded land and soil, provides the core vehicle for this effort. As an implementing agency of the GEF, and as a key partner forthe UNCCD, UNDP currently provides support to implement 85 SLM projects in 53 countries, with a total resource envelope of about US$357 million and leveraging co-financing in the order of US$1.38 billion. This work is complemented by local and community-led efforts, supported by the UNDP-managed Equator Initiative and the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP).

This publication tells stories of people’s work on the land. Through descriptions of their relationship with their land and their efforts to improve its quality through sustainable land management practices, this book highlights the impacts of SLM projects supported by UNDP and funded by the GEF in eight selected countries. Each story has been chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of a particular approach to SLM, reflected through the personal perspectives of project beneficiaries. These accounts present evidence that investing in improved land stewardship is an effective tool for restoring and maintaining productivity and resilience of the land, strengthening adaptation to climate change, reducing conflict over natural resources, and helping communities thrive.";"";"United Nations Development Programme";"United Nations Development Programme";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2017-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land degradation;resilience;sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1289";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1289_UNDP_Listening_to_our_land.pdf";"";"";"";"65";"";""

At the same time, the 22 countries of the region are bound together by a common history, language and culture. We share many similar challenges and opportunities. Instability and human insecurity are in no one’s interest. While progress in many areas of sustainable development is hindered by conflicts and instability, the opposite is also true: durable regional peace and security can only be achieved if all its countries are able to provide well-being to their populations while protecting their natural resources and the environment.

The Arab Region SDG Index and Dashboards are intended as a tool for governments and other stakeholders to
measure progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to highlight gaps in both implementation
and data. The 2019 Arab Region SDG Index is the first in its kind and is therefore also intended as a conversationopener
about priority areas, policies and actions.

The 2019 Arab Region SDG Index comprises 105 indicators, each of which have an assigned score (0–100) and a
traffic light colour (green, yellow, orange, or red) to indicate performance. In addition, arrows indicate trends in
progress towards achieving the goals for those indicators where data for multiple years are available.

Compared to the Sustainable Development Report 2019, which contains the SDG Index and Dashboards for all UN
Member States, the Arab Region Index introduces 30 new indicators that reflect regional priorities and challenges.
The selection of these indicators, along with related thresholds, was greatly informed by two rounds of regional
expert consultations, which were conducted in May and August 2019 and collected more than 200 comments
from more than 40 individuals. The regional Index also removes indicators that are not useful or relevant for the
region or where data coverage is currently insufficient.

In addition, the 2019 Arab Region Index includes Palestine, which has so far not been included in the global SDG
Index reports. It also provides a total SDG achievement score for two countries – Libya and Somalia – that did not
receive one in the global Index due to low data availability.";"Dahan, Lara

"UNCCD:1346";"2019 Europe Sustainable Development Report";"";"This report comes at a critical time for Europe. The new President and Commission have already committed to a European Green Deal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. They have further pledged to place the SDGs at the centre of the European Semester – the Union’s framework for the coordination of economic policies across member states. Indeed, in their mission letters each new Commissioner is asked to ensure “the delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals within their policy area. The College as a whole will be responsible for the overall implementation of the Goals.”

European countries lead globally on the SDGs, but none are on track to achieve the Goals by 2030. According to the global 2019 SDG Index prepared by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), all ten countries closest to achieving the SDGs are in Europe, a truly remarkable performance in the international perspective. Yet, as the EU SDG Index and Dashboards show, no European country is on track towards achieving the goals. 

The EU and its member states face the greatest challenges on goals related to climate, biodiversity, and circular economy, as well as in strengthening the convergence in living standards, across countries and regions. In particular, countries need to accelerate progress towards climate change (SDG 13), sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), protection and conservation of biodiversity (SDGs 14 and 15), and sustainable agriculture and food systems (SDG 2). Many countries are falling back on “leave no one behind”, so the EU’s SDG strategy must place emphasis on strengthening social inclusion for all people living in its territory. Education and innovation capacities must be improved to raise living standards in poorer member states and accelerate the convergence in living standards.

European countries also generate large, negative spillovers that impede other countries’ ability to achieve the SDGs. Such spillovers comprise environmental spillovers (such as greenhouse gas emissions or biodiversity loss embodied in trade), financial and governance spillovers (such as banking secrecy), and security spillovers (such as weapons exports). The EU’s SDG strategy must identify and address negative international spillovers.";"Sachs, J.

"UNCCD:1347";"2019 US Cities Sustainable Development Report";"";"US cities are at the forefront of the sustainable development challenge. They contain 80% of the country’s population, and therefore have the capacity to make or break SDG achievement (US Census Bureau 2016). But, while crucial to SDG attainment, they Executive Summary cannot accomplish this alone. While 80 percent of US residents live in urban areas, only 3 percent of land is urban; rural and urban areas are deeply interconnected (US Census Bureau 2016). 

To promote accountability and cooperation on SDG achievement at multiple scales, SDSN produces two additional indices that are relevant to the US: The Sustainable Development Report of the United States, which assesses SDG progress at the state level; and the Sustainable Development Report, which assesses SDG progress at the global level. In this year’s city index, we aim to highlight the interconnections between these three reports to put city performance in context.

When comparing results from the city, state, and global SDG indices, or looking at cities in the US of similar sizes or geographies, it is clear that localization is key. Localization efforts cannot be isolated, either - city governments looking to take on the SDG agenda should engage in networks of practice at multiple levels of government and across sectors to include businesses, universities, and civil society. This updated 2019 US Cities Sustainable Development Report adds nuance and context to further this important national dialogue.

The 2019 US Cities Sustainable Development Report presents an overview of how cities are performing on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Cities are given an overall score of 0 to 100, which can be interpreted as the percent of progress a city has made towards achieving the SDGs.

It builds on previous work conducted by SDSN to monitor the SDGs at national and subnational levels and on TELOS’ scoping study “Sustainability Monitoring of European Cities” prepared in collaboration with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Environment.The interactive dashboard provides a visual representation of cities' performance by SDGs to identify priorities for action.

How can it help? – This is the first report comparing the performance (index scores and detailed dashboards) of capital cities and a selection of large metropolitan areas in the EU and EFTA on the 17 SDGs. In total, results for 45 European cities using 59 indicators are presented in this first prototype version.

Results: Three Nordic European cities are at the top of the Index this year – Oslo, Stockholm and Helsinki. Yet, even for these top performing cities major challenges remain in order to achieve all 17 SDGs. The report generates five major findings:

    No capital cities and large metropolitan in Europe has achieved the SDG’s.
    There are persistent challenges related to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).
    Decarbonizing transportation in cities and providing access to affordable housing remain major policy priorities.
    Compared to the US Cities Index, better nutrition, diet and a more active lifestyle in Europe drive higher performance on SDG 2 (No Hunger) and SDG 3 (Health and Well-Being).
    Inequalities in economic and social outcomes and international spillover effects from consumption in cities require better data.

The report was prepared by a team of researchers from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Brabant Center for Sustainable Development (Telos, Tilburg University).

"UNCCD:1498";"Supporting the Global Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Land-based Solutions for Healthy People and a Healthy Planet";"";"Land is the foundation for all life on Earth. How land is used and managed influences nature, food, water, energy, climate, and even our health. Today, the pressures on land and the wealth of resources it provides are greater than at any other time in human history. Nearly three quarters of the Earth’s ice-free land has been transformed from its natural state, mainly to meet the demand for food, raw materials and human settlement.1,2 Even more alarming is the accelerated pace of land conversion, in order to provide the food, animal feed, fiber, bioenergy and water needed to achieve all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Over the past 50 years, industrial production, technological development and our changing consumption patterns have significantly altered all ecosystems, putting over 1 million species at risk.

Since late 2019, the world has been struggling to contain an outbreak of a new zoonotic virus commonly called COVID-19, and the repercussions have been colossal. Beyond the devastating public health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into a complex emergency with significant humanitarian, socio-economic, political and security dimensions. It has laid bare the vulnerability of both our human and natural systems, which were already threatened by climate change. On the economic front, recession and the contraction of per capita income is taking place in more countries simultaneously than at any other point since 1870.12  The pandemic poses a real challenge to the global goal of ending poverty by 2030 (SDG 1)13 , which is now projected to increase for the first time since 1990.14  Poor, marginalized communities, without any support or safety net, are particularly vulnerable, and the number suffering from hunger could go from 135 million to more than 250 million people.15 The agricultural labor force is buckling under the strain of the lockdown response to the pandemic and almost 1.6 billion informal economy workers are significantly impacted.16  The resilience of global systems in most sectors has taken a tremendous hit, leading to dramatic swings in commodity markets and serious food supply chain disruptions,17  a sharp contraction in remittances—the largest source of foreign exchange earnings for emerging markets and developing countries,18  and even signs of reverse migration between countries and from urban back to rural areas.19The pandemic-driven economic crisis itself brings impacts on human health that extend beyond the pandemic itself. 

As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grow, disruptions in other healthcare areas have been significant, particularly for the most vulnerable. The ripple effects of the lockdown have rebounded upon already beleaguered health care systems in ways that will affect many who may have already weathered the coronavirus storm. For example, the developing world could witness 1.4 million excess tuberculosis deaths by 202520 , while in sub-Saharan Africa over the next year, experts have predicted the possibility of 500,000 excess deaths due to AIDS-related illnesses21  and 325,000 excess malaria deaths.2

"UNCCD:1618";"Sustainable Development Goals and the environment in Europe: a cross-country analysis and 39 country profiles";"";"At the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit on 25-26 September 2015, world leaders adopted the global framework ‘Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, which included 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. The 2030 Agenda builds on the Millennium Development Goals and aims to eradicate poverty, leaving no one behind, and to shift the world on to a sustainable and resilient path.
The SDGs are clustered into five areas, which are also known as the ‘5Ps’ of the 2030 Agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. The planet cluster covers SDGs with an environmental focus and aims, inter alia, to protect the planet from degradation by promoting sustainable consumption and production, the sustainable management of natural resources, and taking urgent action on climate change.

To track progress towards the SDGs, the UN adopted a revised set of global indicators in July 2017, which includes 232 indicators covering all 169 targets. Throughout 2019, a comprehensive review was conducted to improve the global monitoring framework and facilitate global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda. As a result, the global set now includes 231 indicators with the available methodology. At the European level, Eurostat leads the development and review of the EU SDG indicator set, which was first published on 31 May 2017 and subsequently updated each year (latest update was 16 January 2020). Based on this set of indicators, Eurostat is responsible for publishing annual EU SDG monitoring reports, the latest of which was published in June 2020.

"UNCCD:1627";"Community Approaches to Sustainable Land Management and Agroecology Practices";"";"As of 2017, SGP has awarded over 3,800 small grants to land degradation projects in over 120 countries, many of which are in regions with extreme levels of poverty and food insecurity across Africa and Latin America. Africa, in particular, is experiencing the highest population growth of the developing world, while being exposed and vulnerable to the rising impact from climate change. The collective outcomes of these successful projects show that with careful and targeted intervention communities are being able to address the drivers of land degradation, reverse the negative trends in soil fertility, secure nutritious food from their lands, and sometimes generating a surplus which provides much needed income to meet health and educational requirements of their children.

Healthy land is fundamental for human life and wellbeing. It provides food, water, carbon, and other benefits that are essential for our life. However, land degradation is increasingly becoming one of the major global environmental issues today. It is estimated that almost a quarter (22.5 percent) of land has been degraded since the mid-twentieth century.

With the global population on the rise, coupled with climate change, the pressure on land and the natural environment are increasing. Local communities are often bearing the brunt of this burden. In particular, poor, women, indigenous peoples, youth, and other vulnerable communities are disproportionately impacted by land degradation.

The GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP), implemented by UNDP, has been playing a key role in promoting Sustainable Land Management at the community level. The focus of our program is on: 1) reducing pressures on natural resources from competing land uses in the wider landscapes; and 2) maintaining or improving the flows of agro-ecosystem services to sustain livelihoods of local communities. The program is fully in line with the Global Environment Facility’s strategy on sustainable land management and other related programe. It also clearly supports the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and its 10 year Strategic Plan on Land Degradation Neutrality.

The Sustainable Land Management program is quickly becoming one of the largest portfolio of the SGP. Together with partners, the SGP supports community organizations to use approaches, techniques and methodologies in line with
the principles of agroecology and climate-sensitive land resources management.
In this publication, you will find good practices and approaches that has been tested and proven successful by SGP projects around the world. These initiatives have shown evidence on improved land management by communities, nested on traditional knowledge and innovation.

The high rate of land degradation is threatening livelihoods and leading to biodiversity and habitat loss. Population pressure and pervasive poverty resulting from political, social and economic stressors is increasing food insecurity in vulnerable communities across the developing world. Against this backdrop, the world will need to increase food production by 60 to 70 percent by 2050. Unless there is a shift in the way land and soils are managed for food production, biodiversity and ecosystem services may be locked into a downward trajectory from which recovery will be impossible or too costly to achieve.

The expansion of food production need not come at the expense of native habitat. Rehabilitating and restoring degraded lands offers tremendous opportunities to boost production and enhance food security. Improving land use practices can also go a long way in preserving the health of soils and optimizing the use of water. The GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP), implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has been working with community organizations around the world to identify, implement and scale-up innovative technologies in sustainable land management (SLM). Grassroots agroecological practices that integrate the management of land, water, and biodiversity
are starting to meet rising food demands particularly in vulnerable communities of dryland countries. By investing and working with communities on sustainable land management and agroecology, SGP has introduced and disseminated appropriate policies and incentives to accelerate pro-poor growth, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 15 – Life on Land.";"";"Global Environment Facility;United Nations Development Programme";"United Nations Development Programme";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2018-12-31";"en";"agricultural land management;agriculture;biodiversity;climate change;food security;forest management plans;land degradation;sustainable land management";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"018;ARM;BRB;CHN;CUB;ERI;GMB;MNG;NGA;TZA;ZAF;ZWE";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1627";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1627_untitled.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""
"UNCCD:200000254";"Informing investments in land degradation neutrality efforts: A triage approach to decision making";"";"Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 15.3 commits countries to strive towards land degradation neutrality (LDN) by 2030. LDN requires reductions in land quality to be balanced by efforts to restore or rehabilitate degraded areas. However, decisions need to be made as to where to invest given limited budgets and the impossibility of targeting all degraded land. 

Any prioritisation process is likely to be controversial and needs to be underpinned by transparent, justifiable, repeatable decision processes. In this paper, the authors develop a triage approach for LDN, drawing on experiences from biodiversity conservation. In conservation, triage refers to prioritisation where for a given budget, threatened species, habitats or ecosystems receive management if they contribute more to the achievement of particular objectives (e.g. maintaining ecosystem function, ensuring the survival of a species) and the management actions are more likely to be successful. 

Conservation triage has proved both effective in allocating scarce resources, and controversial, as it requires acceptance that it is not possible to save everything. The authors present a decision framework 'the Decision Dahlia' that transposes triage principles to the LDN decision context, recognising that not all land can be improved. 

First, the authors consider countries’ reporting needs on SDG 15.3 and set out a decision process to support progress towards three biophysical global indicators agreed by the United Nations. Second, they take a more people-centred approach, recognising the imperative for social justice and good governance, matching LDN investment decisions more closely with societal needs in an integrated social-ecological systems approach. The authors then reflect on the remaining risks, such as the potential for vulnerable areas to miss out on investments due to the scale of decision making and challenges of leakage. 

While the authors acknowledge the controversial nature of the approach, they argue that a decision framework grounded in triage principles, offers a transparent, justifiable and repeatable process for deciding where to invest in efforts to achieve LDN. This can lower financial costs and help to reduce risks so that ‘striving towards LDN’ does not exacerbate existing drivers of land loss and worsen poverty.";"Dallimer, Martin

This paper is the first to link ecological theory of non-linear ecosystem dynamics to Land Degradation Neutrality offering essential insights into appropriate timings, climate-induced windows of opportunities and risks and the financial viability of investments.

"UNCCD:200000278";"China’s land resources dilemma: Problems, outcomes, and options for sustainable land restoration";"";"Pressing issues such as water and food security, health, peace, and poverty are deeply linked to land degradation. The authors use China’s major land restoration programs as a case offering perspective on the existing problems in China’s major policies for improving degraded land and maintaining land resources in three dimensions. 

The shortcomings and outcomes in terms of biophysical consequences, socioeconomic benefits, and political goals are addressed, namely (i) non-integrated land resources management creates new problems while solving existing problems, (ii) non-participatory processes and “one-size-fits-all” measures compromise socioeconomic benefits, and (iii) implementation outcomes conflict with policy targets for sustainable land management and development. 

Based on discussions for more sustainable land management, the authors conclude that China needs to create a new mode of ‘economy and environment’ in plans and actions of restoring degraded land resources. Establishing multifunctional land-use systems based on formulating and balancing multiple benefits/services across socio-ecological sectors can be an option to achieve such a mode. 

At the end, recommendations are given for research and implementation that are not only vital for China but also relevant for other regions since the challenges of afforestation and sustainable land development faced in China are not unique.";"Zhang, Lulu

It challenges the claims of organic agriculture’s environmental superiority compared to well-managed, conventional agriculture. 

The relative advantages of these contrasting approaches to farming in areas such as aggregate land requirements, biodiversity/habitat loss, water quality, land degradation and climate change are considered. Legitimate concerns about conventional agriculture’s adverse environmental and health impacts need to be addressed and many harmful practices transformed. Nonetheless, careful, sustainably-run, conventional operations can avoid many of the pitfalls and hazards which are often associated with high-input agriculture. 

The higher yields provided by conventional agriculture offer a more sustainable strategy than a chemical-free agricultural system at the global level for meeting the needs of burgeoning populations and reducing agriculture’s aggregate environmental impact.";"Tal, Alon";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2018-12-31";"en";"sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/200000280";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/280_Article_sustainability-10-01078.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""
"UNCCD:200000325";"Who uses sustainable land management practices and what are the costs and benefits? Insights from Kenya";"";"Suboptimal land management practices are degrading soils and undermining food production. Sustainable land management (SLM) practices can improve soil and enhance yields. 

This study identifies variations in SLM uptake, characterising farmers most likely to use SLM practices, identifying when it makes economic sense for farmers to implement particular SLM practices and how long it takes before benefits exceed costs. Using questionnaire data from farmers in western Kenya, we undertake a cost–benefit analysis and analyse determinants of SLM practice use. SLM implementation varied between counties and SLM practice(s), with household and farm characteristics, and access to assets and advice, playing a key role. 

SLM practices with high upfront and maintenance costs (e.g., terraces and agroforestry) offer low benefitto‐cost ratios for individual farmers who must also wait many years to break even on their investments. Nevertheless, over the policy‐relevant time horizon considered (to 2030), Net present value can be positive. Simple SLM practices (manuring and intercropping) have low input costs and offer high benefit to cost ratios, providing a positive net present value up to 2030. Findings suggest that simple practices should be prioritised within policy to improve soil and increase yields. 

These should be supported by subsidies or other economic measures, facilitating uptake of practices such as agroforestry, which can provide wider societal benefits (e.g., improved water retention and carbon sequestration). Economic mechanisms could be augmented with support for agricultural innovation systems, improved monitoring of land management and yield relationships, and investment in climate and soil information services.";"Dallimer, Martin

"UNCCD:200000382";"Desertification Convention Essential for Food Security";"";"The deterioration of land resources in the world's arid and semi-arid regions is one of the gravest problems facing our planet and its people. Desertification, broadly defined, is one of the principal barriers to sustainable food security and sustainable livelihoods in our world today. It is not a future global threat; it is a devastating day-to-day local reality. If we aspire to provide sustainable food security and sustainable livelihood for the world's expanding populations, we must not merely attack desertification; we must not merely halt desertification, but actually reverse desertification.

An effective international convention on desertification is key to seeing that this future tragedy does not occur, and that today's deplorable situation is successfully addressed. At stake are the lives and well-being of the thousand million people who inhabit areas that are prone to drought and desertification. The countries most severely affected are among the poorest, with the lowest rankings on the Human Development Index, while within these countries the people most affected are the poorest and most marginalized. Failure to deal with desertification will accelerate the vicious cycle of expanding poverty, environmental decline, and mounting population pressures, leading to more emergency situations of famine and called-for relief.

It is my hope that, through the convention, we can develop a truly global partnership to bring desertification under control, to move to sustainable management of dryland areas, and to reclaim degraded arid lands. We should be very explicit about the convention's objectives. A priority, stated objective should be to reverse the desertification process in all countries where it is severe, and to do so within a designated time-frame.";"Speth, James Gustave";"";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"1994-12-31";"en";"food security;sustainable land management";"Land & Food Security;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/200000382";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/382_Article_guest_commial_for_food_security.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""

DID YOU KNOW:
➢ Roughly 122 million young people will enter the labor force between 2010 and 2020, with slightly more than half of them from rural areas, putting immense pressure on both agriculture and non-farm sectors to generate employment opportunities. However, even under highly favorable conditions, Fine et al. (2012) estimate that non-farm sectors can generate only
• 70 million wage jobs over this same period, mainly in manufacturing, retailing, hospitality, and government. This means that farming will be called upon to provide gainful employment for at least a third of Africa’s young labor force
However, for agriculture to effectively fulfill this mandate, young people growing up in densely populated areas will require access to farm technologies that are radically more productive and profitable, as well as access to new land. Hence, even as Africa becomes progressively urbanized, smallholder agriculture will remain fundamental for absorbing much of Africa’s burgeoning young labor force into gainful employment (Losch, 2012). A related consequence of Africa’s demographic ‘‘youth bulge’’ is that intergenerational subdivision of land will constrain the options of rural youth entering the labor force. Intergenerational and inter-sibling conflicts may intensify further because rural parents in their 50s and 60s may not yet be ready or able to ‘‘retire’’ and bequeath their land assets to their children, or otherwise subdivide their land.
Agricultural and rural development strategies in the region will need to more fully anticipate the implications of Africa’s rapidly changing land and demographic situation, and the immense challenges that mounting land pressures pose in the context of current evidence of unsustainable agricultural intensification, a rapidly rising labor force associated with the region’s current demographic conditions, and limited nonfarm job creation. These challenges are manageable but will require explicit policy actions to address the unique development challenges in densely populated rural areas.";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"agriculture;sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/600000066";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/66_Loose_leaf_SLM_JOBS_July_2020.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""

The Convention addresses specifically the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, known as the drylands, where some of the most vulnerable ecosystems and peoples can be found.

The new UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework is the most comprehensive global commitment to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) in order to restore the productivity of vast expanses of degraded land, improve the livelihoods of more than 1.3 billion people, and reduce the impacts of drought on vulnerable populations to build

A future that avoids, minimizes, and reverses desertification/land degradation and mitigates the effects of drought in affected areas at all levels ... to achieve a land degradation-neutral world consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development   

The Convention’s 197 parties work together to improve the living conditions for people in drylands, to maintain and restore land and soil productivity, and to mitigate the effects of drought. The UNCCD is particularly committed to a bottom-up approach, encouraging the participation of local people in combating desertification and land degradation. The UNCCD secretariat facilitates cooperation between developed and developing countries, particularly around knowledge and technology transfer for sustainable land management.

As the dynamics of land, climate and biodiversity are intimately connected, the UNCCD collaborates closely with the other two Rio Conventions; the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to meet these complex challenges with an integrated approach and the best possible use of natural resources.";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2020-12-31";"en";"capacity building;desertification;land degradation;sustainable land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/600000093";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/93_Loose_leaf_About UNCCD.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""
"UNCCD:1312";"Rangelands: Participatory rangeland resource mapping as a valuable tool for village land use planning in Tanzania";"";"The Sustainable Rangeland Management Project (SRMP) aims at securing land and resource rights of pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and crop farmers, while improving land management by supporting village and district land use planning and rangeland management in Kiteto, Bahi, Chamwino and Kondoa Districts in Tanzania. More broadly, it aims at influencing policy formulation and implementation on these issues.

Facilitated by financial and technical support from IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) and the International Land Coalition (through the Pastoralist Basket Fund), key partners include the District Councils of the 4 districts, the Ministry of Livestock Development and Fisheries (MLDF), the National Land Use Planning Commission (NLUPC) and civil society organisations supporting village land use planning and rangeland management including the project host KINNAPA Development Programme.

An important part of this endeavour is to introduce new ideas and suggest improvements to the village land use planning (VLUP) process in order to better contribute to sustainable rangeland management. A key challenge, for example, is ensuring the maintenance of livestock movements for optimising pastoral production systems across village boundaries. Participatory rangeland mapping proved to be a useful tool for documenting and gaining a better understanding of methods for facilitating such movements into the VLUP mapping process. In response, CARE Tanzania and the ILC technical advisor organised a five-day training and pilot process mapping in two neighbouring villages – Ng’abolo and Ndedo villages in Kiteto District.

The objectives of the participatory rangeland mappingThe participatory rangeland mapping in Kiteto served a dual purpose. First, it improved understanding of local resource use, distribution and management. Second, it was an opportunity to introduce a new VLUP mapping tool for those working within SRMP (CARE, CSO and government staff ). The mapping exercise aimed at providing information that would feed into the VLUP process. This included:
• Mapping of resources and routes taken to access them;
• Identification of those resources that are key to current livelihood systems;
• Evaluation of how access to these resources has changed and the related causes;
• Determination of current practices for accessing and managing resources; and
• Identification of methodologies for maintaining access to resources that are key to current livelihoods systems, including the option of developing cross-village agreements as part of VLUP.

The mapping process proved to be a useful addition to the VLUP investigation stage prior to negotiations over and definition of land uses, helping to establish the baseline for cross-village agreements. This project demonstrated that such mapping also provides useful input to general community development planning processes such as ‘obstacles and opportunities for development’.";"Flintan, Fiona";"";"International Land Coalition";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2012-12-31";"en";"land rights;land tenure;land use;rangelands;tenure security";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"TZA";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1312";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1312_ILC_Mapping_Rangelands.pdf";"";"";"";"15";"";""
"UNCCD:1313";"Rangelands: Village land use planning in rangelands in Tanzania: good practice and lessons learned";"";"Rangelands provide numerous goods and services that have great economic, social, cultural, and biological value. Inhabitants of rangelands have engineered pastoral, hunter-gatherer, and farming systems that have sustained their livelihoods in these usually dry environments for centuries. Primarily, rangelands are grazing-dependent systems, characterised by dry periods and droughts. However, these characteristics should not be a barrier to development and can be managed through careful planning and management of resources. 

Rangeland communities’ territories are closely associated with permanent water points. Some differentiate between “territories of transhumance” (wet grazing areas) and “territories of anchorage” (dry grazing areas), which enclose strategic resources such as wells and riverside grazing. Pastoralists employ highly specialised risk-spreading strategies to safeguard herds in this harsh environment. 

Introducing village land use planning (VLUP) processes in a rangelands context is challenging. Pastoralist and hunter-gatherer production systems often require movement across village boundaries to access or share grazing or water resources. Pastoralists and hunter-gatherers may classify and use land in ways that do not fit easily with government definitions or processes. Grazing is often patchily distributed, and large areas of rangeland with flexible use are required. Pastoralism and hunter-gathering are integrated and multiple-use land use systems, which rely upon collective use and management of natural resources by customary institutions. Unless due care and attention is given to the process and outcome, VLUP may conflict with all of these requirements.

This document, developed by the Sustainable Rangeland Management Project (SRMP), seeks to suggest improvements to the VLUP process in order to better contribute to sustainable rangeland management. It brings together experience from different organisations and government departments working on VLUP in rangelands areas of Tanzania, as well as relevant lessons from other contexts.

Despite a wealth of land-related legislation, pastoralists in Tanzania are considered highly vulnerable in terms of land security. The implementation of legal frameworks and government initiatives has often denied their rights, and they have been forcibly evicted from traditional lands to make way for large-scale farming and other activities. The policy environment fuels conflict, with contradictions between different pieces of legislation. The planning process can be over-complicated and burdensome, and villages require external support to demarcate their boundaries.

The Village Land Act (VLA) of 1999 provides for the management and administration of land within village boundaries. It recognises communal land for certain groups, but is vague when it comes to titles for traditionally held customary land. Despite perceptions to the contrary, the authority of Village Councils (VCs) covers only certain rural lands, and a large portion remains under the control of traditional systems of land allocation and tenure. A potential conflict exists between village authorities and traditional authorities in terms of land management, and there are also problems in defining pastoral tenure and practice.";"Flintan, Fiona";"";"International Land Coalition";"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification";"2013-12-31";"en";"land rights;land tenure;land use;rangelands;tenure security";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"TZA";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://library.unccd.int/Details/fullCatalogue/1313";"http://catalogue.unccd.int/1313_ILC_Rangelands_3.pdf";"";"";"";"80";"";""
