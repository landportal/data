The drop in prices paid to Lao rubber growers has been precipitous; from highs around CNY 14/kg of lump rubber (yang korn) in 2011, prices fell by half, then by half again, reaching a low around CNY 3.5/kg in 2014; prices during our fieldwork were just slightly higher (~CNY 4) and have since fallen even lower (~CNY 2.5). This study examines responses to this price drop by Lao rubber growers and state institutions. It also examines the reasons that prices are what they are, given that price volatility was identified as a risk during the mid-2000s, and that in at least some cases, steps were taken to prevent contract farmers from falling rubber prices. Drawing on 20 days of fieldwork in mid-2015 in five districts and seven villages of Luang Namtha and Oudomxai provinces, this study is one of the first pieces of research to connect an earlier body of research on the rubber-planting boom of the 2000s with the more recent fall in prices. Its focus is on qualitative changes that have taken – and are currently taking – place in northern Laos; these were captured through 33 key informant interviews with 68 participants at the provincial, district and village levels, as well as a review of available scientific literature, media reports and online sources and consultation with a small group of expert researchers.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Government-promoted rubber plantation has led to widespread land conversion to mono-culture rubber cultivation in northeast Thailand. To understand what household characteristics influence the decision for land conversion from traditional rice and upland crops cultivation and its impacts on sustainability, the study was conducted in Nong Khai and Bueng Kan provinces of northeast Thailand by analyzing land-use changes between 2002 and 2013. Majority of conversion to rubber took place in paddy-growing areas and the economic returns from rubber along with institutional support from the government played a key role in encouraging farmers to convert to rubber. Other household characteristics, such as farmers’ experiences, age of household head, land security, size of paddy area owned, and off-farm income were important factors influencing the conversion. The reduction of paddy fields may be associated with an increased risk of food insecurity of smallholders. Spatial analysis showed that 76% of new rubber plantations currently are in environmentally unsuitable marginal areas, which are otherwise important for biodiversity conservation, watershed function, and environmental protection. The study findings will help to clarify the influencing factors on land conversion to rubber plantation and to highlight some of the environmental issues for developing sustainable extension strategies to ensure food security, reduce poverty and protect the environment from rubber plantation.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Viet Nam has been characterised by smallholder agriculture with relatively little private concentration of land; however, there is a new trend of growing inequality in access to land. Unlike Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar (the other countries examined in this series), Viet Nam has seen limited development of large-scale private plantation agriculture in recent years. The loss of land by smallholders has occurred in different parts of the country in different ways and by a range of processes closely linked to the country’s rapid development toward a more industrialised, urbanised market economy. In the Mekong Delta, landlessness is associated with debt, historical patterns of landlordism, and rural to urban migration. In the Red River Delta and many other areas including medium sized urban centres, land conversion to non-agricultural uses is a significant issue. In the highlands, displacement of ethnic minorities has taken a number of forms, from migration of lowlanders to the use of land by state farms. Meanwhile, rapid coastal development, establishment of industrial estates and hydroelectric projects have displaced significant numbers of smallholders from their land.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Environmental governance in the context of climate change and land use is examined with the aim of specifying the conditions under which the incorporation of effective public participation in the governance process can be achieved. This is done through an examination of the preferences of the actors involved, an analysis of the land use issues in climate change governance in Thailand, the extant institutional arrangements for public participation, the difficulties of implementing effective public participation, and possible ways of mitigating these challenges. As climate change governance is a highly problematic arena, successful incorporation of public participation in this sector could point to the potential of extending these conditions into other sectors of environmental governance.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In 2008, three sugar companies were awarded nearly 20,000 hectares of Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) in Oddar Meanchey province. The new research finds that associated land grabbing totaling more than 17,000 hectares has affected more than 2,000 families. Of these, 214 families were forcibly evicted. Meanwhile, at least 3,000 hectares of the misappropriated land has been used for logging rather than sugar plantations, according to the report, ‘Cambodia: The Bitter Taste of Sugar’, commissioned by ActionAid and Oxfam GB. The research focuses on the activities of Angkor Sugar Company, Cambodia Cane and Sugar Valley Company and Tonle Sugar Cane Company. Since 2000, the Royal Government of Cambodia has granted more than 114,000 hectares of land through 19 such sugar concessions. Many of these focus on exports under the European Union’s ‘Everything But Arms’ (EBA) preferential trade scheme.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodia has recently demonstrated one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. While scholars have long explored the drivers of tropical forest loss, the case of Cambodia offers particular insights into the role of the state where transnational governance and regional integration are increasingly the norm. Given the significant role logging rents play in Cambodia’s post-conflict state formation, this article explores the contemporary regime and its ongoing codependent relationship with forested land. Insights are distilled from comparative analysis of illicit logging in two ethnographic case studies. Both involve foreign investments by state-owned companies – a Chinese-backed hydropower dam and Vietnamese- owned rubber concessions – and both are nestled in prominent conservation landscapes that are managed with international donor support. Together, the cases reveal how Cambodia’s current timber extraction regime works through the use and abuse of legal mechanisms associated with forest conservation and foreign investment projects, and the mobilization of elite alliances that log both for private gain and in service of the ruling party’s interests. By implication, the government’s remarkable facilitation of transnational projects for conservation and development must be reappraised and ultimately seen as constitutive of a predatory and extractive regime that continues to rely heavily upon illicit logging revenues.</style>

Many of these forest areas overlap with historical land claims made by Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups who will now permanently lose their land, further enflaming decades-old armed conflicts with the national government. As local communities lose out, wildlife habitat is destroyed and carbon emissions increase, while elite businessmen with strong connections to former Military-state officials profit.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">FIRST PARAGRAPHS OF BOOK CHAPTER: Until recently, studies of economic inequality in Thailand have focused on income rather than wealth, in part because data for analyzing wealth were not available. There have been several attempts to analyze the distribution of landholding, but these were based on partial data as no national database was available. Recently, this situation has changed in two ways. First, in 2006, the regular Socio-Economic Survey that generates the data for analyzing income distribution also collected data on household ownership of assets for the first time. The same data were also collected in 2007 and 2009. Second, the Land Department has computerized its database on titled landholding, and gave access to this team to analyze this data for the first time. Hence, this chapter presents the first-ever analysis of the distribution of land on a national scale based on the record of land titles, along with a summary of the Socio-Economic Survey's findings on the distribution of wealth, and a review of other information on wealth inequality. The analysis of these new data on the distribution of land and of other assets shows that wealth is extremely concentrated in Thailand, even more so than income. This findng has important implications for taxation policy.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This eight-month investigation recorded tonnes of rare timber being trucked out of Cambodia’s national parks and shipped to Hong Kong. Logging of luxury-grade timber is outlawed in Cambodia, and the global trade in Siamese Rosewood has been restricted since 2013, but Chinese demand for antique-style Hongmu furniture is increasing and the illegal trade has ballooned since the ban was announced. During months of interviews with loggers, state officials, police and activists, our investigators kept coming back to one man, who we’ve dubbed the 'King of Rosewood'. Cambodian tycoon Oknha Try Pheap has connections at the highest levels of government and sits at the helm of an illegal logging network that relies on collusion with state officials and enforcement agencies to fell rare trees, traffic logs across the country and load them onto boats bound for Hong Kong. This black market trade is destroying the livelihoods of indigenous and forest-dependent communities. Those who oppose the illegal loggers put their lives on the line. Cambodia’s well-known environmental defender and forest crime investigator Chut Wutty was shot dead in 2012. Six months later journalist Hang Sorei Oudom, who wrote extensively about the elite’s links to illegal forestry, was found dead in the boot of his car. Global Witness is campaigning for a stop to illegal logging in Cambodia and the immediate suspension of all imports of rare Cambodian Hongmu timber by the Peoples Republic of China and Hong Kong officials.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The Bangkok-based Sino-Thai company Choern Pakard Group (CP Group), Asia's largest and most prominent agro-food/feed corporation, has led an industrial maize contract farming scheme with (ex-)poppy upland smallholders in Shan State, northern Myanmar to supply China’s chicken-feed market. Thailand, as a Middle-Income Country (MIC) and regional powerhouse, has long-tapped China’s phenomenal economic growth and undersupplied consumer demand. The study presented demonstrates how changes in multi-scalar political economies and subsequent agro-food/feed systems creates concomitant effects on rural smallholder producers linked into the globalising of production-supply chains. Thailand’s agribusiness sector ‘going out’ aimed to reduce domestic input production costs, supported through neoliberal regional investment and trade policies and crafted behind closed doors by CP executives. Since then, the ethnic minority-populated uplands of Shan State have become a major CP maize production zone for China’s market. This has triggered a historically significant agrarian transformation in Shan State, from low-input subsistence economies to cash cropping of high-input, company-owned seeds for export to foreign markets. The CP maize smallholder production scheme tends to trigger differential socio-economic outcomes and redistribution of wealth within the village. The differential dispossessory outcomes is shaped by differences in village-level household capital, lack of smallholder access to affordable rural finance, ethnic Chinese migrations, and (il)licit border economies tied to Cold War-era politics. The particularity of places, such as differences in their political history, migrations, agro-ecology, geography, and relationship to the opium economy, also influences the dynamics of village- and household-level differentiation of wealth due to CP maize cultivation in Shan State. This paper therefore showcases, through empirical village-level field research, how the corporatisation and regional-/globalisation of the chicken feed market has radically transformed agrarian relations and structures of debt and dispossession in rural, upland Shan State.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The first decade of the new millennium saw a boom in rubber prices. This led to rapid and widespread land conversion to monoculture rubber plantations in continental SE Asia, where natural rubber production has increased &gt;50% since 2000. Here, we analyze the subsequent spread of rubber between 2005 and 2010 in combination with environmental data and reports on rubber plantation performance. We show that rubber has been planted into increasingly sub-optimal environments. Currently, 72% of plantation area is in environmentally marginal zones where reduced yields are likely. An estimated 57% of the area is susceptible to insufficient water availability, erosion, frost, or wind damage, all of which may make long-term rubber production unsustainable. In 2013 typhoons destroyed plantations worth US$&gt;250 million in Vietnam alone, and future climate change is likely to lead to a net exacerbation of environmental marginality for both current and predicted future rubber plantation area. New rubber plantations are also frequently placed on lands that are important for biodiversity conservation and ecological functions. For example, between 2005 and 2010 &gt;2500 km2 of natural tree cover and 610 km2 of protected areas were converted to plantations. Overall, expansion into marginal areas creates potential for loss-loss scenarios: clearing of high-biodiversity value land for economically unsustainable plantations that are poorly adapted to local conditions and alter landscape functions (e.g. hydrology, erosion) – ultimately compromising livelihoods, particularly when rubber prices fall.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In a widely read paper, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank and others propose systematic property rights formalization as a key step in addressing the problems of irresponsible agricultural investment. This paper examines the case of Cambodia, one of a number of countries where systematic land titling and large-scale land concessions have proceeded in parallel in recent years. Cambodia’s experience exemplifies the challenges of the ‘formalization fix’– the proposition that property formalization constitutes a preferable front-line defense against land grabbing – and highlights formalization’s uneven geography as an issue that has yet to generate adequate discussion internationally. Three dimensions of Cambodia’s less-than-successful formalization fix efforts stand out: (1) the spatial separation of systematic land titling and agribusiness concessions that emerged during the 2000s and has only recently begun to be addressed; (2) the deployment of property formalization as a means of land grabbing, especially when applied selectively and unevenly; and (3) the political arena of efforts to legitimize ‘state land’. The paper questions the formalization fix as a policy solution, and argues for both greater spatial transparency in property formalization efforts throughout the global South, and greater attention to the problem of unmapped state land in general.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Dwyer, M.B., 2013. The Formalization Fix?: Land titling, state land concessions, and the politics of geographical transparency in contemporary Cambodia; Research-bas: The article is based on a range of data. In part it draws on maps produced for various formalisation programs including LMAP. It also reviews existing reports on land titling in Cambodia. Primary field data comes from three case studies: an educational booklet for villagers produced by the Ministry of Land Management, observation of a summer school on land management,and a series of donor agency documents. All these materials reinforce particular understandings of non-formalised tenure as state land. The author has extensive experience of similar land issues in Laos, and he conducted this study while based in Cambodia as part of a postdoctoral program at the University of Berne;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: In Cambodia, land grabbing from smallholders has been facilitated by the discursive creation of 80 per cent of the country’s territory as 'state land'. State land becomes a default category that results from the circumscribing of private land by formalisation processes. At the same time, the land grabbing terminology goes through a discursive shift so that small scale encroachers on forests become the 'grabbers' of land that is the property of the state;ZZZ;ZZZ;FDI-rel: Economic land concessions have been granted over an extensive area of Cambodia. Maps show that the ELCs are largely outside those areas in which formal land titling under the LMAP program has been implemented. The creation of the extensive category of 'State land' has facilitated the granting of these concessions, which have displaced many smallholders as the preference for allocation is on already cleared land rather than forested areas;Formalisation-titling-rel: Land titling has been largely in more accessible areas where there are no great threats of expropriation by large scale land concessions. In this sense, titling under the LMAP program has done little to increase land security where it is most under threat. More recent programs, notably the Prime Minister’s leopard skin' approach including the pre-2013 election land titling done by students and social land concessions have been opaque and very limited in scale compared with the size of concessions;ZZZ;ZZZ;Overall-rel: This paper addresses a key issue in the relationship between land titling and other formalisation programs, on the one hand, and security on the other.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Dwyer, M.B., 2013. The Formalization Fix?: Land titling, state land concessions, and the politics of geographical transparency in contemporary Cambodia; Research-bas: The article is based on a range of data. In part it draws on maps produced for various formalisation programs including LMAP. It also reviews existing reports on land titling in Cambodia. Primary field data comes from three case studies: an educational booklet for villagers produced by the Ministry of Land Management, observation of a summer school on land management,and a series of donor agency documents. All these materials reinforce particular understandings of non-formalised tenure as state land. The author has extensive experience of similar land issues in Laos, and he conducted this study while based in Cambodia as part of a postdoctoral program at the University of Berne;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: In Cambodia, land grabbing from smallholders has been facilitated by the discursive creation of 80 per cent of the country’s territory as 'state land'. State land becomes a default category that results from the circumscribing of private land by formalisation processes. At the same time, the land grabbing terminology goes through a discursive shift so that small scale encroachers on forests become the 'grabbers' of land that is the property of the state;ZZZ;ZZZ;FDI-rel: Economic land concessions have been granted over an extensive area of Cambodia. Maps show that the ELCs are largely outside those areas in which formal land titling under the LMAP program has been implemented. The creation of the extensive category of 'State land' has facilitated the granting of these concessions, which have displaced many smallholders as the preference for allocation is on already cleared land rather than forested areas;Formalisation-titling-rel: Land titling has been largely in more accessible areas where there are no great threats of expropriation by large scale land concessions. In this sense, titling under the LMAP program has done little to increase land security where it is most under threat. More recent programs, notably the Prime Minister’s leopard skin' approach including the pre-2013 election land titling done by students and social land concessions have been opaque and very limited in scale compared with the size of concessions;ZZZ;ZZZ;Overall-rel: This paper addresses a key issue in the relationship between land titling and other formalisation programs, on the one hand, and security on the other. This is the process by which titling in some areas implicitly reduces security of tenure in others. The paper takes a geographical approach to the analysis with reference to Cambodia, but it suggests a broader application to the analysis. It employs maps to show how increasing the level of resolution and hence detail of land titling location, and setting titled areas alongside areas where there are large-scale economic land concessions, helps to show how formalisation can miss the target in terms of increasing security for smallholders in the areas vulnerable to land grabbing;Policy-law-rel: Land policy in Cambodia has been based on a two-track system of formalised private tenure for smallholders in more accessible lowland areas and state land on which the government has granted large scale concessions.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: This working paper is an examination of current land formalization processes against the backdrop of Cambodian history and the political economy of land and agrarian change. I... critique the land property right formalisation processes at play under the current land reforms. I present their rationales, mechanisms and influences on Cambodian peasants. I then detail the dynamics of land differentiation in the central rice plain and reveal how it has initiated a large migration to the peripheral uplands. I then go on to show how the contradiction between land appropriation by migrant peasants and the acquisition of large scale economic land concession in the same areas has resulted in irrefutable land issues. We conclude by examining the responses that the government has given to these conflicts in 5 the uplands through the land tiling scheme called Order 01. Finally a number of challenges and issues are presented as research questions or hypotheses for future field researches.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">As Myanmar’s junta prepared to step down from government, the military set about seizing public assets and natural resources to ensure its economic control in a new era of democratic rule. Guns, Cronies and Crops details the collusion at the heart of operations carried out by Myanmar’s armed forces in northeastern Shan State. Large swathes of land were taken from farming communities in the mid-2000s and handed to companies and political associates to develop rubber plantations. Our investigation reveals those involved, including Myanmar’s current Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation, U Myint Hlaing, the country’s ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, and Sein Wut Hmon, a rubber company which collaborated with the former military junta to gain control of land. These revelations come as Myanmar’s government finalises the drafting of a national land policy, the country’s first. The report documents the toxic legacy of these land grabs on an already marginalised ethnic-minority population, for whom little has changed since the country’s much-lauded transition to civil democracy in 2011. Villagers told Global Witness that they had received no compensation and are struggling to earn a living and feed their families without land to grow food. By 2013, 5.3 million acres of land - 35 times the size of Myanmar’s capital Yangon - had been leased to investors for agriculture. More than a quarter of this total is now covered by rubber plantations. As Myanmar’s land is put up for sale after decades of trade sanctions, Global Witness is warning that foreign money risks fuelling human rights violations and playing into the hands of the former dictatorship. The country’s new land policy and subsequent land law present a major opportunity to secure a more equitable future for the country’s citizens, and put an end to the land grabs that are blighting the country’s reform effort.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Myanmar has recently positioned itself as the world’s newest frontier market, while simultaneously undergoing transition to a post-war, neoliberal state. The new Myanmar government has put the country’s land and resources up for sale with the quick passing of market-friendly laws turning land into a commodity. Meanwhile, the Myanmar government has been engaging in a highly contentious national peace process, in an attempt to end one of the world's longest running civil wars. The Myanmar government has aggressively pushed for foreign investment in large-scale private agribusiness concessions through the introduction of a new supportive legal framework, with regional, and to a lesser extent, global corporations signing concession deals, some of which are meant for biofuel production. Meanwhile, REDD+, Readiness, and other similar forest conservation funds have been committed by IFIs and UN agencies, targeting (post-) war high-value conservation forest areas. Climate change mitigation projects and large-scale land deals can instigate conflicts over land and resources, but not just as separate processes occurring in discrete geographies. Working at the intersections of large-scale land acquisitions and climate change mitigation strategies viewed through a landscape perspective, this research project and analytic provides a lens through which to study complex interactions among land-based deals within and across socio-cultural, ecological, conflict and institutional arenas. The Myanmar country case study clearly demonstrates the dynamic interplay of, and the social and ecological spill-over effects from, multiple layers of competing land conflicts — in this case, land grabs and climate change mitigation strategies. These conflicts are firmly embedded in the historical processes, institutional agendas, and environmental particularities in which they take place.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Myanmar’s agricultural sector has for long suffered due to multiplicity of laws and regulations, deficient and degraded infrastructure, poor policies and planning, a chronic lack of credit, and an absence of tenure security for cultivators. These woes negate Myanmar’s bountiful natural endowments and immense agricultural potential, pushing its rural populace towards dire poverty. This review hopes to contribute to the ongoing debate on land issues in Myanmar. It focuses on land tenure issues vis-à-vis rural development and farming communities since reforms in this sector could have a significant impact on farmer innovation and investment in agriculture and livelihood sustainability. Its premise is that land and property rights cannot be understood solely as an administrative or procedural issue, but should be considered part of broader historical, economic, social, and cultural dimensions.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">To disentangle the issue concerning which dimensions of land rights, among security, tradability and pledgeability, affect agricultural outcomes, this paper exploits a unique partial land rights entitlement programme in Thailand, which guarantees only security, allows a limited access to credit, and prohibits any land sale. Based on an instrumental variable strategy, I find that the entitlement increases (1) second rice but not major rice productivity, (2) land use intensity, and leads to changes in (3) land use pattern, (4) land-related investment, and (5) better soil quality. This suggests that security dimension, alone, can play important roles in improving farm activities.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodia is marked by growing inequalities in wealth, reflected by unequal access to land. This is the case despite the redistribution of land in the 1980s based on household size and number of labourers. Cambodia is also characterised by limited formal recognition of land tenure in areas where potential for conflict and dispossession is greatest. In the absence of large-scale land concessions, a degree of land security is afforded by a customary tenure regime that gives farmers possession rights over cultivated land. However, such rights of possession have been insufficient to protect farmers from state sanctioned land grabbing. The granting of large land concessions to powerful actors for agribusiness and resource extraction, as well as smaller scale dispossession and accumulation by local elites, provide the key context for land grabbing and tenure insecurity</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Laos has experienced particularly rapid change from a country which was seen and promoted by its leaders as land-rich and capital-poor, and hence in need of investment, to one with growing land pressures. Among the Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Viet Nam (CLMV) group, Lao features as the country where land issues are most sensitive within the current political system. Openings for dialogue, establishment of effective grievance mech- anisms and ground-based advocacy are most limited in Laos. Land pressures in Laos come from agro-industrial plantations and a large number of hydroelectric dams, mines and infrastructure projects that have been built, are under construction, or are planned. Together these are creating considerable land insecurity, not only among directly affected communities, but also in areas where resettlement schemes are established.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Myanmar is marked by a rapid opening of its economy to foreign investment. This has exacerbated insecurity over land in a country where arbitrary use of authority has troubled smallholders for decades. Close association between the military (which still controls the levers of government), domestic big business and foreign cor- porate interests produces a powerful force for land alienation in a country where the current accelerated development path is largely based on land-demanding projects. These projects include agribusiness plantations, extractives projects in the energy and mining sector, and special economic zones (SEZs). The space for open dialogue and challenges around these issues has opened up rapidly, leaving civil society, government officials and the international community scrambling to stay abreast. Meanwhile, new and complex issues have emerged on top of old problems as neoliberal approaches to turn land into capital see tenure reforms move in the direction of private land titling for smallholder sedentary lowland farmers. In addition, new land and investment-related laws enable foreign capital into land-based deals, particularly for agribusiness.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This report presents a political-economic analysis of land governance at the regional level, focusing on the Mekong Region. The primary emphasis is on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV), but the paper also takes into account the regional role and land governance experiences of Thailand and China. The report is one in a series of reports on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam that present country-level analyses of the poli- tical economy of land governance. The series is part of a research mapping and political-economic analysis conducted by the authors for the Mekong Region Land Governance (MRLG) project, funded by the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ). The initiative is driven by concerns about security of tenure of small- holder farmers, ethnic minorities and women, against a background of land grabbing in various guises (see www. mrlg.org).</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">During Vietnam’s transition from a socialist to a market economy, household’s property rights over agricultural land were considerably strengthened through a land certification program. This resulted in active formal credit and land markets, either of which potentially affects consumption levels and volatility. This article evaluates the program impact with respect to consumption outcomes. In particular, it identifies the channel of impact through which improved property rights affect consumption volatility. We find that land certification increases consumption levels for rural households, but also consumption volatility for a subgroup of households identified by an instrument. We show that the certification program affects consumption outcomes of this subgroup through, presumably more risky, credit-based agricultural investment at the intensive margin.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">To date, REDD+ projects in Laos have made relatively conservative choices on driver engagement, focusing on smallholder-related drivers like shifting cultivation and small-scale agricultural expansion, to the exclusion of drivers like agro-industrial concessions, mining concessions and energy and transportation infrastructure. While these choices have been based on calculated decisions made in the context of project areas, they have created a pair of challenges that REDD+ practitioners must currently confront. The first is lost opportunity. By not engaging industrial drivers of forest loss, REDD+ misses an important chance to engage with high level economic decision making. This has implications not only for climate change mitigation, but more importantly for efforts to make Laoss current trajectory of natural resource-intensive development more socially, environmentally and economically sustainable. The second challenge is more immediate. Due to the political-economic circumstances under which forest loss occurs, there is a significant gap between loss that is planned and loss that can be accounted for under REDDs national circumstance allowances for planned deforestation. This means that REDDs positive impacts on mitigating forest loss, to the extent that they occur, may be swamped by planned but unaccountable forest loss, and thus difficult or impossible to verify. Thinking bigger on issues from driver engagement to spatial planning and concession regulation to land tenure and rural livelihood possibilities thus presents not only a series of opportunities, but a series of imperatives.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article examines changing contexts and emerging processes related to “land grabbing.” In particular, it uses the case of Laos to analyze the driving forces behind land takings, how such drivers are implied in land policies, and how affected people respond depending on their socio-economic assets and political connections. We argue that understanding the multiple strategies farmers use to deal with actual land loss and the risk of losing land is crucial to understanding the hidden effects of land grabbing and its potential consequences for agricultural development and the overall process of agrarian transformation. From a policy perspective, understanding the hidden effects of land grabbing is critical to assess costs and benefits of land concessions, in Laos and elsewhere, especially in relation to current approaches to turn land into capital as a policy strategy to promote economic growth and reduce poverty.</style>

Land Use Policy, 14, 195-202[1].; Overall-rel: This article disaggregates farming households according to socio-economic assets, land holding composition and political connections, to analyse the differential impacts of – and diverse strategies to cope with – land grabbing in Laos. This examination of the differential livelihood responses of farmers in dealing with the effects of land grabbing adds considerable nuance to discussions on how turning land into capital and people into labourers has led to rural impoverishment. In particular, it shows that while land loss has costs for all farmers, those with higher status, wealth and political connections are able to better protect their assets and take advantage of new income opportunities than poorer households of lower status.; Research-bas: The research is based on an in-depth case study of a village in Laos. The data, collected through interviews and a survey of 80 randomly selected households, links farming households’ characteristics (e.g. socio-economic assets, land holding and social/political capital) to strategies pursued to cope with actual or potential land loss at the household level. Fieldwork was conducted in May 2014 and complemented with secondary data including land concession agreements and maps from government agencies.; AgriculturalModernisation-rel: The policy of turning land into capital and farmers into labourers through the concession system is often justified by the government of Laos as necessary in order to “develop” and “modernise” Laos. However, the research finds that household strategies to cope with land dispossession, including finding off farm employment, while often helping to minimise the worst of the impacts, have not improved household food security nor increased household income.; CivilSociety-Donors-rel: While many donor programs aim to improve land governance through law reform, this article shows how the State uses formal law and legal processes to justify land appropriation for production of rubber through the use of concessions. On the other hand, farmers facing land expropriation from companies/the State tend to avoid the use of legal procedures (e.g. land titling) to resist actual or threatened land loss.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: The case study in the article shows that farmers at risk of dispossession have different capabilities/resources/political capital to negotiate the terms of land dispossession. Comparatively wealthy farmers with large landholdings who had previously invested in growing rubber were able to negotiate with the company and the Army Academy (under the Ministry of National Defense) to a temporarily extend their land use rights on land under rubber cultivation. This group of farmers was also better positioned than others to negotiate compensation for lost land/ rubber investments with the company than poorer/lower ranking households. Even so, the article shows that even the better off households who could continue farming experienced loss and faced new financial risks, thus increasing their vulnerability.; FDI-rel: A main plank of the Lao government’s agricultural development strategy since the early 2000s has been to promote foreign direct investment as the major source of funds to turn land into capital and move from subsistence-based to market-oriented agriculture. While this has mostly occurred through land concessions, contract farming has also been promoted by the government as a means of establishing partnerships between investors and farmers geared at sharing responsibilities and benefits. However, the article points to the blurring of boundaries between land concessions and contract farming in Laos, particularly when external capital interests secure control over land and/or labour in the case of the latter.; Policy-law-rel: The article provides a good example of the importance of in-depth village level studies to understand the diversity of local level impacts – and responses to – national land policies such as economic land concessions in order to better assess the costs and benefits of such policies. Particularly revealing in this village level case study, is that the government’s land concession policy and the contract farming policy that adversely incorporated farmers into plantation schemes has reduced rather than improved household food security, particularly for poorer farmers. This stands in direct contravention to the Lao government’s policy of improving household food security through agricultural development.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">PUBLISHER'S DESCRIPTION: This paper reviews the literature on migration within and from rural areas of Southeast Asia to examine the effects of redistribution of labor and remittances on livelihoods and land-use practices, as well as contexts in which migration drives, yet is also driven by, social and environmental change. Gaps in the literature and areas of contention and debate are highlighted, informing an agenda for further research. Many studies approach ways in which labor dynamics and remittances to rural villages affect agricultural productivity among migrant-sending households, or compensate for lost labor by supporting household consumption, but the reality is often found to be a combination of both on the basis of immediate priorities. Perceived returns to investments in both monetary and labor terms are critical to how migration influences household land-use decisions, while initially profitable investments and conducive local conditions are seen to enable successive enhancement and diversification of livelihoods. Overall, the expansive literature relating to migration and development often alludes to, yet stops short of, directly examining migration and remittance effects on land and forest cover change. The literature on land-use change often overlooks or briefly references migration, but migration rarely forms the central point of enquiry. Understanding of the linkages between migration and land-use can be strengthened through spatially situated studies in different geographical settings. Such studies would be better positioned to inform policies relating to land-use, agriculture and forestry in rural regions of Southeast Asia, where multi-local livelihoods are increasingly entwined with globalized processes, including those driving environmental changes that such policies seek to govern.</style>

Since then, the importance of the role that indigenous peoples play in economic, social and environmental conservation through traditional sustainable agricultural practices has been gradually recognized. Consistent with the mandate to eradicate hunger, poverty and malnutrition – and based on the due respect for universal human rights – in August 2010 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations adopted a policy on indigenous and tribal peoples in order to ensure the relevance of its efforts to respect, include, and promote indigenous people’s related issues in its general work. This publication is an outcome of a regional consultation held in Bangkok, Thailand in November 2013. It documents seven case studies which were conducted in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nepal and Thailand to take stock of the changes in livelihood and food security among indigenous shifting cultivation communities in South and Southeast Asia against the backdrop of the rapid socio-economic transformations currently engulfing the region. The case studies identify external – macro-economic, political, legal, policy – and internal – demographic, social, cultural – factors that hinder and facilitate achieving and sustaining livelihood and food security. The case studies also document good practices in adaptive changes among shifting cultivation communities with respect to livelihood and food security, land tenure and natural resource management, and identify intervention measures supporting and promoting good practices in adaptive changes among shifting cultivators in the region.</style>

This study uses publicly available financial and spatial data to examine the geography of land-intensive investment in Southeast Asia, and to identify the limits imposed by problems with data availability. It focuses on three regions where land has been widely seen to be available for new investment: Indonesias outer islands; the development triangle where Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam meet; and the Golden Quadrangle region which comprises the borderlands of northeastern Myanmar, northwestern Laos, southern and western Yunnan, and northern Thailand. These areas are examined in three chapter case studies, each of which uses the currently available spatial data to evaluate trade and investment dynamics in the area  including processes that are used to make land available  and combines these, where possible, with specially commissioned research on investment in key commodity crops to evaluate transparency with respect to financing. In a global and regional context where regulatory change is increasingly being driven by transnational concerns  by consumers, retailers and investors  information systems capable of tracking particular investments spatial targets, and thus their likelihood of various social and environmental outcomes, is increasingly desirable. This study describes current capabilities and challenges to realizing a more complete picture of investors roles in the development of available land.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper documents the opportunities and constraints for the Forest Peoples Land Rights Network (LandNet) in advocating forestland rights, in order to discuss the lessons learned over the previous two decades. Working on the sensitive issue of the struggle over forestland use rights LandNet was able to establish a bottom-up network that includes various stakeholders in this struggle. LandNet is based upon an informal network of motivated forest people established during the work of the three local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who together form the Livelihood Sovereignty Alliance (LISO). LandNet works on issues about forestland use rights at the grassroots of Vietnamese society. Based in six provinces, LandNet is focused on the strengthening of the community by organizing capacity-building activities to make forest people aware of their rights and the duties of government. During these activities as workshops, meetings, and exchange visits LandNet helps to make the community aware of their political, legal, and social capabilities. Creating awareness makes the community confident to ask for, and to protect their rights. Also, by including local authorities as members in its network LandNet has the ability to get directly involved in the decision-making process, and is able to influence this process ensuring that the outcomes will benefit the livelihoods of forest people. Furthermore, LandNet can rely on a large external network of friends and advisors that is used to get advice or information. Lastly, LandNet works as an advisory partner for several national government institutions, and maintains good relationships with journalists. This paper shows two examples of sub-LandNets at the grassroots in Son Kim commune and Hanh Dich commune. Looking at the lessons learned these cases show the importance of a strong community that is aware of the problems in their area, and understands their legal rights and the duties of local authorities. Furthermore, the examples show the importance of a confident community that is willing to speak out during open meetings, and support local authorities representing them in closed meetings. The examples also display the need for LandNet to establish good relationships with local authorities to give them an understanding of the importance of their duties and to ask them to base their decisions upon the law. In conclusion, to strengthen the network, investments by LandNet in human resources will be of great importance. Firstly, as the sheer volume of work increases, they need more people. Secondly, in advocating against the money-driven opponents in the struggle for forestland use rights LandNet needs support in investing in the legal capacity of the network.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">LandNet, 2014. Advocating Forestland Use Rights in Vietnam: Documenting the work of The Forest Peoples Land Rights Network (LandNet); Research-bas: The article is not a research article per se, as it is a self-account of LandNet to illustrate the potentials of advocating for forestland use rights in Vietnam. However, the article uses an evidence base in two case studies from northern central Vietnam. One of the cases, in Ha Tinh, is a grassroots push to devolve management of forest land from ineffective State Forest Enterprises to local communities. The other, in Nghe An, involves resistance to encroachment by a rubber company; AccessToJustice-rel: LandNet uses a rights-based framework to seek justice for forest peoples, as they are termed, whose land and forest access is threatened by illegal actions and abuse of authority. Reference to law is a significant part of LandNet's work, even though most of the legal recourse does not reach the courts. LandNet rather seeks to serve as a bridge between those affected and authorities to be held accountable to the law; ZZZ; CivilSociety-Donors-rel: LandNet works within a civil society framework, making use of openings that are quite recent in Vietnam. It avoids high profile involvement of media in favour of working within the system and within existing legal provisions.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">LandNet, 2014. Advocating Forestland Use Rights in Vietnam: Documenting the work of The Forest Peoples Land Rights Network (LandNet); Research-bas: The article is not a research article per se, as it is a self-account of LandNet to illustrate the potentials of advocating for forestland use rights in Vietnam. However, the article uses an evidence base in two case studies from northern central Vietnam. One of the cases, in Ha Tinh, is a grassroots push to devolve management of forest land from ineffective State Forest Enterprises to local communities. The other, in Nghe An, involves resistance to encroachment by a rubber company; AccessToJustice-rel: LandNet uses a rights-based framework to seek justice for forest peoples, as they are termed, whose land and forest access is threatened by illegal actions and abuse of authority. Reference to law is a significant part of LandNet's work, even though most of the legal recourse does not reach the courts. LandNet rather seeks to serve as a bridge between those affected and authorities to be held accountable to the law; ZZZ; CivilSociety-Donors-rel: LandNet works within a civil society framework, making use of openings that are quite recent in Vietnam. It avoids high profile involvement of media in favour of working within the system and within existing legal provisions.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Successful development experiences have demonstrated the greater efficiency achieved with a growth strategy based on small and medium-scale farmers (SMFs). This study is sought to identify potential agribusiness models for enhancing inclusive growth through NGOs partnerships with SMFs in Myanmar. The paper illustrates that agricultural sector in Myanmar is characterised by already high land inequality and landlessness, and low productivity of most SMFs. Meanwhile, a growing share of land has been allocated to large land concessions with little evidence of growth impacts and significant evidence of social and environmental risks. The document argues that Myanmar needs to build on its most important asset base of its millions of SMFs to jump start economic growth. However, the challenge is how to tap the assets of agribusiness in terms of access to technology, capital, and markets. The paper concludes that: private investment by agribusiness, both small and medium enterprises and larger agribusiness companies, is critical to the realisation of SMFs-based economic growth viable alternative business models rather than land concessions are available to tap agribusiness for wider economic and social benefits (e.g. investment in seed industry) a freeze on awarding further land concessions until a more transparent and equitable process is put in place is highly recommended</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">As trade and investment flows rapidly increase across Southeast Asia, several countries have experienced a surge in large land deals for plantation agriculture. Against this backdrop, civil society organisations have been using a wider range of legal tools to promote public accountability in investment processes. These include scrutinising the negotiation of international treaties, challenging national legal frameworks, raising local awareness about rights, and testing approaches for local consultation and redress. This report distils key lessons gathered from a regional workshop where legal practitioners, civil society groups and academics shared experiences of using different legal tools for accountability in agricultural investments. Together, these experiences illustrate how working across scales and arenas of law, bridging legal and political strategies, and forming strategic alliances can legally empower citizens, build accountability and shape investments for sustainable development. This report has been produced under IIED’s Legal tools for citizen empowerment project.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since the 1990s, Vietnam's progressive integration into the global market economy has triggered major economic and social transformations. In spatial terms, these are marked by a massive conversion of agricultural land for industrial and urban development. While this process has attracted considerable attention from media and researchers, much of the research on land conversion has focused on the largest cities. Little attention is devoted to similar processes occurring in medium-sized cities where urban expansion has been rapidly increasing in recent years. In order to identify the issues and consequences, this paper attempts to analyze how the conversion of farmland for urban uses takes place in the medium-sized city of Hue in Central Vietnam. The analysis shows that land conversion for urban development purposes has increased social tensions and complaints from affected people. Two key issues are identified: i) the state uses its extensive powers in the decision-making process while the participation of affected people is passive and weak; ii) land conversion from agricultural to urban uses results from profit-seeking by multiple stakeholders. Data was collected through fieldwork in Hue and secondary sources such as newspapers, legal documents on land policy and urban development. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE 'APPROACH' SECTION: The national inventory of land purchases and leases in Lao PDR is unique in providing comprehensive in-depth analysis of the extent and impacts of large scale land acquisitions across the country. It represents a major contribution to achieving greater transparency in what has previously been a very opaque field of business, and could serve as a model for other countries. Its major asset is the systematic and spatially-referenced compilation of data on the location, extent and implementation status of land-based investments. These data are useful for the following reasons: • Governments are able to take informed decisions when allocating land for purchase or lease. • The social, economic and ecological impacts of investments are explained. • It is possible to conduct regular monitoring of investment activities and irresponsible companies can be called to account. A scientific baseline is provided for future reference. • Shortcomings in investment policies or land policies are revealed and evidence-based policy-making is enabled.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Agricultural production in Cambodia is concentrated in the northwestern districts bordering Thailand, on the central plains surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake and its river systems, along the Mekong and Bassac rivers towards the Mekong delta, and in the northern and northeastern provinces. In 2012, the total land-use area under major agricultural crops was about 4.015 million ha. Rice is the dominant crop, occupying about 2.968 million ha; non-rice crops are grown on about 1.047 million ha (MAFF 2012). Agricultural lands can be categorised into two distinct topographical regions: lowlands and uplands. Lowland soils mainly support rice farming interspersed with field crops, vegetable gardens, and fruit trees. Upland areas are mainly used for rubber plantations, maize, cassava, soybeans, mungbeans, peanuts, sesame, sugarcane, and fruit trees (MAFF 2012). Since knowledge about the biophysical constraints of upland soils remains limited and because Cambodian agriculture is heavily dependent on productivity of rainfed, lowland, rice-based farming systems, this policy brief focuses on crop and land management in the lowland.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper presents the case of World Bank support to the mass titling component of the Cambodia Land Management and Administration Project. This was a project for which there was clear national demand, as evidenced by the fact that the Cambodian government had already attempted to implement mass titling a decade previously, but had lacked the human and technical resources to complete it. The case describes a consensus between donors and a host nation government during the planning and approval of the intervention, which dissolves into conflict during implementation. Ultimately, the case raises questions about the ethics of intervention. When governments want approximately the rules of the game suggested by donors (functioning institutions to facilitate markets) but do not want a level playing field, how should this be understood and resolved? Must donors always be passively complicit in elite projects until domestic politics hold them accountable to their own rules?</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The concepts of degraded forest (pa mai xout xom) and degraded land (din seuam xom) have been variously applied in official Lao government policy narratives and law over the last couple of decades. In this article I focus on the concepts of degraded forest and land, and the relationship with industrial tree plantations, using two examples from southern Laos. I argue that the concepts have been significant in both facilitating and obstructing the development of large-scale industrial tree plantations in different times and spaces, thus significantly influencing access and exclusion, as well as the spatialization of tree plantations. I provide a tentative genealogy regarding the emergence of these concepts in land and forestry policy in Laos, and briefly explain the links between degradation and ‘the land rush’ presently affecting Laos.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This report deals with land concessions in Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Thailand – a much contended topic which leads discussants from issues such as land ownership and utilization to social structures, human rights and beyond. Overall, this report aims to examine changes in relative competitiveness in selected tradable commodities of Thailand and whether they are impacted through increases of land concession in selected countries in the subregion. To provide its readers with a deeper understanding of land concessions, this report assesses the current state of concessions in the aforementioned countries and analyses the legislative frameworks enabling the concessions. From there, focus of the report is narrowed on the impacts of land concessions on the production of certain goods, namely rice, rubber and sugar. In particular, the report examines whether land concessions affect how these commodities are traded. The social and economic impacts of land concessions are examined alongside the impacts on productivity wherever possible.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The type of agrarian structure employed to produce tropical commodities affects many dimensions of land use, such as ownership inequality, overlapping land rights and conflicts, and land use changes. I conduct a literature review of historical changes in agrarian structures of commodities grown on the upland frontier of mainland Southeast and South Asia, using a case study approach, of tea, rubber, oil palm and cassava. Although the production of all these commodities was initiated in the colonial period on large plantations, over the course of the 20th century, most transited to smallholder systems. Two groups of factors are posited to explain this evolution. First, economic fundamentals related to processing methods and pioneering costs and risks sometimes favored large-scale plantations. Second, policy biases and development paradigms often strongly favored plantations and discriminated against smallholders in the colonial states, especially provision of cheap land and labor. However, beginning after World War I and accelerating after independence, the factors that propped up plantations changed so that by the end of the 20th century, smallholders overwhelmingly dominated perennial crop exports, except possibly oil palm. Surprisingly, in the 21st century there has been a resurgence of investments in plantation agriculture in the frontier countries of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, driven by very similar factors to a century ago, especially access to cheap land combined with high commodity prices. As in the last century, this may be a temporary aberration from the long-run trend toward smallholders, but much depends on local political economy.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Foreign investment in agriculture and extractive industries is increasing pressures on land and natural resources. This handbook is about how to use law to make foreign investment work for sustainable development. It aims to provide a rigorous yet accessible analysis of the law regulating foreign investment in low and middle-income countries – what this law is, how it works, and how to use it most effectively. Because several legal arenas are relevant to any given investment project, the handbook takes an integrated approach that cuts across areas of law typically treated in separate literatures – including investment treaties, extractive industry legislation, land tenure, human rights, environmental legislation and tax law. For both government and civil society, the strategic use of a variety of legal tools is critical in harnessing the full potential of law. This book aims to support government officials in low and middle-income countries in their management of foreign investment for sustainable development, and to support civil society efforts to influence decisions and hold government and investors to account. This handbook has been produced under IIED’s Legal tools for citizen empowerment project.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In this report, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) outlines the findings of its recent survey of households forcibly displaced by the Thilawa Special Economic Zone development project in Burma. The Japanese government and three Japanese companies partnered with the Burmese government and a consortium of Burmese companies to develop the site, a project that will require the relocation of nearly 1,000 families in total. PHR’s findings cover phase one of the project, during which 68 households were displaced. PHR performed a survey of 29 of these households and conducted 22 key informant interviews. PHR found that the displacement process fell significantly short of meeting international guidelines, most notably because the residents felt threatened by the government with lawsuits and imprisonment if they did not move. The displacement process in Thilawa violated residents’ human rights, negatively affected their ability to provide for themselves, and resulted in deteriorating food security and limited ability to access health care. The small community PHR sampled during this survey serves as a harbinger of adverse consequences for the additional 846 households that will be displaced during phase two of the Thilawa project. Unless the governments of Japan and Burma achieve a standard of practice consonant with their stated commitment to international norms and guidelines, these 846 households will very likely suffer a fate similar to those affected during phase one.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Gittleman, A. and Brown, W., 2014. A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma: Forced Displacement in the Thilawa Special Economic Zone; Research-bas: The report is based on a survey of 29 households, including both questionnaires and anthropometric measurement. The questionnaire overed health status, food security, access to healthcare, changes in income and livelihoods, and transparency of the displacement process. The survey employed tested and validated instruments, and it followed strict protocols with regard to survey ethics. Results are displayed clearly in a number of diagrams, tables and charts at the end of the report;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Industrial estates and export processing zones are just one of may types of project in Myanmar that lead to dispossession in the name of economic development. Dispossession is permissible under international guidelines for projects that are in the public interest, so long as alternatives have been explored and strict guidelines are followed. In the case of Thilawa Special Economic Zone, there is little evidence that due process has been followed. The great majority of those affected are worse off now in every respect than before they were displaced. This is reflected in a high rate of malnutrition, greatly diminished income and other indicators;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;MarginalisedPeople-rel: Those affected by Thilawa Special Economic Zone are small scale farmers. They were not informed of social and economic assessments of the project, nor did they have recourse to legal processes. About 30 percent are of Indian origin and do not read Burmese, yet they have been compelled to rely on Burmese language materials and to sign documents related to their land expropriation. Despite being only 25 kilometers from the country’s main city, Yangon, those affected have been marginalised by the process of displacement;ZZZ;Overall-rel: The Thilawa Special Economic Zone is a case in point of Myanmar’s opening to foreign investment in the absence of effective safeguards for those displaced by new economic activity. This report takes the case of a Japan-supported industrial zone 25km south of Yangon to examine the conditions of farmers who have lost their land to the first phase of the project.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Gittleman, A. and Brown, W., 2014. A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma: Forced Displacement in the Thilawa Special Economic Zone; Research-bas: The report is based on a survey of 29 households, including both questionnaires and anthropometric measurement. The questionnaire overed health status, food security, access to healthcare, changes in income and livelihoods, and transparency of the displacement process. The survey employed tested and validated instruments, and it followed strict protocols with regard to survey ethics. Results are displayed clearly in a number of diagrams, tables and charts at the end of the report;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Industrial estates and export processing zones are just one of may types of project in Myanmar that lead to dispossession in the name of economic development. Dispossession is permissible under international guidelines for projects that are in the public interest, so long as alternatives have been explored and strict guidelines are followed. In the case of Thilawa Special Economic Zone, there is little evidence that due process has been followed. The great majority of those affected are worse off now in every respect than before they were displaced. This is reflected in a high rate of malnutrition, greatly diminished income and other indicators;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;MarginalisedPeople-rel: Those affected by Thilawa Special Economic Zone are small scale farmers. They were not informed of social and economic assessments of the project, nor did they have recourse to legal processes. About 30 percent are of Indian origin and do not read Burmese, yet they have been compelled to rely on Burmese language materials and to sign documents related to their land expropriation. Despite being only 25 kilometers from the country’s main city, Yangon, those affected have been marginalised by the process of displacement;ZZZ;Overall-rel: The Thilawa Special Economic Zone is a case in point of Myanmar’s opening to foreign investment in the absence of effective safeguards for those displaced by new economic activity. This report takes the case of a Japan-supported industrial zone 25km south of Yangon to examine the conditions of farmers who have lost their land to the first phase of the project. By taking a food and nutrition based approach to measurement, the organisation Physicians for Human Rights have produced hard measurement of the impoverishment resulting from such displacement; Policy-law-rel: The Thilawa Special Economic Zone involves international cooperation from Japan and is a high profile project. Despite this, safeguards do not appear to have helped reduce the impoverishment that resulted from displacement.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">PUBLISHER'S ABSTRACT: Though Vietnam’s Forest Land Allocation (FLA) policies have been in effect for more than a decade, a systematic assessment of FLA impacts on forest resources and the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities has never been carried out. This report shows that forest land allocated to households tends to be used efficiently in protected areas, whereas land allocated to forest companies generally fails to generate positive outcomes. Common problems are excessive land clearance for collection of land leasing fees, land conflicts between forest companies and local people, and local people lacking sufficient agro-forestry land to meet livelihood needs. State-forest enterprises or forest companies have been prioritized in the allocation of land use rights, which has decreased the area of forest land stocks available to households and individuals. Almost 300,000 households lack sufficient land; meanwhile, more than 2 million hectares of forestland currently managed by local Commune’s People Committees is under poor management. The authors recommend that steps be taken to decentralize natural resource use and management, not only through policy but also through direct on-the-ground mechanisms that promote livelihood opportunities.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The dramatic expansion of large-scale economic land concessions and acquisitions in the Global South has generated considerable concern amongst activists, journalists and academics recently. This has led to the increased prevalence of the term ‘global land grabbing’, which I argue represents a particular type of meta- narrative. In this article the global land grab meta-narrative is considered in relation to recent land alienation of Indigenous Peoples in the northeastern Cambodia province of Ratanakiri. While land grabbing is certainly a crucial problem, it is insufficient to explain the circumstances in Ratanakiri or in Cambodia more generally as ‘global land grabbing’. While foreign capital is associated with land grabbing in Cambodia, there are various other factors that also require consideration. Specifically, the role of Asian money laundering and elite capture requires increased attention. This article contributes to better understanding the particular ways that land dispossession plays out in particular places and contexts.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM OPENING PARAGRAPHS: Land confiscation is one of the leading causes of protest and unrest in Burma, having led to the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in recent years. It also undermines Burma’s fragile peace processes. The 2008 constitution and subsequent laws are used to legitimize arbitrary land confiscation, deny access to justice, and perpetuate an environment of impunity. Land confiscation for profitable large-scale development and commercial projects enrich the military, state-owned enterprises, and regime cronies, but result in the loss of livelihood and human rights abuses for local communities. Land confiscation often involves violence, resulting in grievous injury, to force people off their land, or to suppress resistance to land confiscation. Benefiting from land grabs, linked in some cases to ethnic cleansing or war atrocities, poses a risk to foreign investors and increases their exposure to judicial claims. Prevailing censorship and other institutional obstructions hinder access to accurate information required for due diligence processes. It is in the interests of the international corporate community to ensure that legislative and institution reforms include equitable and transparent land acquisition procedures and measures to protect communities from impunity.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: According to the HEKS strategy 2013 – 2017, access to land is an area of expertise for the organization. Land can be closely linked to both HEKS’ action strategy of Development for Rural Communities and Conflict Transformation. Within the development cycle for rural communities, access to resources is a precondition for sustainable development of rural areas. But land can also become a source of conflict, or a political tool to include/exclude, hence affecting PooC opportunities to participate in society. Furthermore, where land rights are under pressure, right holders and duty bearers are put to the test whether they are able to claim or protect the rights necessary for people to live in dignity from a rights- based perspective. In figure 1, poor functioning of this interaction was identified as one of root causes for land conflicts in Cambodia. The work of HEKS Cambodia, and its 4 national partner NGOs and 2 supported Provincial Departments of Agriculture (PDA), is mainly focused on the Development of Rural Communities. In July 2014, HEKS started a pilot with a new partner (ACT) to develop a project in the area of Conflict Transformation. ACT is currently involved in an assessment to identify conflicts to work on in a 3-year phase. It is expected that conflicts over land will be identified as one of the biggest obstacles to people’s livelihoods. However, proper information related to land ownership and land issues for HEKS’ current intervention areas in Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu, Prey Veng (new target villages) and Pursat provinces is currently lacking. It was therefore decided to do a short land study, which could be the starting point to develop new interventions on land and conflict transformation. Systematic information on land would also enhance HEKS’ understanding of its impact on a broader level on community livelihoods. This study was designed to provide such information for HEKS Cambodia. 2.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Rural change in Cambodia manifests itself in rapidly declining land availability for the smallholder sector, posing the question of how farmers may be able to deal with limited access to land. In this paper, we discuss with a case study village and household livelihood strategies of smallholders currently operating under land-constrained conditions. Based on an integrated assessment of a smallholder village in Kampot province, we illustrate in quantitative terms how land shortage is creating problems of surplus generation and liquidity issues in monetary and non-monetary flows. At the household level, livelihood diversification based on the involvement of productive resources other than land may play an increasing role, particularly in the future, when levels of land shortage may increase. At the village level, smallholder may respond through institutional innovation, in particular through the establishment of a community banking system and a paddy rice bank to provide money and rice credits to overcome transitory shortages and to cover investment costs for additional productive resources. Thus, in this case, we observe the emergence of new patterns of livelihood in rural areas, based on the integration of non-land-based economic activities and new institutional settings.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Vietnam’s 1993 Land Law created a land market by granting households land-use rights which could be exchanged, leased, inherited, sold or mortgaged. This study uses quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze whether increased land titling led to discernible improvements in the economic security of households, and whether land titles in women’s names had markedly different effects as compared to titles held by men. Using a matched sample of households from Vietnam’s 2004 and 2008 Household Living Standards Survey, we find that on balance, land-use rights held exclusively by women or jointly by couples result in several beneficial effects including increased household expenditures and women’s self-employment, and lower household vulnerability to poverty. Titles held by men have statistically significant impacts on their probability of self-employment in agriculture and on food poverty. Results from interviews conducted in Vietnam support these conclusions with evidence that the main channel through which women’s ownership of land rights mattered is increased bargaining power in the home.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: In May 2012 Prime Minister Hun Sen issued Directive 001 (also known as Order 01BB) on ‘Measures to strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of management of economic land concessions (ELCs)’ announcing a moratorium on the granting of new ELCs, the review of existing ELCs and the implementation of the so-called “leopard- skin” (or “tiger-skin”) policy, with the aim to allow communities to live side by side with the concessions. In the framework of the implementation of Directive 001, a new land registration campaign was implemented by youth volunteers to speed up the process of land registration, which had been previously carried out, often ineffectually, through sporadic or systematic registration systems. After the issuance of Directive 001, the number of newly granted ELCs dropped dramatically. While in 2012 at least 2,657,470 hectares of land was granted to private companies1 , in 2013 no new ELCs were issued. On the contrary, government sources reported that more than 330,000 hectares have been seized from ELCs in order to be redistributed to the people2 . However, the terminology used in Directive 001, which “provisionally” suspends the granting of new ELCs, is concerning. This suggests the government’s lack of engagement in a long-term commitment to the suspension of ELCs, allowing the granting of ELCs to be resumed at any time. Moreover, issues relating to existing ELCs have not been addressed, especially with regard to the disclosure of comprehensive information on ELCs. This is problematic when assessing the effectiveness of the implementation of Directive 001 as it is difficult to determine whether the government effectively complied with point iii) of the directive, which states that the government “shall seize ELCs where companies/concessionaires that have already been given agreement from the Royal Government of Cambodia have not complied with the existing legal procedure or contractual obligations3 ”. Despite the reduction of newly granted ELCs, in 2013 ADHOC registered 29 land dispute cases related to ELCs4 , the majority of which were concentrated in north-eastern Cambodia, where rubber and other cash crops are commonly grown. In 2013, according to data collected by ADHOC, 485 Social Land Concessions (SLCs) were granted for a total of 626,823.26 hectares, against the 38 SLCs totalling 100,790 hectares granted in 2012. The government reclassified and donated land to the rural poor over the course of 2013 with a peak in the first six months of the year, coinciding with the run-up to the election on 28 July 2013, which cast a shadow over the government’s efforts as it indicates the policy was executed for political gains. Indeed, out of 485 Sub- Decrees, 429 were issued between January and June 2013, while only 56 between July and December5 . In the month prior to the National Election, a record number of 159 SLCs (averagely 5.3 per day) was reached. Moreover, there is concern that measures taken to implement the SLC policy could actually worsen the situation for vulnerable families and aggravate landlessness as corruption, mismanagement and serious abuses have been reported in relation to SLCs. Firstly, procedures and criteria set out in the Sub- Decree 19 on SLCs have often been disregarded, in particular with regard to community consultations, with the result that in several cases land transferred to SLCs was already claimed by other people or was already in the process of being registered as Indigenous People’s (IPs) collective land. Secondly, given that more than 60 per cent of the arable land in Cambodia is concentrated in the hands of private companies, land available for re-distribution is limited. As a consequence, large portions of forest covered areas, including protected areas and wildlife sanctuaries– already heavily encroached by ELCs and illegal logging activities – have been re-classified as state private land in order to provide ownership to citizens6 . Moreover, it is difficult to assess whether the land has effectively been redistributed to the people or if these SLCs exist only on paper. A study should be conducted in order to assess whether the land actually reached the target recipients, and impacts of SLCs on local residents should be further analysed.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM INTRODUCTION: Many of the economic, demographic, and social changes animating land disputes in Vietnam are also sweeping across other countries in East Asia. The aim of this Report is to provide comparative insights into land-taking disputes in three East Asian countries—China, Indonesia, and Cambodia—that are relevant to Vietnamese conditions. It is not the intention of this Report to provide a comprehensive account of land-taking disputes, but rather to identify trends in dispute resolution. This Report concludes that land tenure reforms are useful in providing clarity about ownership. However without competent land titling and registration agencies and courts, land tenure reforms cannot resolve the underlying conflicts about access to scarce resources. Similarly, institutional reforms have proved ineffective in resolving land disputes unless they level the playing field between state agencies, land users, and developers. Attempts by governments in the region to suppress land disputes have pushed grievances underground, leading in the long-term to more deep-seated and intractable conflicts.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodia is engaged in profound societal and economic changes usually referred to as “agrarian transition”. The agrarian transition involves three main trends: that of migration within the rural areas and from rural to urban areas; that of change within the rural society from a mainly land owning population of small peasant farmers to one in which a substantial number of the population are landless workers; and the transformations of the society from primarily non-urban populations dependent upon agricultural production and organized through rural social structures to an urbanized industrialized and market-based society (De Koninck 2008). In the context of population growth, a key challenge of this transition is the creation of productive jobs that can keep pace with the annual increase of growth in the annual labor force, which in Cambodia is estimated to be between 250,000 and 300,000 (Chan 2009). The transformations don’t follow a linear path but are shaped by upheavals and contradictions. A process central to this agrarian transition, is the urbanization and industrialization of the country, manifested by the increased share of industries and services in the GDP structure and in the national labor force (Lundström and Ronnas 2006). Another important aspect is the intensification and/or the expansion of agricultural land by taking advantage of the natural endowment of forest areas that could be harnessed for colonization (De Koninck 2008; Pilgrim, et. al. 2012). Both of these evolutions suggest the increased mobility of population and its redistribution through migrations, both within and beyond national borders.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The challenges of householding across time and space inevitably strain marital roles and relationships, as well as providing temptations and opportunities for sexual infidelity, and is assumed to increase the propensity for marital breakdown. This paper raises questions about the assumed relationship between migration and marital disruption through qualitative evidence from Vietnam. We focus on 14 men and women migrants with disrupted marriages in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. We explore their interpretations of the breakdown of their marriages and the role that migration played within this. Long-standing views in Vietnam prioritise the creation and sustaining of household-level social processes over and above couple's intimacy and emotional relationship and these are highly resilient in the face of extended spousal separation. At the same time, though, some men and some women actively choose to disrupt their marriages where expectations about intimacy, fidelity, and obligations for provisioning and care were not met. We argue that migration plays into experiences of marital disruption in highly divergent ways and experiences of marital disruption and migration are more subtly gendered than is commonly portrayed. In doing so, we seek to contribute to both the literature on householding and to policy thinking about responses to migration. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Part 4: During the transition, businesses, government and development partners need to take steps to fill the existing gaps in Myanmar’s legislative framework on the protection of the environment, society and human rights . The Government has an immediate and important opportunity in the new production sharing contracts to fill these gaps through contractual requirements to meet the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards and World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines. To ensure a level playing field, the Government should impose the same requirements on all opera tors and not just new entrants. Companies should publicly commit to operating to the se international standards. The Government has made a commitment to high environmental and social standards in its 2012 Framework for Economic and Social Reforms . But if there are neither relevant domestic laws nor contractual requirements to these standards , the environmental and social costs of O&amp;G operations risk being externalised on local populations, with workers and local communities bearing the brunt of any envi ronmental and social harms with little or no accountability for the companies operating in the sector . Development partners have an important role to play in supporting the Myanmar Government’s current regulatory and enforcement capacity, as well as sup porting the emergence of robust national legislation to fill these gaps in the future. They also have a role to play as home governments to companies operating in Myanmar, exercising their leverage over companies from their jurisdiction to meet internatio nal standards of responsible business conduct.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This report provides an overview of state and regional governments’ roles in natural resource governance, highlighting the mining, oil and gas, timber, and hydropower sectors. This report is the fourth volume in the Subnational Governance in Myanmar Discussion Paper Series, which aims to inform future analysis of the potential risks and benefits of changes to the role of subnational governments. This report is funded by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID). From February to May 2014, researchers interviewed civil society members, political parties, subnational government officials, and business associations in Kachin and Shan States, and central-level ministries in Naypyitaw, in order to address the following questions: What are the current roles of national and subnational government in natural resource management and revenue flows in Myanmar? What discussions of natural resource wealth sharing are now taking place? What are the potential benefits, risks, and economic trade-offs involved? U Win Min, Senior Research Fellow at MDRI-CESD says, “The considerations presented in this report are crucial for the future of resource sharing, a key component of the national reconstruction process.” With wealth-sharing discussions still in an early stage, the report says that stakeholders should consider important questions about ‘which goals wealth-sharing policies would be intended to address, and the transparency, sustainability, and distributional effects of the systems they might create.’ In Myanmar, the Foundation works with partners in government, the private sector, and civil society to build the country’s capacity for regional integration, strengthen the core institutions and processes of democratic governance, and support increased access to information</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In much of Southeast Asia, the rise of rural land conflicts and struggles often parallels market expansion into frontiers, a collage of historical state interventions, negotiations over state authority and contested legitimacy. Scholarship on Vietnam has yielded important insights on the changes wrought by new commodity booms and hybrid forms of state engagement in markets. With the recent escalation of land conflict between Vietnam's State ForestCompanies (SFCs) andfarmers, thispaperbuilds onpast researchtoexaminewhy this cur- rent wave of SFC–farmer conflict is occurring, and what it means for the relationships between SFCs, farming communities and the central state. Based on our analysis of two sites of intense conflict, we argue that changes to SFC governance, together with rapidly evolving commodity markets and livelihood pressures are bringing a newedge to land negotiations. Policy changes that aimed to improve the efficiency of Vietnam's state companies have transformed SFCs fromstate-run businesses into hybrid state-private entities that are required to sustain a profit. Yet SFCs' ongoing connection with the state ensures their continued control of valuable forestlands, and emboldens SFCs to flout state rules tomonopolize land and engage local farmers in exploitative ‘tenancy’ con- tracts. For farmers, the SFC has changed fromthe local ‘face’ of the state, that heavily exploited timber, restricted local forest access and provided somelocal infrastructure andservices, to a privilegedmarket actor bent on profit. This situation has intensifiedwith growing local demand for land to sustain livelihoods and to feed Chinese and global demand for cassava and softwood.While Vietnamesemarkets continue to reflect a strong state hand,we show that SFCs' hybrid identity as both a state and market actor poses new risks for the central state. When farmers openly challenge SFCs over land and reference colonial arrangements through the language of a ‘new landlord’, they question the legitimacy and role of the state in the face of new market pressures and opportunities.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This report aims to provide its readers with quick and easy access to the key findings and recommendations of the conducted study. It therefore focuses mainly on giving summaries and conclusions, and provides as little pre-analysis material as necessary within the report as such. All data summarized in tables and figures are provided in the annex. The report is structured along the research topics of the study: 1. Participation structures in PLUP and VDP 2. Impacts and benefits of PLUP and VDP 3. Methodology of PLUP and VDP Background. The study was conducted for two purposes: 1. To review activities supported by the German Government, implemented by GIZ as support to the Lao NUDP. The report reviews key indicators of the first phase of the German contribution. 2. To provide recommendations for the ongoing German contribution and the overall NUDP, and use these recommendations to further tailor activities to the actual needs of the target groups. Key questions behind this study were: Why does local participation matter? How and to what degree can District staff promote local participation? What are key issues behind lacking participation which the NUDP can address? Which benefits from PLUP and VDP can we observe so far? Did we do the right things – and did we do these things right - What do we learn for the future</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over the past 15 years, northwest Cambodia has seen dramatic agrarian expansion away from the central rice plain into the peripheral uplands fuelled by peasant in-migration. Against this background, we examine the nature of relations between the peasantry and the state. We first show the historical continuities of land control processes and how the use of violence in a post-conflict neoliberal context has legitimised ex-Khmer Rouge in controlling land distribution. Three case studies show the heterogeneity of local level sovereignties, which engage the peasants in different relations with authority. We examine how these processes result in the construction of different rural territories along the agricultural frontier and argue that, in this region of Cambodia, the struggles between Khmer Rouge and neoliberal modes of land control are central to state formation processes.</style>

The Journal of Peasant Studies, 41(4): 445-468.; Overall-rel: This article provides a rich historical account of the evolving political economy of land relations in northwest Cambodia. The authors demonstrate how historical processes and events specific to northwest Cambodia have shaped contemporary patterns of land control and given rise to an extractive agrarian political economy based on networks developed by Khmer Rouge (KR) and Thai actors across the border. These historical processes include: the emergence of the northwest as the cradle of KR uprising; the development of business relationships between the KR and Thai military logging companies based on granting forest concessions; the post-1997 policy for reintegration of the KR which gave KR warlords and solders substantial power in land management in the northwest; and the continuity of business relations between ex-KR warlords/soldiers (now in position of political and economic power) and Thai agribusiness companies stimulated by international agro-industrial markets. While violent post-war political settlement and land distribution by KR warlords have been forces shaping patterns of authority and land control in northwest Cambodia, peasant resistance has also been an important factor shaping local land control practices.; Research-bas: The article draws on a rich literature review on Cambodian history, including primary documents from archives dating back to the colonial period and doctoral dissertations from Khmer Rouge leaders. The analysis of local land control is based on fieldwork carried out by the authors in the Bavel District, Battambang province, northwest Cambodia. This includes field observations and discussions with local authorities through the authors’ participation in a series of spatial planning workshops, as well as detailed ethnographic research conducted in three villages which make up the case studies in the article.; AgriculturalModernisation-rel: Land and capital concentration in northwest Cambodia have resulted from land distribution processes controlled by KR elites and, later, market-driven land acquisitions that led to peasant indebtedness and land sales. The resulting increase in agricultural wage labour is a key defining feature of agrarian transformation in northwest Cambodia.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: The article complicates the notion of marginalisation by shining the spotlight on actors and processes we don’t usually think of as main culprits or drivers of dispossession. In this case, processes of exclusion have been driven by former Khmer Rouge leaders, thanks to the policy of reintegration introduced by the government after the 1997 elections, which that gave Khmer Rouge warlords and soldiers the authority to distribute and manage land in northwest Cambodia. The land distribution process strongly favoured high-ranking Khmer Rouge officers and those with closest connections to them. This legacy has resulted in highly unequal patterns of land distribution and authority, with selected families becoming powerful interlocutors of transnational agri-businesses networks. These land enclosures imposed by KR elite have not gone uncontested, as shown in an example where peasants mobilised against KR legacy over a piece of land on a warlord landholding. Nevertheless, peasant mobilisations are shown by the authors to follow opportunistic behaviour that follow rules set by authorities that serve the interests of elites and markets.; MigrationLabour-rel: The agrarian expansion away from the central rice plain into the peripheral uplands fuelled by peasant in-migration features in most ethnographies of land acquisition in Cambodia. In the case of northwest Cambodia, the policy of reintegration and land distribution to demobilised soldiers and migrant peasants opened considerable tracts of land suitable for cultivation and created incentives for migration. Through extended family networks linked to demobilised soldiers, peasants in need of land arrived from all parts of the country, particularly from neighbouring districts and the southwest. Successive waves of migrant farmers have colonised land increasingly located at the peripheries and brought with them an important labour force.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper uses household panel data from rural Vietnam to explore the effects of having a relative in a position of political or bureaucratic power. Our results suggest that households increase their investment in land improvements due to such ties. Likely explanations are that connections to office holders strengthen de facto land property rights and access to both credit and transfers. Results also indicate that officials prefer to use informal rather than formal channels of redistribution to relatives.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since holding elections in 2010, Myanmar has transitioned from a direct military dictatorship to a formally democratic system and has embarked on a period of rapid economic reform. After two decades of military rule, the pace of change has startled almost everyone and led to a great deal of cautious optimism. To make sense of the transition and assess the case for optimism, this article explores the political economy of Myanmar’s dual transition from state socialism to capitalism and from dictatorship to democracy. It analyses changes within Myanmar society from a critical political economy perspective in order to both situate these developments within broader regional trends and to evaluate the country’s current trajectory. In particular, the emergence of state-mediated capitalism and politico-business complexes in Myanmar’s borderlands are emphasised. These dynamics, which have empowered a narrow oligarchy, are less likely to be undone by the reform process than to fundamentally shape the contours of reform. Consequently, Myanmar’s future may not be unlike those of other Southeast Asian states that have experienced similar developmental trajectories.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">On 18 October 2014 the Myanmar government released a much-awaited draft national land use policy. Land and how it is governed is of fundamental importance for Myanmar society. The current laws mainly benefit private companies and not small-holder farmers in the country, who represent more then 75% of the population. The current laws also do not respect traditional and customary practices of the country's ethnic minority groups. This new TNI briefing examines the draft national land policy and assesses whether it is pro-business or pro-poor.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The Qualitative Social and Economic Monitoring of Livelihoods in Myanmar (QSEM) research program provides a descriptive picture of rural life in Myanmar. It examines people’s livelihood strategies and activities, the wider factors that shape these strategies and how the broader social and institutional features of community life affect people’s livelihood choices and outcomes.The research covers 54 villages in six states and regions covering the different agro‐ecological zones where LIFT operates: (i) the dry zone (Magway and Mandalay regions); (ii) coastal zones (Rakhine State and Ayeyarwady Region); and (iii) hilly zones (Chin and Shan states). This report documents findings from the fourth round of research, which took place between March and May 2014.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Recently concerns have been raised regarding the potential for the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) framework to recentralize forests, potentially setting back efforts to institute localized and decentralized forms of natural resource management. Here, I apply a political ecology approach to consider access and exclusion to land and natural resources in the contexts of three emerging REDD projects in Cambodia and Laos. I argue that each represents either a partial, incomplete, or so far unfulfilled.but nevertheless useful.example of efforts to use REDD to strengthen local resource tenure. Thus, it is possible to envision how REDD could be utilized to leverage decentralized forest tenure, even if such a reality seems far away at present.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper discusses Cambodia’s legal framework relating to Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) and looks at the implementation gaps. It argues that despite Cambodian’s legal framework governing land and ELCs being well- developed, its social benefits, such as protecting the rights of the poor and vulnerable and contributing to transparency and accountability, are almost non-existent. Recent evidence suggests that the Government’s handling of nat- ural resources is a far cry from its official land policy which is “to administer, manage, use and distribute land in an equitable, transparent, efficient, and sustainable manner”. This paper argues that this is due to (1) a large gap between the country’s legal framework and the implementation of the country’s land concession policies and (2) a complete disregard of the country’s customary land rights. Widespread corruption and nepotism encourages growing inequality in land ownership and a significant power imbalance between small groups of powerful, politically and economically well-connected elites and poor and vul- nerable people in Cambodia. This is exacerbated by the lack of implementation of appropriate regulations. This elite exercises control over the judiciary and has created a climate of impunity, thus hindering the overall implementation of the legal framework and serving their own interests. The paper further looks into recent Government actions such as the moratorium on ELCs and a new land titling initiative to re-allocate ELC area and forestland to the rural poor and assesses whether these actions have the potential to reverse or perpetuate the current inequality in land holdings.</style>

The project overall objective is to contribute to enhance resilience of rainfed farmers of Lower Mekong River Basin countries confronting climate change. The project idea seeks to stimulate local innovation using SRI and Farmers’ Field School (FFS) approaches involving smallholder farmers in rainfed areas of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand in order to sustainably improve agricultural productivity and food security in the context of climate change adaptation, and to enhance research capacities to continue to support this development.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Recent research has emphasized the role of land tenure in influencing rural food and nutrition insecurity in developing countries. We use data from rural Myanmar to empirically analyze the links between land holdings and household level food and nutrition security. Our analysis focuses on the following issues: (i) what are the socio-economic characteristics of food insecure households?, (ii) what are the main coping strategies adopted by vulnerable households to address their food security?, and (iii) are our findings robust across the different food security measures? Our results show landholding to be a strong predictor of household food and nutrition security.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The Government of Vietnam has identified the conversion of forests to plantations of industrial crops such as rubber as one of the five drivers of deforestation and degradation in the country. Presently, Vietnam is actively participating in various international initiatives such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade (FLEGT) programmes. The implementation of these commitments requires Vietnam to establish and effectively operate mechanisms that address drivers of deforestation and degradation, including the drivers of natural forest conversion for rubber plantation. This report contributes essential information regarding the effects of rubber plantation expansion on the implementation of REDD+ and FLEGT initiatives in the future. The report has utilized various sources of primary and secondary data. Secondary data includes data on forest and forestland resources from the Vietnam Administration of Forestry (VNFOREST) and the General Department of Land Administration (GDLA) as well as technical reports from consulting organizations operating in areas of rubber production, processing, and export. The report also references articles from relevant press publications. Additionally, the authors have collected and analyzed Government policies related to development of rubber plantations in various provinces.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">For centuries, farmers in the mountainous region of mainland Southeast Asia have practiced shifting cultivation, with plots of land cultivated temporarily and then allowed to revert to secondary forest for a fallow period. Today, more than one million hectares have been converted to rubber plantation. By 2050, the area under rubber trees in the montane regions of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and China's Yunnan Province is predicted to increase fourfold. Preliminary research suggests this massive land-use change could lead to drier conditions at the local level plus surface erosion, loss of soil quality, sedimentation and disruption of streams, and risk of landslides. And it appears that when primary or secondary forests are converted to rubber, carbon emissions are likely to increase. Despite environmental concerns, both local farmers and outside entrepreneurs are likely to continue expanding rubber plantations because of high economic returns. Production systems that provide the best balance between economic return and environmental sustainability are needed to improve the long-term outlook for the region.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article traces the revenue category and legal concept of the Waste Land in Burma/Myanmar from its original application by the British colonial apparatus in the nineteenth century, to its later use in tandem with Burma Army counterinsurgent tactics starting in the 1960s, and finally to the 2012 land laws and current issues in international investment. This adaptation of colonial ideas about territorialization in the context of an ongoing civil war offers a new angle for under- standing the relationship between military tactics and the political economy of conflict and counterinsurgent strategies which crucially depended on giving local militias—both government and nongovernment—high degrees of autonomy. The recent government changes, including the more civilian representation in parliament and its shift to engage with Western economies, raise questions regarding the future of the military, as well as local autonomy and the rural peasantry’s access to land. As increasing numbers of international investors are poised to enter the Myanmar market, this article will revisit notions of land use and appropriation, and finally the role of the army and its changing relationship with Waste Lands.</style>

The scramble for the Waste Lands: Tracking colonial legacies, counterinsurgency and international investment through the lens of land laws in Burma/Myanmar. Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 35(September 2012), 295–311.; Overall-rel: The article explores the colonial origins of the legal category of “wasteland” and its continuing resonance in present day Myanmar. Making use of extensive historical and anthropological research, the author traces changes in land laws that have occurred alongside Burma’s turbulent political transformations. In doing so, the author draws a link between the state’s strategic classification of land as “wasted”, “unproductive” or “un(der)utilised”, and the appropriation of that land from those with weak or unclear tenure rights. The category of “wasteland” was first derived to covert more land into productive, revenue-generating land for the British colonial tax administration. The concept was then selectively adapted by military actors who used it as part of counterinsurgency tactics against ethnic movements to reclaim “derelict” land outside state control. The current push to commercialise agriculture by opening up the country to foreign investment is posited as the latest iteration of the use of the “wasteland” classification to appropriate land. The notion of “wasted”, “unproductive” lands of little ecological or economic significance is fundamental to the ethos of granting land concessions, making it “available” for productive investment in the eyes of the State.; Research-bas: The article is based on extensive historical research drawing on literature documenting legislative developments and policy transformations within Myanmar.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: The article underscores the central role that classifications of lands as “wasted” or “underutilised” play in legitimising dispossession and eviction of farmers and ethnic minorities in order to effect state control over territory and derive profits. The article highlights the importance of considering dispossession and land grabbing in the context of conflict and post-conflict political economic landscapes. Before Myanmar opened up politically, the Tatmadaw (central armed forces) would extract land and other contributions from villagers by theft and rent seeking to sustain its troops whilst they continued to battle ethnic insurgent forces in the country’s borderlands. With foreign direct investment presenting unprecedented opportunities for profit, the State has turned its attention to large scale, capital intensive, resource extraction and agriculture projects, which have resulted in widespread dispossession of rural communities. The customary lands of ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable to seizure by the State for reallocation to private concessions under the pretext of acquiring ‘vacant’ ‘wasteland’.; Distribution-rel: Designating land as ‘vacant’ or ‘wasteland’ serves to legitimise the redistribution of land according to state priorities and agendas. That includes state appropriation of land held under customary arrangements that is important to sustain local livelihoods. Because this land has been framed as having unrealised potential it is then easily reallocated to companies which often have connections to senior politicians and/or the military.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Ethnic minorities in peripheral conflict zones in Myanmar have historically been viewed as a threat to state authority. The project of bringing contested territories under state control through dispossession has been geared at bringing ethnic movements to heel, rather than as a means to elevate them from conditions of poverty. The historical trajectory of land laws in Myanmar has left ethnic rural populations, particularly those in conflict zones, suspicious of laws passed under the current reform process that claim to be promoting national development and peace by courting foreign investors. As the coveting of new alliances between state actors and private companies evolves there is significant potential for disputes to reignite conflict.; Policy-law-rel: Reconstructing national policy and law to legitimise new forms of control over land which favour state and economic actors has a long history, originating in colonial strategies of dispossession. The article demonstrates remarkable continuity in the legal classification of “wasteland” from colonial era laws through to 2012 land laws giving the State the right to allocate “fallow” or “vacant” land to private investors. In the context of Myanmar’s historical and continuing state of conflict in contested ethnic areas, land laws have been harnessed to military practices of exploitation and dispossession, undermining the rights and autonomy of indigenous groups. This has left the ethnic rural populations, particularly those in conflict zones, suspicious of laws and policies under the current reform process that claims to be essential to the project of ‘national development’ and peace. This has shaped the response of civil society towards laws and policies designed to attracted foreign investors in agriculture and land based developments.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This briefing note presents the findings of seven case studies conducted from May to June 2014. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal and Thailand and looked into the livelihood and food security among indigenous shifting cultivation communities in South and Southeast Asia. The briefing note provides a summary of the main findings of the case studies and the common recommendations from a multi-stakeholders consultation held August 28-29 in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Participants at the multi-stakeholder consultation included government agencies, UN agencies, regional NGOs, Indigenous Peoples’ organisations, community leaders, and local governments. Shifting cultivation and food security Across South and Southeast Asia a large number of people depend for their livelihood and food security fully or partly on shifting cultivation. The majority of the people practicing shifting cultivation in South and Southeast Asia belong to ethnic groups that are referred to as ethnic minorities, tribal people, hill tribes, aboriginal people or, as they increasingly call themselves, Indigenous Peoples. Shifting cultivation is probably one of the most misunderstood and thus controversial forms of land use. Over the past decades, arguments brought forward against this form of land use – that it is an economically inefficient and ecologically harmful practice – have been proven inaccurate or outright wrong. Yet, shifting cultivators are still widely discriminated and neglected and in most countries their land and resource rights are not recognized and protected. The studies take stock of the changes in livelihood and food security among indigenous shifting cultivation communities in South and Southeast Asia against the backdrop of the rapid socio-economic transformations currently engulfing the region.</style>

Shifting Cultivation, Livelihood and Food Security: New and Old Challenges for Indigenous Peoples in Asia. Chiang Mai.; Overall-rel: This summary report examines negative stigmas attached to shifting cultivation (also called swidden farming, rotational farming, or slash-and-burn agriculture) as a subsistence and livelihood strategy of mainly ethnic minority populations across South and Southeast Asia. This report contributes to the literature that critically examines the arguments against shifting cultivation. In particular, it explores how residual negative stigmas around shifting cultivation are being mobilised to subordinate ethnic minorities into a private ownership system. The report also highlights the ways in which the privatisation of land rights has disrupted communal and collective cultivation systems, and worked to undermine women’s positions.; Research-bas: This summary report offers preliminary findings and recommendations of a project on Regional Support to Indigenous Peoples for Livelihood and Food Security, undertaken by the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP) and FAO. This project includes a brief summary of findings from seven case studies carried out in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal.; Conversion-FoodSecurity-rel: As various land and forest allocation programs have engaged in land use planning and zoning, fallow areas have been restricted and given over to concessionaires, creating a significant process of impoverishment among mostly ethnic minority upland cultivators.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Those practicing swidden agriculture are mainly ethnic minorities in upland areas. Swidden farmers have been dispossessed of their land through the mobilisation of two key discourses. The first is a neoliberal economic rationale, which champions economic growth through modernisation of agriculture and the “efficient” use of “unproductive” land. The second is drawn from arguments on environmental conservation that posit swidden cultivators as destroyers of forests. State promotion of large-scale industrial agriculture has been a powerful force behind the reallocation of land previously used for shifting cultivation to private companies for agribusiness. Because shifting cultivation is premised on a fallow cycle, seemingly “un(der)utilised” land has been ripe for grabbing, particularly as shifting cultivators are often unwilling to declare it as agricultural land for tax purposes.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Efforts to control shifting cultivation are intertwined with a modernist project of creating sedentary and legible citizens that contribute to the state’s treasury. It is also a racialized discourse that posits ethnic minorities and their agricultural practices as backward and in need of modernization. With increased population and land pressure, shifting cultivation presents an ongoing tension between the state and its disparate ethnic minorities. The undermining of shifting cultivation systems have also disrupted the gendered nature of relations to cultivation and connection to land, further marginalising women’s positions, forcing them out of local contexts and into farm labour jobs where they earn significantly less than their male counterparts. As privatisation of land increases, women frequently find themselves pushed into subordinate forms of work, and forced into isolated household structures where domestic violence is increasingly prevalent, and socially hidden.; MigrationLabour-rel: The pressure to stop shifting cultivation has forced households to diversify their livelihoods, which frequently means relocating to urban centres or working as labourers on commercial farms. While stigmatising and, in some cases, criminalizing slash and burn farming has played a role, many young people in ethnic communities are migrating to urban centres to study and be part of the consumer economy and the life that urban centres offer. Migration towards urban centres has a complex tangle of drivers. When it does occur, it may not necessarily be permanent, as many of those living away from their rural communities still consider those communities to be home, and frequently remit money to their families.;</style>

When it does occur, it may not necessarily be permanent, as many of those living away from their rural communities still consider those communities to be home, and frequently remit money to their families.;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Although corruption is a core issue in discourses on Southeast Asian states and the region’s illegal timber trade, its specific meanings, characteristics, and role are poorly understood. Our ethnographic study of corruption and timber trade in the lower Mekong uncovers the relationships, dealings, and networks that enable illegal timber flows. We follow the disputed case of a shipment of high-value timber that originated in Laos and was seized by Vietnamese seaport customs officials in 2011. By examining the actors involved and their efforts to obtain the release of the timber, we reveal the complex and networked nature of relationships from local to national levels that enable illicit rosewood trade from Laos to Vietnam and onward from Vietnamese ports. At the same time, interactions between timber traders and state officials highlight the recursive relationship between ‘private’ and ‘state’ actors, and the scope for mobility between these categories. Our analysis challenges the current international and national emphasis on law enforcement as a means to tackle illegal logging. Instead, policy would be better founded on a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the socio-political relationships that characterise and perpetuate corruption across these multiple scales.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper examines the main drivers of resource conflict in Myanmar. The author first looks at the major resource-related projects that could crate conflict in the country, namely the Myitsone hydroelectric dam project, the Letpadaung copper mine and the Shwe oil and gas project. He then explores some of the other areas connected to resource conflict. These include increased foreign direct investment in the country; institutional corruption and revenue misappropriation; imbalances in resource revenue distribution and benefit sharing; delays in decentralization and subnational governance reform; the deterioration of certain ethnic state ceasefire agreements; and land confiscation and environmental degradation.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The purpose of the report is to provide documentary evidence of land disputes recorded throughout 2013. This evidence was gathered from articles on land disputes from local printed media, meetings with Land and Housing Right Network (LAHRiN)2 members, and through on site data collection. This report aims to raise awareness and understanding of the current situation regarding land disputes, and act as a resource for other stakeholders working on land issues, including the government and government offi cials, donors, LAHRiN members, Cambodian and international civil society and academic researchers, amongst others. The report will also provide documentation that NGO Forum and other groups may use to advocate for improved land tenure security for poor and vulnerable people in Cambodia. In addition, it is hoped that the contents of this report will be useful to government stakeholders that are working to fi nd solutions to Cambodia’s current land situation. Whilst NGO Forum is aware that the challenges are formidable, it is hoped that the result of this land dispute analysis will contribute to the implementation of policies and actions that will lead to the resolution of these land disputes.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Despite the many transformations taking place in Myanmar, its agricultural sector is lagging. A high proportion of rural households remain poor and food insecure as a result. This article examines the underlying causes of poor agricultural performance through a combination of literature and secondary data review combined with extensive field interviews with a broad range of key informants in the main agricultural zones of the country. We identify key structural changes that are needed to unleash smallholder-led agricultural transformation and broad-based rural economic growth.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">SUMMARY: The Vietnamese government has made some progress towards tackling illegal logging and the associated trade. It has negotiated a voluntary partnership agreement (VPA) with the EU, a process that has prompted a review of relevant legislation and improved the government’s engagement with civil society. In addition, it has signed agreements with Lao PDR and Cambodia in which it has committed to coordination on forest management and trade. However, there has been little progress in policy reform, and there is still no legislation regulating illegal timber imports. There is a high level of awareness of illegal logging and associated trade within the private sector: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) chain-of-custody (CoC) certification has increased rapidly, particularly in the furniture sector. But efforts are hampered by poor access to third-party verified raw material. Both trade data discrepancies and analysis of trade flows indicate that illegal trade remains a serious problem. The volume of imports of wood-based products at a high risk of illegality is estimated to have increased since 2000, while its share in the volume of total imports of wood-based products gradually declined until 2009 and then increased slightly: they are estimated to have comprised 18 per cent of the total by volume in 2013. In order to build on its response to illegal logging and related trade, the government should establish a legal responsibility for Vietnamese importers to ensure that their timber sources are legal. Furthermore, to increase domestic demand for legal products, it should establish a public procurement policy requiring the use of verified legal products. Within the framework of the VPA, broad and effective multi-stakeholder engagement will be vital to ensure that a robust timber legality assurance system is developed. In addition, proactive partnerships should be forged with high-risk supply countries to establish legality criteria and indicators that reflect the full scope of the relevant legislation in those countries.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Change is taking place in Myanmar. Since this ethnically and geographically diverse country elected its first civilian government in 2010, a series of rapid and dramatic reforms have taken place to allow freedom of expression, an opening of the economy and the consolidation of peace. The government has also taken the first tentative steps toward decentralization. In October 2013, Mercy Corps conducted a combined economic, governance and conflict assessment that focused on Myanmar’s southern Shan State as a microcosm of the issues present throughout the country. The assessment findings,detailed in &quot;Visibility vs. Vulnerability&quot; (download below), revealed that the opening of Myanmar has brought with it new complexities that require an integrated analysis of how economic and political vulnerabilities are tied to instability -- and dangers lie with the unexpected problems that will arise as a result of the transition process. Mercy Corps' report lays out several policy and program recommendations for increasing opportunities amid Myanmar's unprecedented change.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over 72% of land leases involve foreign investors, primarily Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai companies. Most products from these operations are exported as raw material to the investor countries, leaving little to no room for added value domestically to benefit the Laotian economy.8 Rubber is the larg- est single industry within land investment, making up 34% of all land conces- sions.9 The two largest rubber investors are Vietnamese corporations, Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL) and Vietnam Rubber Group (VRG). The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, has funded both companies.10 In February 2014, ethnic minority families filed a complaint accusing the IFC of breaking its own safeguard policies by investing in HAGL. The families called for the company to return land taken from them.1</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACT ORIGIN UNKNOWN: This report provides a recent update on land policies in the ethnic regions of Burma following the 2010 national elections and the beginning of the ceasefire with the Karen National Union in 2012. The authors argue that, while military conflict and associated abuses have declined, the Burmese government’s commitment to foreign investment and export-led economic growth is making traditional land tenure even less secure than before. The authors point out the importance of confronting the myths supporting land expropriation for industrial enterprises, and they also provide a rationale for supporting subsistence agriculture and indigenous land rights. Finally, while some scholars may advocate for the development of a private property land titling process to safeguard Karen people’s land rights, the authors of this report suggest that such action could make land tenure even less secure by reinforcing the idea that land rights are contingent on a piece of paper. Rather, the authors advocate for recognition of communal land rights under Karen customary law.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This report 'Aggregated outcomes of the community consultation supporting the improvement of the draft amended Land Law' presents the main findings from the community consultation process and recommendations of amendments of the draft Land Law. It aims to share the needs of the people, especially disadvantaged groups such as small scale farmers, marginalized poor and ethnic minority women and men. This report is based on the consultation with more than 1,300 people from the aforementioned groups and nearly 300 local government officers in 22 communes of 11 districts of 4 provinces (Hòa Bình, Yên Bái, Quảng Bình and Long An). The community consultation explored the status of land management and land-use, its impacts on disadvantaged groups, weaknesses and shortages in the enforcement of land policies and procedures and the 2003 Land Law. It puts forth concrete recommendations for the draft amended Land Law. The contents of the consultation included the most pervasive issues facing the community, including: land-use master planning and planning; the use of agricultural land; land allocation for ethnic minority people and forest farmland; land pricing; land acquisition, compensation, support and rehabilitation; and the participation of the community in land decision-making and oversight of the enforcement of land laws. Transparency of land management and land-use is a common issue in each of these areas.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over the past decade, and especially since 2008, the Burmese military government has been cooperating with its favoured large-scale Burmese companies to reshape landscapes, populations and livelihoods through the establishment of large-scale industrial agricultural concessions in Myanmar. This book uncovers several important trends in the emerging agribusiness sector in Myanmar and the models of agricultural development and investment that vary in different areas of the country. It also hopes to provide necessary analysis of the emerging agribusiness sector to stimulate dialogues among stakeholders about how smalholder farmers can benefit more from the changing land development.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The series of studies of which this is the overview are a contribution to the third year of this process. The aim of the studies has been to pull together in a simple form, updated information about large-scale land acquisitions in the region, with the aim of identifying trends, common threats, divergences and possible solutions. As well as summarising trends in investment, trade, crop development and land tenure arrangements, the studies focus on the land and forest tenure and human rights challenges. As shown on the map, seven national updates have been compiled based on the available literature for Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Timor- Leste and the Philippines, each following a similar format. The studies seek to summarise what laws and policies already exist in national human rights frameworks that could ensure respect for rights in large-scale land development and, on the basis of this analysis, recommend possible solutions to the problems identified. In this overview we bring out some of the key findings from these updates.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Farmer indebtedness is a serious problem in Myanmar and the number of landless farm households is increasing. Working capital finance for farmers is exceedingly expensive except for the rather small amounts provided by the MADB and bad harvests can mean that farmers need to sell their land to satisfy loan repayments, becoming casual laborers instead. There is a serious lack of financing for equipment. There are also very few storage facilities in villages that would allow farmers to store paddy and sell it later, hopefully at a higher price than right after harvest, nor are there lenders that would provide credit using the stored harvest as collateral. In order to solve the shortcomings of Myanmar’s rural finance system a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach is suggested. The following recommendations aim to address both the lack of financing for agricultural growth and the high level of indebtedness in rural areas. While most activities will require a long-term approach there are some short-term benefits to be had as well. Table five indicates which agencies would have a comparative advantage in taking on sponsorship of individual activities. A. Long Game – more than three years: 1) Explore the possibility to require commercial banks to dedicate a percentage of their loan portfolio to agricultural loans. This could already have short-term results; 2) Explore the possibility to restructure or reform MADB to become a commercially managed and sustainable bank. Some short-term results are possible as well; 3) Support the start-up and development of savings-based community financial institutions in remoter rural areas to address over-indebtedness; and 4) Support the government in developing an enabling framework for the financial sector. B. Short Game – benefits to be expected within 2-3 years: 1) Allow commercial banks to undertake agricultural lending and assist them in developing respective capabilities, if necessary; 2) Enable MFIs to extend their services further into rural areas and to develop agriculture finance products, including inventory credit; 3) Promote the set-up of leasing companies or leasing subsidiaries of existing financial institutions; and 4) Explore the potential for setting up providers of non-financial services to farmers. C. Recommendations regarding technology-driven innovations: 1) M-banking: Undertake preparatory work in setting up the enabling regulatory and licensing framework for m-banking. Determine and establish the possible partnership arrangements so that m-banking can be implemented fairly quickly once the technological and cost obstacles are overcome; and 2) International Remittances: Support the ongoing effort to enable efficient and cost- effective inward international remittances. They represent an interesting business proposal for Myanmar banks, given that an estimated 7 million Myanmar citizens live outside the country. No further information is available as to the level and distribution of remittances within the whole country or individual States.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">While there is ample evidence of state and corporate complicity in the serious and systematic human rights violations that have surrounded the development of industrial sugarcane plantations in Cambo- dia, nobody has been held accountable and those affected have been denied access to an effective remedy at the local and national levels. Unable to obtain redress through Cambodian institutions, affected communities have turned to Europe in search of accountability. However, they have found that there is no effective, independent accountability mechanism at the European Commission or anywhere within the EU structure that is available to people affected by EU policies or the activities of European companies outside of Europe’s borders. In the absence of such a mechanism, the EU’s le- gal and policy commitments to human rights abroad ring hollow to the people they are meant to serve. While the European Commission has recently committed to embed impact assessments and evalu- ations in trade policy-making and address all significant impacts, it has apparently not extended this commitment to the EBA initiative. This report underscores the urgent need for assessment and reform of the EBA scheme. If human rights safeguards are not integrated into the trade scheme, its poverty reduction goals will continue to be undermined and the EU will remain in violation of its international human rights obligations.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Of the many challenging issues that will require resolution within the peace processes currently underway between the government of Myanmar and various ethnic groups in the country, few will be as complex, sensitive and yet vital than the issues comprising housing, land and property (HLP) rights. Viewed in terms of the rights of the sizable internally displaced person (IDP) and refugee populations who will be affected by the eventual peace agreements, and within the broader political reform process, HLP rights will need to form a key part of all of the ongoing moves to secure a sustainable peace, and be a key ingredient within all activities dedicated to ending displacement in Myanmar today. The Government Myanmar (including the military) and its various ethnic negotiating partners – just as with all countries that have undergone deep political transition in recent decades, including those emerging from lengthy conflicts – need to fully appreciate and comprehend the nature and scale of the HLP issues that have emerged in past decades, how these have affected and continue to affect the rights and perspectives of justice of those concerned, and the measures that will be required to remedy HLP concerns in a fair and equitable manner that strengthens the foundations for permanent peace. Resolving forced displacement and the arbitrary acquisition and occupation of land, addressing the HLP and other human rights of returning refugees and IDPs in areas of return, ensuring livelihood and other economic opportunities and a range of other measures will be required if return is be sustainable and imbued with a sense of justice. There is an acute awareness among all of those involved in the ongoing peace processes of the centrality of HLP issues within the context of sustainable peace, however, all too little progress has thus far been made to address these issues in any detail, nor have practical plans commenced to resolve ongoing displacement of either refugees or IDPs. Indeed, the negotiating positions of both sides on key HLP issues differ sharply and will need to be bridged; many difficult decisions remain to be made. At this stage of the various negotiations, offering final recommendations to the many negotiating parties on the intricacies of what will be required to secure HLP rights may be somewhat premature. As such, this report concludes with a series of preliminary recommendations that are designed to bridge any HLP gaps that may be in place between the parties and to facilitate ways and means of addressing these issues within peace agreements that best serve the interests of all involved.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The recent proliferation of transnational land deals has put the long-fraught relationship between international cooperation, national development and local dispossession back in the political spotlight. This article argues that transnational land access cannot be resolved as a political question without a better understanding of the material, legal and administrative geographies that accompany and enable it. Using evidence from Laos, the paper illustrates two tools for ‘resolving’ the global land grab geographically: first, a biographical or trajectory-based approach that connects specific land grabs to larger development landscapes (e.g. of urban infrastructuring); and second, genealogies of property formalization that interrogate and deconstruct the legal geographies of land access, both on and off the map. The paper concludes by suggesting that these tools have purchase elsewhere as well.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In light of the increasingly volatile nature of the land conflict in Cambodia, this Report aims to describe the sources, forms and impact of the conflict throughout the country. The Report offers an overview of the land conflict throughout the country and provides recommendations to the RGC. Chapter 1 (Introduction) provides a brief overview of the status of land rights and the different ownership system throughout Cambodia’s history and of the land situation in today’s Cambodia, before discussing the scope, methodology and purpose of this Report. Chapter 2 (The Theory: a Protective Legal Framework) provides an overview of the international and domestic rights and obligations related to land and housing rights applicable in Cambodia. Chapter 3 (The Practice: Lawlessness) discusses how the poor implementation of the laws described in Chapter 2 facilitates insecurity of tenure, opaque deregulated development and violent forced evictions. It also looks at the lack of dispute resolution mechanisms and remedies in cases of land disputes and right’s violations. Chapter 4 (The Consequences: Impact Assessment of the Land Conflict) emphasizes the devastating socio-economic impact of forced evictions on the population, the particular impact of the land conflict with regards to women, children, and indigenous people and its disastrous impact on the environment. Chapter 5 (Conclusions and Recommendations) concludes that the land conflict in Cambodia is violent, widespread and with no end in sight and further provides recommendations to the RGC in order to bring about positive changes.</style>

The adoption of laws guaranteeing equal protection of women and non-discrimination should not be mistaken for the actual delivery of equal rights and non-discriminatory practices, and therefore satisfaction with the spirit and intent of the Convention. Since its last report, the RGC has achieved little measureable progress; stagnation being the norm, with some areas seeing regression. Article</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This Report analyses Cambodia’s development dynamism over the last two decades and identifies emerging development priorities for the next two. It examines Cambodia’s past performance, emerging priorities and future challenges in economic, social, environmental and political spheres. One of the distinguishing features of this Report is that it examines Cambodia’s past performance and emerging development priorities within a multi-country comparative perspective. The guiding principle was to select a few small to medium-size Asian economies that had broadly similar income levels to Cambodia during the five consecutive decades from the 1950s through to the 1990s. Six such “comparator” countries were selected – Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar from Southeast Asia, and Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan from South Asia. Unlike the comparator countries, Indonesia and Thailand share few commonalities with Cambodia, especially in terms of income levels. From a futuristic perspective, however, Cambodia has the potential to achieve an income level closer to that enjoyed by these countries today, say, in two decades time. Indonesia and Thailand, then, serve as “benchmark” countries in identifying the emerging priorities and a development vision for Cambodia over the coming years.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The Kuy are one of the largest Indigenous groups in Cambodia. Though they are extremely similar to the Khmer in terms of physical appearance and material culture, a significant distinction between the two groups continues to be maintained. At the same time, assimilation into the Khmer identity has been a dominant trend among the Kuy for a considerable time and appears to be related to the relatively lower status of the Kuy identity.However, over the past decade or more, some people have begun to reassert a Kuy identity, driven by awareness of benefits of identifying as Kuy and a lessening of the stigmatisation of the Kuy identity. Following the introduction in Cambodia of the concept of Indigenous Peoples, ‘Indigenous’ has become an ethnic identity that more and more Kuy are assuming and within which they are becoming prominent. It is associated with a broader Indigenous community inside and outside of Cambodia which is becoming increasingly respected. The Indigenous identity has been able to inspire pride and confidence in a way that the Kuy identity has not and has played an important role in letting people of Kuy ancestry ‘become Kuy’.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE PREFACE: The origin of this report dates back to 2002, when the first Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) was carried out. The results of the VARHS02 inspired the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and the Centre for Agricultural Policy Consulting of the Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development (CAP-IPSARD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the Institute of Labour Science and Social Affairs (ILSSA) of the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA), and the Development Economics Research Group (DERG) of the University of Copenhagen, together with Danida, to plan and carry out another survey in 2006 and subsequently in 2008 and in 2010. The survey on which the present report is based builds on these previous four rounds. The fieldwork behind this report, referred to the VARHS12, consisted of interviews of more than 3,700 households in the months of June and July of 2012. It was carried out in the rural areas of 12 provinces in Vietnam: (i) four (ex-Ha Tay, Nghe An, Khanh Hoa and Lam Dong) supported by Danida under the Business Sector Programme Support (BSPS); (ii) five (Dak Lak, Dak, Nong, Lao Cai, Dien Bien and Lai Chau) supported under the Agriculture and Rural Development Sector Programme Support (ARDSPS); and (iii) three (Phu Tho, Quang Nam and Long An), which were all initially surveyed in 2002 and are now covered by the BSPS. The 2012 sample has been expanded by more than 500 households in order to ensure that the sample is representative of the rural population within the sampled provinces. This addition makes the VARHS an even stronger tool for gaining detailed and policy relevant information about the economy and society of rural Vietnam.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Under Vietnam’s State land ownership regime, the Government holds supreme authority over compulsory land acquisition. The results show that many improvements in land acquisition policies have been made, but poor implementation measures largely cannot prevent or even mitigate the adverse impacts on displaced persons. In particular, ineffective compensation measures and a lack of production land and livelihood alternatives accelerate the resistance of communities displaced as a result of hydropower development. The close alliance between the local government and the investor, which is considered as an “interest group”, is the main factor that leads to the ignorance of benefits of displaced people within the compulsory land acquisition process.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper discusses Cambodia’s legal framework relating to Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) and looks at the implementation gaps. It argues that despite Cambodian’s legal framework governing land and ELCs being well-developed, its social benefits, such as protecting the rights of the poor and vulnerable and contributing to transparency and accountability, are almost non-existent. Recent evidence suggests that the Government’s handling of natural resources is a far cry from its official land policy which is “to administer, manage, use and distribute land in an equitable, transparent, efficient, and sustainable manner”. This paper argues that this is due to (1) a large gap between the country’s legal framework and the implementation of the country’s land concession policies and (2) a complete disregard of the country’s customary land rights. It will explain that the current political environment benefits the exploitation of the country´s natural resources. Widespread corruption and nepotism encourages growing inequality in land ownership and a significant power imbalance between small groups of powerful, politically and economically well-connected elites and poor and vulnerable people in Cambodia. This is exacerbated by the lack of implementation of appropriate regulations. This elite exercises control over the judiciary and has created a climate of impunity, thus hindering the overall implementation of the legal framework and serving their own interests. The paper will further look into recent Government actions such as the moratorium on ELCs and a new land titling initiative and assess whether these actions have the potential to reverse or perpetuate the current inequality in land holdings.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: Burma has entered a pivotal stage in its political and economic development. The advent of a new quasi- civilian government has raised the prospect of fundamental reforms. This has sparked great investment interest among governments and the private sector in the region and beyond, to extract the country’s nat- ural-resource wealth, and to develop large-scale infrastructure projects to establish strategic ‘corridors’ to connect Burma to the wider economic region. The country is touted as Asia’s “final frontier” for resources and investment and as Asia’s next “economic tiger”. These large-scale investment projects focus on the borderlands, where most of the natural resources in Burma are found. These areas are home to poor and often marginalised ethnic minority groups, and have been at the centre of more than 60 years of civil war in Burma – the longest running in the world. These war- torn borderlands are now in the international spotlight as regions of great potential but continuing poverty and grave humanitarian concern. Such investment is not conflict-neutral and has in some cases fuelled local grievances and stimulated ethnic conflict. Economic grievances among ethnic groups – often tied to resources being extracted from the bor- derlands to sustain the government and business elites – have played a central part in fuelling the civil war. While regional investment could potentially foster economic growth and improve people’s livelihoods, the country has yet to develop the institutional and governance capacity to manage the expected windfall. Burma is emerging from decades under military rule, and the foreign-funded mega projects have not, to date, ben- efited local communities. Land-grabbing has increased, and the recent economic laws and new urban wealth have not brought about tangible improvements for the poor. If local communities are to benefit from the reforms, there need to be new types of investment and pro- cesses of implementation. The government should direct investment towards people-centred development that benefits household economies. There is a need to resolve conflict through dialogue and reconciliation. These are the hallmarks of a robust and healthy democracy. In their absence, the development of Asia’s final frontier will only deepen disparity between the region’s most neglected peoples and the new military, busi- ness and political elites whose wealth is rapidly increasing. This publication is part of a joint TNI-BCN project that aims to stimulate strategic thinking on addressing ethnic conflict in Burma and to give a voice to ethnic nationality groups who have, until now, been ignored and isolated in the international debate on the country. In order to respond to the challenges of political change, TNI and BCN believe it is crucial to formulate practical and concrete policy options and define concrete benchmarks on progress that national and international actors can support. The project aims to achieve greater support for a Burma policy that is pragmatic, engaged and grounded in reality.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">INTRODUCTION: Over the years HURFOM has produced a number of accounts highlighting the hardships faced by Mon farmers who became victims of land confiscation or unjust land acquisition.1 In this report HURFOM follows-up on previously documented abuses and concentrates on an emerging new trend: farmers’ active and collective pursuits for rights to their land. Disputed Territory aims to elaborate on the activities of and express solidarity with farmers who are resolutely, and in some cases for the first time, seeking justice regarding their land. To exhibit current challenges and bring into focus some of the key obstacles in the Mon context, this report uses case studies of appeals over past military land confiscations in Ye Township and on-going transgressions by various investors in Kyaikmayaw Township. Where barriers to justice exist, HURFOM recommends effective and immediate solutions. HURFOM contends that farmers’ newly voiced demands present an important opportunity for President Thein Sein’s government. Inherent in an environment of growing activism is the chance to meet appeals with justice, thereby demonstrating to domestic and international critics that the administration is committed to a clear break with the abuses of past military regimes. Violations of farmers’ rights need to be publicly condemned and owners of wrongfully seized land must have property restored or be given fair compensation. There is an urgent need for the establishment of a credible legal framework to prevent dispossession and violated rights from continuing to be hallmarks of agrarian life under this government’s nominally civilian rule. The argument presented herein is simple. Since 2011 farmers have been actively pursuing their rights to land, yet to date little progress has been made. Few past victims of unjust land acquisition have had land returned, misconduct by investors in land acquisition continues, and secure land rights remain virtually absent from Burmese law. Given the focus on farmers’ struggle for their rights, this report pays considerable attention to the legal framework in which past and on-going land disputes have taken place. Inadequate legislation and public lack of awareness of existing legal rights are highlighted as key reasons why Mon farmers do not possess rights to their land in 2013. In a nation emerging from conflict and actively pursuing economic development, farmers are in desperate need of robust, legally enshrined protection of their land rights. With government land surveys characterised by a lack of transparency and enduring bias, the precise number of acres of land unjustly acquired from Mon farmers over the years remains nearly impossible for an organisation of HURFOM’s capacity to confirm. However, information gathered for this report suggests that it stretches to tens of thousands of acres. HURFOM calls on all persons in positions of authority to elevate the voices and champion the rights of farmers who for generations have crafted Burma’s unique and prolific landscape.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: In this chapter, I explore how courts in Vietnam navigate and reconcile different regulatory approaches to housing and land disputes in Hanoi. To what extent and in what circumstances do courts draw on guidance from outside the juridical framework to resolve disputes? What constitutes fair and reasonable access to housing and land? Do courts ultimately have the power to put an end to quarrels and formulate lasting solutions to housing and land disputes? To address these questions, I examine at close range a series of housing and land disputes in Hanoi. The Vietnamese Constitution 1992 requires courts to resolve disputes according to the law. My findings suggest, on the contrary, that judges quickly exhaust the possibilities of statutory land rights and legal doctrines, and either push cases back to state officials or use &quot;reason and sentiment in applying the law&quot; (ly va tinh trong viec chap hanh phap luat), a type of situational justice, to to resolve cases. Outcomes are negotiated from a syncretic blend of statutory law, state policies, and community norms and practices. Contrary to de Soto's proposition I find that land titling has not brought legal order to housing and land disputes. Instead courts continue to rely more on administrative and self-regulatory norms and practices than statutory property rights to resolve housing and land disputes. To identify the norms and tacit assumptions underlying the different points along the regulatory continuum I draw on a series of interviews with retired state officials and a private land broker. Since most court judgements are not published in Vietnam, and even then only provide a sketchy account of events, I also relied on interviews with judges and lawyers to understand dispute resolution. Altogether I reviewed eighteen land and housing cases, and further twenty-three cassation appeal cases from 2005-6 that were published on a website hosted by the Supreme People's Court.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Ethnicminority farmers in the infamous Golden Triangle were first incorpo- rated into the nation states of China, Laos and Thailand, and later into the economic region called the Golden Economic Quadrangle. This article traces policies in each country for minorities, development and the environment, followed by an analysis of agrarian transitions under economic regional- ization. Using the framework of powers of exclusion and racialization, our findings show the changes for ethnic minorities who, with the exception of those in the lowlands, face environmental enclosures that dispossess them from lands on which livelihoods are based. Ideological legacies from the Golden Triangle, including ‘backward’ minorities, the fight against drugs, and threats to national security, continue to inform policies and development projects. Whilesomefarmers have become entrepreneurs planting cash crops, most face increasing marginalization under deepening regional capitalism.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The rubber tree is native to the humid tropics and has traditionally been cropped in the equatorial zone between 108Nand 108S; in mainland Southeast Asia this includes portions of southern Thailand, southeastern Vietnam, and southern Myanmar. In the early 1950s, the Chinese government began to invest in growing rubber in environments perceived to be ecologically marginal and eventually established state rubber plantations in areas that lie as far north as 228 north latitude. China’s success in growing rubber in these ‘non-traditional’ environ- ments expanded the habitat in which rubber could be planted and pushed it further north. Today entrepreneurs from China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand are investing in rubber plantations in areas of Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, northwest Vietnam, northeast Thailand, and Yunnan, China. The impact of rubber on smallholders, however, is not yet clear. Experiences in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China and northeast Thailand clearly show that smallholder rubber production is a viable and effective proposition in moving households and communities out of poverty. By contrast in countries such as Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar many farmers are struggling to maintain their lands and forests in the face of growing pressures from investors and government institutions to impose concession arrangements.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) plays a leading role in the achievement of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1 – the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. The majority of the world’s poor live in rural areas and have labour and land as their only or main productive assets. Therefore, promoting secure access to and control and use of land as well as secure and productive employment and decent work for women and men in rural areas is vital to achieving MDG1. The State of Food and Agriculture 2010-11: Women in Agriculture, Closing the Gender Gap for Development (FAO 2011a, the SOFA), FAO’s flagship publication, provides solid evidence showing that gender inequalities in access to agricultural assets, inputs, services and rural employment opportunities are partially accountable for the underperformance of the agricultural sector in many developing countries. It also demonstrates that the gender gap imposes real costs on society in terms of lost agricultural output, food insecurity and poorer economic growth. Without sustainable improvements in gender equity in access to land, employment and income-generating opportunities, the achievement of global food security and poverty reduction targets will be seriously undermined. At the same time, the global food and financial crises over recent years have led development policy- makers and international organizations to re-prioritize the role of agriculture within both international and national policy agendas. The importance of investing in agriculture and rural development has been widely emphasized, and several international initiatives have focused on ensuring such investment is responsible, sustainable and beneficial to the majority of poor people in rural areas. Hard evidence on the implications of recent agricultural investments for the poverty status and food security of rural women and men is still limited, particularly from a perspective which looks at gender-differentiated implications and the potential consequences of these investments for rural development. The Gender Equity and Rural Employment (ESW) division of FAO, in consultation with the International Land Coalition (ILC), and the Trade and Markets (EST) and Climate, Energy and Tenure (NRC) divisions of FAO, has therefore developed a programme of work to contribute to filling this gap. The FAO work programme has a number of complementary components, including a series of case studies in countries where private foreign investments are already operational. The present report, on agricultural investments in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), is the second in this series of case studies. It is based primarily on a period of four weeks fieldwork in Laos in November 2011, in which interviews were held with over 68 key informants and with some 114 people (51 women and 63 men) who were consulted in 17 focus group discussions with local farmers and agricultural workers. The fieldwork was carried out in three of Lao PDR’s 17 provinces – Borikhamxai, Vientiane and Vientiane Capital – with the active support and facilitation of the FAO Country Office and the Government of Lao PDR. Six companies covering a wide range of business models and crops were selected. Among those, there is a tobacco producer. Given the existing conflict of interest between the tobacco industry and public health and recognizing FAO’s role, as part of the United Nations Ad Hoc Interagency Task Force on Tobacco Control, in promoting economically viable and sustainable alternatives for tobacco workers and growers, this report does not support nor endorse the tobacco value chain. This report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 provides a brief background to the issues globally and describes the methodology. Chapter 3 comprises the main body of the case study, drawing on information gathered in the key informant interviews and focus group discussions, as well as on relevant secondary materials. It situates the case in Laos and explores the policy context and key gender and governance issues around land-related agricultural investments. It also presents from the fieldwork some primary data on agricultural investments and examples of good practices from companies and for an enabling environment for smallholders. Chapter 4 then ends the report with overall conclusions and policy recommendations for land-related investments in agriculture in Laos.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article reviews recent research on contemporary transformations of global land governance. It shows how changes in global governance have facilitated and responded to radical revalorizations of land, together driving the intensified competition and struggles over land observed in many other contributions to this special issue. The rules in place to govern land use are shifting from ‘territorial’ toward ‘flow-centered’ arrangements, the latter referring to governance that targets particular flows of resources or goods, such as certification of agricultural or wood products. The intensifying competition over land coupled with shifts toward flow-centered governance has generated land uses involving new forms of social exclusion, inequity and ecological simplification.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Burma has been praised in recent years for the return to a civilian government and for the implementation of legislative reforms; international economic sanctions are being lifted and President Thein Sein became the first Burmese politician to enter the White House since 1966. However, this common picture does not reveal the depth and complexity of the current situation in Burma. Now is a crucial time. Despite taking superficial steps towards reform, encounters with local populations show that little substantial change in terms of extensive environmental degradation, human rights, and government transparency is ac- tually being witnessed on the ground. On the contrary, in the face of frequently discussed reform, issues such as civil war, ethnic cleansing, extensive human rights abuses, blatant disregard for rule of law, and other contentious topics continue to characterize life for significant proportions of the population. All the while, existing legislation continues to centralize government power, restrict basic human freedoms, and deter those inside from establishing adequate, equitable and legitimate social change. In this light, a sound understanding of Burma’s existing legal framework is vital to truly comprehend the state of affairs. As the country begins to open up for the first time in more than 60 years, foreign investors and energy consumers worldwide are beginning to look progressively towards Burma and its rich natural resources. Aimed at policy makers, investors, corporations, various governments, intergovernmental groups and other stakeholders, this briefer seeks to highlight the necessity of a sound domestic legal framework in Burma through a critical analysis of the current limitations and implications thereof. Burma’s Constitution and legislation must not solely represent a centralized government, but simultaneously protect the people and environment of Burma. Pending the essential policy changes recommended in this briefer, natural resource development, foreign direct investment and other relevant activities, particularly in the extractive industry, should be put to a halt. Any parties engaging in these activities choose to ignore serious environmental, social, and transparency related issues. They may, therefore, be accused of lacking the due diligence necessary to ensure good global governance in Burma.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Rural and livelihood studies, alongside development organisations, are stressing the importance of genderawareness in debates over food security, food crises and land tenure. Yet, within the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, these gender dynamics are frequently disregarded. In Vietnam, rice is intimately linked to the country’s food security. Over the last decade, rice export levels, production methods, and local and global market prices have remained constant preoccupations for governmental and development agencies. Steadfast official approval for agricultural technologies and intensification has seen the domestic growth and importation of hybrid varieties of rice and maize seeds. Yet, the impacts of these technologies on upland ethnicminority rice producers and consumers in Vietnam have been overlooked. For these women and men, such as Hmong and Yao farmers, food security is a daily concern for their near-subsistence livelihoods. While strongly encouragedto growthesenewseeds, insufficient researchhasexaminedthe social realities and experiences of these upland minority groups.Moreover, how such agrarian policies and practices are being implicated in reconfiguring gender roles, relations and identities through transformations to individual and household livelihoods has been ignored. In this article,wefocus onthe genderedconsequences of the government’shybrid rice programme for upland farmers. We reveal recent impacts on family relations, including rising intergenerational tensions acrossgenders, andshiftingresponsibilities and new negotiations between young spouses. These dynamics are further complicated by household economic status, as householdmembers access specific opportunities available to them to improve everyday food security.</style>

Gender, Place and Culture, 21(December), 1302–1320.; Overall-rel: The article explores the perception of ethnic minority groups towards national programs aimed at promoting food security in upland Vietnam. In particular, it examines the ways in which national food security programs catalyse shifts in the gendered dynamics of both inter and intra-household power relations that produce differential experiences between genders within these programs. The paper shows the tension between state claims about the need to address food security by promoting increased agricultural productivity, on the one hand, and the anxieties ethnic minorities experience about adopting programs which create dependencies on state subsidised seed, expensive fertilizers and pesticides, on the other. While increased yield may be the outcome under ideal environmental conditions, changing market prices for inputs and unreliable state controlled schedules for seed distribution can undermine profit, and further marginalise upland communities. At the same time, women’s roles within the household structure are being redefined as they seek to contribute financially to the increasing costs of inputs and labour by diversifying the household income in ways that can increase their independence. These changes in gender roles are being met with resistance from the older generation, who harbour resentment towards young women’s rejection of traditional family structures, and apply social pressure in order to influence their choices.; Research-bas: This article is based on 58 interviews conducted with Hmong and Yao villagers in northern upland Vietnam from 2009 to 2012. It also draws on the authors’ extensive ethnographic research experience in Vietnam since 1999.; AgriculturalModernisation-rel: State sponsored programs aimed at intensifying agricultural outputs are designed with one outcome in mind, and frequently ignore the unintended social reconfigurations they trigger. This is particularly salient within ethnic minority communities, who often have complex and culturally significant relationships with the crop varieties they cultivate, and the social relationships built around communal agricultural practices.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: State sponsored programs of agricultural intensification are aimed at increasing productivity at a national level. However, they often fail to consider the how these programs can disturb agricultural practices and threaten food security in ethnic communities by encouraging dependency on expensive hybrid seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and dissuading the use of local varieties that have been carefully selected for their ecological resilience, taste and other characteristics for generations. The article reveals how state agricultural programs can have both empowering and disempowering effects on ethnic minority women, in unexpected ways. On the one hand, the state’s introduction of the hybrid seeds program was exclusionary of women, since training was held in Vietnamese language, which Hmong and Yao women cannot generally speak. The program itself disregards women’s knowledge of and role in seed selection. On the other hand, the introduction of the program allowed women to become significant financial contributors within the household as women began to play a part in accessing capital for seed purchase. These changes enabled women access to greater freedoms as they looked to diversify their livelihood structures in the face of changing agricultural practices and increasing need to access capital for agriculture.; Policy-law-rel: Considering that various Vietnamese land laws and policies include specific reference to gender equality, it is significant that no mechanisms are in place to monitor the impact of specific agricultural intensification programs on gender relations. There is much room for further research in this area, as this article indicates that impacts are often unevenly distributed among women depending on their location, marital status, and position within extended family structures.;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The notion that Cambodia’s highland people may claim a distinct ‘Indigenous’ identity has emerged only recently in Cambodia. To date, advocacy for rights under the banner of indigeneity has produced few results for highlanders. Among the problems faced by advocates for Indigenous rights, problems of definition and translation represent an important challenge. Arguing that concepts like ‘Indigeneity’ are not simply adopted ex nihilo in new settings, but are rather incorporated into existing structures of meaning, this paper explores culturally produced understandings of who highlanders are, concentrating in particular on the way that the term ‘Indigenous’ has been translated into Khmer. The use of the Khmer word daeum, or ‘original’, to distinguish between Indigenous and other forms of ethnic belonging in the newly derived translation of ‘Indigenous Peoples’ points to historically sedimented beliefs about highlanders as living ancestors of modern Khmers.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This report is an independent assessment of human rights issues related to the German-Cambodian Land Rights Program (LRP), which began in March 2011. The assessment was neither tasked to evaluate the impact of German predecessor programs in the land sector nor to undertake a legal assessment of the LRP’s sphere of influence and thus does not do so. The assessment aims to gain insights which can be used for management decisions by the BMZ as well as for a possible next phase of the LRP (03/2013- 02/2016). The report is based on a desk review of available documentation and a two-week mission to Cambodia in June 2012. The key reference framework for the assessment are human rights – standards and principles - to which both the Cambodian as well as the German govern - ments have legally and politically committed them - selves through ratification of international human rights treaties and respective constitutional provisions.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In 2001 a new Land Law was adopted in Cambodia. It was significant because - for the first time - it recognised a new legal category of people, Indigenous Peoples or chuncheat daoem pheak tech in Khmer, and it also introduced the legal concept of communal land rights to Cambodia. Indigenous Peoples are not mentioned in the 1993 constitution of Cambodia or any legislation pre-dating the 2001 Land Law. However, Cambodia's 2002 Forestry Law also followed the trend by recognising Indigenous Peoples. These laws have been both symbolically and practically important, as they have provided government-mandated legitimacy to Indigenous identities and associated land and forest rights, including communal land rights, and have been ontologically significant in dividing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples on legal grounds. Over a decade after the 2001 Land Law was promulgated, this article considers some aspects of its effects. In particular, when compared with the potential for developing communal land rights in Laos, one has to wonder how advantageous it is to adopt Indigenous identities and the types of communal land rights and community forestry rights presently possible in Cambodia.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In June 2012, the Cambodian Government issued a policy directing the private titling of all plots throughout the country’s rural areas. In this study conducted in collaboration with seven NGOs throughout 79 indigenous villages in Ratanakiri Province, indigenous leaders reported negative impacts of the policy including loss of communal land, lack of transparency and information, and coercion to privatize land. If the policy continues to be carried out over indigenous areas in its current form, it will exacerbate internal and external divisions in communities and conflicts with companies, complicate the legal rights framework, and ultimately cause loss of land and livelihoods for the indigenous people of Cambodia.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Rabe, A. (2013). Issues and Impacts of Private Land Titling in Indigenous Communities: A Case Study in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia.; Overall-rel: This article examines how an individualised land titling program implemented under Prime Minister Hun Sen’s Order 01 (also known as Directive 01BB) served to undermine communal land titling efforts and weaken indigenous land rights in Ratanakiri Province, in north-eastern Cambodia. Implemented ahead of national elections, the land titling campaign was touted by the Government of Cambodia as a means of resolving land conflicts between villagers and economic land concessionaries, and a way to give land back to communities. However, by only issuing private land titles, Order 01 failed to protect communal lands and in fact made these lands more vulnerable to seizure by companies. The article highlights the incompatibility of the Order 01 private land titling campaign with existing legal framework recognising communal land tenure rights of indigenous people. The case studies reveal that villages at different stages of applying for communal land titles were frequently pressured or coerced by those implementing the program to accept private land titles by presenting these as the only option for keeping their lands from being handed over to companies or the state. Far from resolving indigenous peoples’ disputes with companies, the research shows a potential for further aggravation as those communities which accepted private titles are now at greater risk of losing their communal lands to companies. Moreover, Directive 01BB left some communities divided between those who chose to accept private titles, and those who did not. ; Research-bas: This report is the output of research conducted by seven NGOs in 79 villages in Ratanakiri Province, northeast Cambodia, over two months in 2013. Of the 79 villages investigated, 26 were affected by Order 01. Information was collected through interviews, group consultations and questionnaires. The research included villages representing seven different ethnic groups.; AccessToJustice-rel: The students who were charged with measuring land were not trained or equipped to handle or resolve complex land conflicts between companies and communities. In order to issue private titles, students often placed the responsibility for solving land disputes back onto communities who were locked in stalemates with companies who refused to acknowledge their position. Blocked from accessing support from NGOs as advisors, villagers were threatened and coerced into accepting private titles as the only option for resolving complicated disputes with companies.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Most villages targeted by the land titling campaign lived near economic land concessions and were consequently put under pressure to secure their customary land ownership as quickly as possible. However, the process for obtaining communal land titles in Cambodia is slow and cumbersome, with various communities waiting more than ten years for claims to be processed. The research found that many communities in Ratanakiri would rather have secured their communal lands, but since the communal land titling process was taking too long, the company would soon clear the rest of their land if they did not accept the private titles. The study also found that the issuing of private land titles divided communities into a patchwork of individualised plots which increased their vulnerability to land seizures from companies. Particularly in cases where households experience financial hardship, companies are able to pressure households to sell their land for below market prices. Indigenous communities are being forced to make difficult choices between individual and communal land title, yet neither option safeguards against dispossession by companies and other powerful actors.; Formalisation-titling-rel: The discourse championing formalisation of title as the silver bullet for resolving conflicts over land, and to ensure security of tenure, is problematic. Ethnic communities fighting for communal tenure rights have been effectively blocked by projects which coerce them into accepting private land titles. As a result of this pressure, village heads have reported divisions in their communities, loss of momentum towards their goals of achieving communal title, and increases in land dispossession. Rather than increasing their security of tenure, privatisation of land tenure has in some cases undermined it, as companies are able to apply pressure on individual holders more effectively than they are able to challenge a unified community.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: The extent to which methods of intimidation and coercion were utilised by the students who surveyed land as well as local authorities raises questions about why private land title is so highly prioritised by the state and why communal title was excluded from Order 01. Part of the answer to this question may be found in the derogatory manner in which students talked about communal land tenure, including comparing it to land arrangements under the Pol Pot regime. This emotionally potent comparison points to the historical shaping of anxieties within contemporary neoliberal projects of privatisation.; Policy-law-rel: Whilst the 2001 Cambodian Land Law acknowledges communal tenure rights, these laws were effectively undermined by Order 01. Private title was presented to ethnic communities as an ultimatum: accept it or risk losing your land completely. Confusion brought about as a result of constant changes to the Directive created a climate of uncertainty and fear, allowing those behind the titling campaign to manipulate villagers into participating without being fully informed about the implications of accepting private title for ongoing communal land rights claims. Lack of transparency and misinformation in the process of implementing the titling campaign is in contravention of formal commitments to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Based primarily on fieldwork with Kuy peoples in Rovieng District, Preah Vihear Province, this article examines contemporary Indigeneity in Cambodia as an emergent heterogeneous and polythetic identity vis-à-vis the changing nature of the state, and suggests that a more substantive political engagement with Indigenous identity and history offers a pluricultural reframing of the world heritage of Cambodia and a possible source of alternative land regimes that are more sustainable and equitable than the current dominant neoliberal model of land concessions. Although the 2001 Cambodian National Land Law holds critical significance for Indigenous Peoples in pursuit of communal land rights, it has largely failed to protect rights because of: 1. persistent discrimination against groups now claiming Indigenous identities, embedded in state procedures of Indigenous identity and land registration; and 2. the state's demonstrated embrace of land concession regimes as the preferred strategy of economic development. The Delcom mining concession of Kuy lands provides one example of the destructive impacts of this strategy. An examination of the evidence of Kuy peoples' history suggests that their classification as ethnic minorities is of recent origins, and that in the past they played more active roles in Cambodian state-building projects.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">INTRODUCTION: Large-scale land acquisitions are a reality in most regions worldwide. Vast areas of land are leased to foreign as well as national investors on a long term basis of 30-99 years. A growing number of reports, referring to this practice as ‘land grabbing’, show that these mostly very intransparent deals tend to go along with corruption, forced evictions and other human rights violations as well as enhanced com- petition over water. The challenges associated to the large scale land acquisitions are even height- ened in conflict-prone regions, where property of and access to land and water often are among the key dividing issues. Swiss organizations in development and peace promotion are facing various negative impacts of land acquisitions in their projects. Powerful econom- ic and political interests reshape patterns of water and land management in regions where land acqui- sitions take place. Local land users in different pro- ject areas are pressured or forced to give up the land they are cultivating and living on. The organiza- tions themselves and their local partner institutions face various threats when engaging in advocacy work on the issue. This roundtable on conflict sensitive water and land management assembled representatives of Swiss civil society and state agencies. They debated the implications of land acquisition on their work as well as their responses. The event featured the two country cases of Ethiopia and Cambodia, where negative consequences of land acquisitions on development and social peace are particularly prev- alent. Moreover, the participants discussed to what extent the newly developed FAO Voluntary Guide- lines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (hereafter: FAO VG on Tenure)1 are a useful tool to confront the negative consequences of land acquisitions in these and other country contexts. This report picks out some of the main issues dis- cussed at the roundtable, adds some further thoughts of the authors and refers to a limited num- ber of additional sources. The first section looks at the two most prominent ways in which adverse effects of land acquisitions are addressed: support- ing land titling processes and advocacy. The se- cond session reflects the debates on the potential of the FAO VG on Tenure as a tool to fostering sus- tainable land and water management.</style>

Yet they are facing increasing persecution from governments, who are intensifying restrictions on their freedoms. This exacerbates the already significant problem of limited access to accurate data, and points to a larger trend in which political space to challenge dispossession is shrinking.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Contradiction exists within the rationale which champions formal land titles as the most effective method of increasing security of tenure. Private title is exclusive at the point in which it is granted, and enables participation in speculative real estate markets where title-holders alone hold ultimate decision-making power. Whilst prosperous land-owners may become more secure, poor farmers are made particularly vulnerable as they become pressured to sell land in the face of increasing debt or hardship. In this way the most vulnerable households become dispossessed of their land, with no legal recourse, as they are complicit in their own dispossession.; Formalisation-titling-rel: One of the key contributions of the FAOs voluntary guidelines is that it addresses the complexity and plurality of tenure arrangements, and advocates for the inclusion of customary tenure. Yet, the FAO’s formal position on increasing food security advocates for investments, which are predicated upon private formal title.;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">As Vietnam continues to search for its ideal balance between Communist control and a market-led economy, land rights emerge at the forefront of the discussion concerning the tension between traditional Socialist ideals of people-owned and state managed property versus neoliberal ideals of private property rights. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, this study will explore the legal relationship between the Vietnamese state and individuals in regards to land ownership, land management, and land use rights, explaining how this relationship has changed over time with subsequent land laws. Going further, this study will focus on the 2013 land law reform and explain the major differences, if any, from past land laws and how these differences will affect the state’s right to appropriate land—often called “land grabbing”—for both public and private development. Second, through interviews, this study will also explore the roles of two international organizations, The World Bank and Action Aid Vietnam, within the current debate over land rights, exploring each organization’s relationship with the Vietnamese government and opinions regarding land grabbing and the 2013 land law. This study focuses on three major issues surrounding land in Vietnam: land valuation and unfair compensation, “public” (land seized for projects for the public good) versus “private” (land seized for projects for the benefit of an individual or company) appropriation, and corruption at both the national and local levels. These three issues will be exemplified by the case studies in Van Giang, Hai Phong, and “Green Alley,” looking at the roles of local advocates and demonstrations. Finally, this paper explores the influence of ActionAid’s land campaign and the World Bank’s Land Policy Note in the crucial period leading up to the drafting of the 2013 Land Law, which was passed by the National Assembly at the end of November. This paper will conclude with some of the major changes of the new law, including the new stipulations regarding the appropriation of land for the purposes of “economic development.”</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">OPENING PARAGRAPH OF REPORT: Land is a contested issue in Cambodia. During the Khmer Rouge regime, all cadastral records were destroyed, private property was abolished and large parts of the population were forcibly resettled or forced to flee due to the war. During the 1990s largescale refugee repatriation programmes were implemented. Over the next decades, mainly due to population growth, spontaneous settlements developed on land that was either formally part of the state domain, or of which the legal status was unclear. In 2001, a new Land Law provided the legal basis for the management and administration of land use and ownership rights. This was the official starting point of Cambodia’s comprehensive land reform. With the aim of legally securing access to land and land tenure, as essential steps in realizing basic human rights such as food and shelter, GIZ’s Land Rights Programme (LRP) has supported the Royal Government of Cambodia in their ambitious reform from the outset.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">INTRODUCTION: Throughout 2012, villagers in eastern Myanmar described land confiscation and forced displacement occurring without consultation, compensation, or, often, notification. Such displacements have taken place most frequently around natural resource extraction, industry and development projects. These include hydropower dam construction, infrastructure development, logging, mining and plantation agriculture projects that are undertaken or facilitated by various civil and military State authorities, foreign and domestic companies and armed ethnic groups. Villagers consistently report that their perspectives are excluded from the planning and implementation of these projects, which often provide little or no benefit to the local community or result in substantial, often irreversible, harm. Business and development projects have increased substantially in the wake of Myanmar government reforms and the ceasefire signed with the Karen National Union (KNU).2 While the cessation of armed conflict has made the area more accessible to investment and commercial interests, eastern Myanmar remains a highly militarized environment. In this context, where abundant resources provide lucrative opportunities for many, and a culture of coercion and impunity is entrenched after decades of war, villagers understand that demand for land carries an implicit threat. Displacement and barriers to land access arising from these projects present major challenges at the local level. Where land is forcibly taken, fenced-in, flooded, polluted, planted or built upon, the obstacles to effective local-level response are often insurmountable. Even where villagers manage to overcome barriers to organizing a response, current legislation does not provide any easily accessible mechanism to allow their complaints to be heard. Despite this, villagers employ forms of collective action that provide viable avenues to gain representation, compensation and to forestall expropriation. Villagers' ability to navigate local power dynamics and negotiate for unofficial remedies, championed in some cases by an increasingly active domestic media, is forging new and promising avenues for collective action and association. This report draws on villagers’ interviews and testimony, as well as other forms of documentation including photographs, film and audio recordings, collected by community members5 who have been trained by KHRG to report on the local human rights situation. The documentation received has been analysed for cases in which villagers' access to and use of land has been disrupted, highlights trends of abuse, and details obstructions to the formal channels of complaint or redress that villagers face. The report closes by outlining the serious consequences created by such abuses and the lack of meaningful inclusion of villagers in the making of decisions, which affect them so fundamentally. The objective of this report is to foster a better understanding of the dynamics and impacts of natural resource extraction and development projects on the ground by presenting a substantial and recent dataset of villagers’ testimonies in eastern Myanmar. This report aims to broadcast the perspectives of villagers in eastern Myanmar to actors throughout the country and the international community. The complaints recorded in this report are important, and deserve attention, first and foremost because they represent the lived experience of villagers who are being directly affected by the actions of myriad actors in a rapidly changing Myanmar. It is intended to assist all stakeholders, including Myanmar government officials, business actors, potential and current investors, and local and international non-profit organisations, as they work to: (1) acknowledge and avoid the potential for abuse caused directly or in complicity with other actors; (2) further investigate, verify and respond to allegations of abuse; (3) address the obstacles that prevent rural communities from engaging with protective frameworks; and (4) take more effective steps to ensure sustainable, community-driven development that will not destabilize efforts for peace and ethnic inclusion.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Enclosure, dispossession and displacement loom large in current debates about the recent boom in transnational farmland deals, and about Chinese agribusiness for export in particular. Often under-examined, however, are the ways that legacies of geopolitical conflict shape the inevitably uneven distribution of enclosure, dis- possession and displacement. This paper constructs a case of these ‘micro-geopolitical’ legacies by examining a Chinese rubber plant- ing ‘promotion’ project in northwestern Laos’s emerging ‘Golden Quadrangle’ development region. It argues that longstanding con- cerns about security inform the ways that local authorities deploy investment projects that are otherwise seen as examples of ‘for- eign’ land grabbing. Further, it shows that while the geographical aims of foreign agribusiness mesh with state-mediated resettlement efforts (a darker spin on the narrative of ‘win-win’ cooperation), these activities often precede current land deals rather than result from them. Chinese agribusiness in Laos’s upland interior thus appears less as a driver of displacement than a means for attempt- ing to secure in place a particular (if precarious) configuration of population and security.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Migration has become a critical issue of our times in both transnational politics and the domestic politics of countries of the North and the South. The book considers the complexities of migration in Southeast Asia from multiple perspectives. At the macro level, these complexities include the economic drivers of migration, the impact of increased environmental disasters and the impact on the movement of people and the challenges encountered, gender as an enduring but adaptive process in the discourse on migration, and the limitation of state-centric approaches while recognizing the central role the State continues to play. At the micro level, these include how decisions to migrate are made at the individual and household levels; for example, family members or individuals choosing to undertake migration for the purposes of enhancing opportunities for work and status in life offers both opportunities and risks to present and future prospects. In considering the many aspects of migrants’ risks, rights, protections and opportunities, and how they interact with social and environmental vulnerabilities, the book aims to identify important new trends, unfolding dynamics and key concerns, and propose workable approaches to their redress.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In late June and early July 2012, more than 1,000 student volunteers were dispatched to targeted provinces across the country, accompanied by officials from the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC), to implement Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen’s Order 01BB. The student volunteers were trained in basic measurement techniques, kitted out with military uniforms bearing the MLMUPC’s logo, transported by army trucks, and directed to measure land and grant land certificates to rural residents. This land titling campaign was the personal initiative of Hun Sen and as such received support from all levels of government. Funding for the campaign came from Hun Sen and his wife, as well as from key members of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP). In order to understand the effectiveness of Order 01BB in addressing land conflicts in the country, Focus on the Global South and the Heinrich Boell Foundation supported a study to document its implementation in selected areas. The main goal of this study is to shed light on the positive and negative impacts of the programme on people in rural communities. While the study is not comprehensive, it does provide an important snapshot of what is arguably Cambodia’s most ambitious land titling initiative in years. Although the study was completed in June 2013, it has taken several months to prepare it for publication.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Part of a 3 year collaboration among the national human rights institutions of the region. Each of 8 national studies aims to pull together in a simple form, updated information about large-scale land acquisitions in the region, with the aim of identifying trends, common threats, divergences and possible solutions. As well as summarising trends in investment, trade, crop development and land tenure arrangements, the studies focus on the land tenure and human rights challenges. seven national updates have been compiled based on the available literature for Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, TimorLeste and the Philippines, each following a similar format. The studies seek to summarise what laws and policies already exist in national human rights frameworks that could ensure respect for rights in large-scale land development and, on the basis of this analysis, recommend possible solutions to the problems identified.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Under the motto “old policies - new action”, in June 2012 the Cambodian Prime Minister initiated a massive land registration campaign on untitled former forest land. Unauthorised settlers and other long- term users of these lands, including those inside Economic Land Concessions, had been considered illegal before. Those of them who are poor now receive full property title by way of donation. The campaign was planned for 12 months and targets 470,000 families on 700,000 parcels comprising a total of 1,8 Mio hectares. The campaign might be extended though into the year of 2014. By January 2013 information sheets were filled for 434,014 parcels relating to 316,153 families. A total of 389,578 parcels were surveyed, comprising 505,347 hectares. A four week public display was undertaken for 183,295 parcels of 103,073 families comprising 293,348 hectares. So far, 117,548 ownership titles were distributed in the hands of the new owners. This article is a first and incomplete attempt to describe the political background, some technological and organizational issues and the current status of the campaign in terms of land surveyed, titles delivered and type of state land reclassified.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Starting in the 1990s, the Vietnamese state sought to expand and modernise the country’s urban system after four decades of anti-urban policies. This paper exam- ines the reworking of the socialist land regime that followed from this shift. It begins by explaining how new legislation and institutions combined market and socialist principles to lure domestic enterprises into realising the state’s new urban ambitions. It then shows how this hybrid reordering of policy triggered local experiments with periurban land redevelopment and new forms of alliances between the state and pri- vate capital. Using the case of the Land-for-Infrastructure mechanism, which uses land as in-kind payment for the building of infrastructure, it is found that this experiment undermines the implementing of official planning orientations and regu- lations. Finally, the paper explores the relationship between this problematic out- come and the political-economic environment within which recent land policy changes have been implemented in Vietnam.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In rural Cambodia the rampant allocation of state land to political elites and foreign investors in the form of ‘‘Economic Land Concessions (ELCs)’’— estimated to cover an area equivalent to more than 50 % of the country’s arable land—has been associated with encroachment on farmland, community forests and indigenous territories and has contributed to a rapid increase of rural landlessness. By contrast, less than 7,000 ha of land have been allotted to land-poor and landless farmers under the pilot project for ‘‘Social Land Concessions (SLCs)’’ supported by various donor agencies. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in two research sites in Kratie Province, this article sheds light on the mechanisms and discourses sur- rounding the allocation of ELCs and SLCs. Our findings suggest that large-scale and non-transparent land leases in the form of ELCs are discursively justified as land policy measures supporting national development, creating employment opportu- nities in rural areas, and restoring ‘‘degraded’’ and ‘‘non-use’’ land, while SLCs are presented by the government and its international donors as a complementary policy to reduce landlessness, alleviate rural poverty, and ensure a more equitable land distribution. We argue that the SLC pilot project is a deliberate strategy deployed by the Cambodian ruling elite to instrumentalize international aid agencies in for- malizing displacement and distributional injustices, in smoothing the adverse social impacts of their very own land policies and in minimizing resistance by dispos- sessed rural people.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS: In this paper we examine the Cambodian conception of power in order to shed light on the nature and functioning of Khmer political culture. This is not to make the point that the Cambodian language has a number of words for different aspects of power (as does English), but rather to explicate how Cambodians understand the personal basis of social power, how social power obligates individuals, and how this understanding translates into political power through the influence it has on individual (and group) behaviour towards holders of power. We set this understanding of power within the context of an evolutionary account of cultural change, and show how it facilitates the persistence of core elements of the patrimonialism that lies at the heart of Khmer politics. We begin, however, by backgrounding the events to be explained.</style>

Working Paper Series (Singapore), no. 200; Overall-rel: This article offers a cultural and historical explanation of why Cambodian society continues to replicate traditional power structures based on patronage, despite millions of dollars in international aid spent on promoting good governance. While cognisant of not presenting an essentialised Khmer political culture, the authors explores Cambodian understandings of the personal basis of social power and how it translates into political power. After identifying the various elements perceived to contribute to Cambodian conceptions of power, the authors argue that Cambodian’s view of power is in many ways oppositional to western ideals of democratic power.; Research-bas: The article is based on 87 ethnographic interviews, as well as surveys, carried out as part of research conducted for a book publication on the subject of power and gender, which included extensive historical research on power dimensions in Cambodia dating back to c. 230 C.E.; AccessToJustice-rel: There is a general reluctance amongst Cambodians to pursue legal recourse, and they are often met with violent responses from state actors when they do. The article claims there are less visible, culturally-embedded reasons why Cambodians often see challenging power as not only futile, but somehow socially unacceptable. This has significant implications when considering the efficacy of the legal system, and how laws and legal institutions are supported by international donors. The article suggests the legal system itself lacks cultural coherence for the people it is intended to serve. Ultimately, the authors argue that if Cambodians have a fatalistic understanding of hierarchical power they will be unable to see their own agency as an effective means to challenge power, and will therefore be easily deterred from seeking legal recourse. Further, laws and legal institutions in Cambodia act more as a ‘facade’ of protection, than an avenue for seeking legitimate recourse. Since the courts are perceived to be controlled by powerful actors, citizens who find themselves dispossessed of their land do not see the legal system as a means of protecting their rights.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: In Cambodia, networks of patronage are the fundamental relations that keep wealthy elites and state actors in positions of power, often at the expense of marginalised and less powerful groups and individuals. In Cambodia, those who are revered as powerful and influential are almost all men. This is perceived as part of the ‘natural’ hierarchy, and women will frequently accept that men are more powerful because they hold the majority of powerful positions. This culturally embedded understanding of dominance can be self-perpetuating.; Policy-law-rel: The article implies the need for a fundamental reorientation in how legal concepts which are central to understandings of democratic governance such as rule of law, transparency and accountability, fit with Cambodian political economies and power structures. In particular, it questions prevailing assumptions about a linear transition from authoritarian to democratic, from ‘soft’ to ‘hard’ law and ‘informal’ to ‘formal’ norms.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land rights have become highly contested in Vietnam in recent years. Vietnam‟s land endowment is one of the lowest in the world: each agricultural household holds, on average, less than 0.5 hectare. Access to land is critical to social and economic development in the future. The national priority on “industrialization and modernization” has placed new demands on agricultural and forest land for urban-industrial expansion. The high level of public concern over land tenure and its links to political and social stability have led to widespread calls for revision of the 2003 Land Law. This paper contributes to the conference thematic area of “Securing land rights and improving land use at the grassroots” by presenting the initial results of advocacy on the Land Law and land rights conducted by a multi-stakeholder coalition including Oxfam, Vietnamese domestic NGOs, government research institutes, and media. The paper begins with a political economy analysis of land rights in Vietnam, including an analysis of the draft revised Land Law, with particular focus on appropriation of agricultural land and protection of ethnic minority forest land. Next, the paper describes local and provincial consultation on the draft law conducted by the Oxfam-supported coalition and its initial results.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The overall QSEM program aims to provide a descriptive picture of rural life in Myanmar. It examines different livelihood strategies and activities, the wider factors that shape these strategies, and how the broader social and institutional features of community life affect people’s livelihoods choices and outcomes. Specifically, it explores how external assistance affects individual behavior, coping mechanisms, and community social structures. How do those social structures shape the local economic environment? How do coping mechanisms affect livelihood choices and outcomes? Assessing the ways that different sets of factors are related to each other can ultimately provide a deeper understanding of how livelihoods choices are made and how they result in different outcomes. QSEM is designed to support the monitoring and evaluation program of the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT). LIFT works in rural areas of Myanmar and provides grants to implementing partners for projects that collectively aim to improve the food security and incomes of 2 million people across Myanmar. QSEM aims to inform the strategic decision-?‐making of the LIFT Fund Board by helping the program to gain a better understanding of livelihoods needs, challenges and opportunities in LIFT target areas and how these vary by geographic area, target group and over time. This report is based on the third round of QSEM research. QSEM 3 was the first round in which all villages in the sample were revisited, so it focuses on changes at the village level, which began to emerge clearly for the first time. The changes highlight how Myanmar’s national transition may be playing out at the village level in rural areas. Although there were few significant changes in livelihood patterns, there were emerging changes in land management, village governance, and local organizing. The main findings that emerge from QSEM 3 include: (a) little change in the basics of people’s livelihoods; (b) incremental change in certain aspects of the village livelihoods context and new dynamics around recurrent challenges, particularly in land but also in labor and credit; (c) perceived intensification in the kinds of problems and shocks people face and some changes in coping, particularly in migration; and (d) flux in village governance, collective bargaining and other aspects of village institutions. As in previous rounds, there was regional variance in all these areas.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In Rubber Barons, Global Witness documents the devastating impact of Vietnam’s rush for rubber on local communities in Laos and Cambodia. The investigation also shows how international financiers Deutsche Bank and the International Finance Corporation were backing these land grabs – often in contravention of their own policies. In both Laos and Cambodia, national laws are supposed to protect forests, limit the size of foreign land concessions and require consultation with local communities over land use, but these laws are rarely enforced. Millions of hectares of land have been handed over without the knowledge or consent of the people who live on it.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">With a view to operationalizing the recently adopted Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Forests and Fisheries, this paper identifies gaps in existing World Bank safeguard policies with respect to tenure. The paper explores the adverse impacts on security of tenure for vulnerable groups resulting from a land administration project in Cambodia, and explains how oil a series of oil palm projects in Papua New Guinea resulted in a shift away from a flexible and equitable tenure governance system to a more rigid individualized system that has made some land users more vulnerable. In both cases, existing Bank safeguard policies did not effectively avoid and mitigate the adverse impacts on tenure or the consequential harms to affected people and communities. The paper outlines new safeguard measures proposed by Oxfam and Inclusive Development International that aim to prevent and mitigate negative impacts on tenure, whilst promoting greater security across the continuum of tenure forms and more equitable access to and control over land, housing and natural resources.</style>

In Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty (pp. 1–23). The World Bank.; Overall-rel: This paper uses two case studies to argue that championing registered private land ownership as the way to increase security of tenure for vulnerable groups is fundamentally flawed. The authors describe the plurality of existing tenure arrangements, particularly among ethnic minorities, and highlight the ways in which imposing singular, private, and formalised land titling undermines the informal, flexible, and context specific arrangements which accommodate the shared interests of such groups. The case studies illustrate how land privatisation programs can become subject to elite capture and strengthen the control of land by powerful state and economic actors, and serve to further marginalise the most vulnerable groups. This paper provides an excellent critique of the neoliberal rationale for the privatisation of tenure as essential to the promotion of economic growth.; Research-bas: This paper is based on two case studies: one examining the impacts of the Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP) project in Cambodia, and one examining the impacts of oil palm projects in Papua New Guinea. The case studies are used as examples in which World Bank programs have caused unintended negative impacts. The author uses these examples to support a detailed critical analysis of the Bank’s own existing safeguard policies in an effort to draw attention to significant gaps and to make recommendations about new measures to mitigate such adverse impacts. The paper recommends linking the review process with the FAOs Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in an effort to make the voluntary guidelines more binding.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Programs that have sought to extend security of tenure to vulnerable groups by granting legal land title have frequently effected the precise opposite. Such programs either formalise already existing tenure agreements by dictating household headship – a process that plays a significant role in undermining women’s claims to land title – or divide plots otherwise shared in common into private plots allocated to particular individuals.; Formalisation-titling-rel: The debate on tenure security has often been reduced to one which frames two kinds of land users: those who are vulnerable, and without any formal tenure, and those who are secure, and in possession of formal land title. This overly simplistic duality effectively ignores the multiplicity of tenure arrangements. Moreover, efforts to formalise land through titles may create greater insecurity, particularly in contexts where there is little legal protection of customary land tenure.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Customary tenure arrangements are common amongst ethnic minorities. Privatisation of tenure affects these groups in particular because they destabilise their collective management arrangements, as well as their complex and culturally embedded relationship to land.;</style>

In Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty (pp. 1–23). The World Bank.; Overall-rel: This paper uses two case studies to argue that championing registered private land ownership as the way to increase security of tenure for vulnerable groups is fundamentally flawed. The authors describe the plurality of existing tenure arrangements, particularly among ethnic minorities, and highlight the ways in which imposing singular, private, and formalised land titling undermines the informal, flexible, and context specific arrangements which accommodate the shared interests of such groups. The case studies illustrate how land privatisation programs can become subject to elite capture and strengthen the control of land by powerful state and economic actors, and serve to further marginalise the most vulnerable groups. This paper provides an excellent critique of the neoliberal rationale for the privatisation of tenure as essential to the promotion of economic growth.; Research-bas: This paper is based on two case studies: one examining the impacts of the Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP) project in Cambodia, and one examining the impacts of oil palm projects in Papua New Guinea. The case studies are used as examples in which World Bank programs have caused unintended negative impacts. The author uses these examples to support a detailed critical analysis of the Bank’s own existing safeguard policies in an effort to draw attention to significant gaps and to make recommendations about new measures to mitigate such adverse impacts. The paper recommends linking the review process with the FAOs Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in an effort to make the voluntary guidelines more binding.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Programs that have sought to extend security of tenure to vulnerable groups by granting legal land title have frequently effected the precise opposite. Such programs either formalise already existing tenure agreements by dictating household headship – a process that plays a significant role in undermining women’s claims to land title – or divide plots otherwise shared in common into private plots allocated to particular individuals.; Formalisation-titling-rel: The debate on tenure security has often been reduced to one which frames two kinds of land users: those who are vulnerable, and without any formal tenure, and those who are secure, and in possession of formal land title. This overly simplistic duality effectively ignores the multiplicity of tenure arrangements. Moreover, efforts to formalise land through titles may create greater insecurity, particularly in contexts where there is little legal protection of customary land tenure.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Customary tenure arrangements are common amongst ethnic minorities. Privatisation of tenure affects these groups in particular because they destabilise their collective management arrangements, as well as their complex and culturally embedded relationship to land.;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In the context of transition to a more open form of government, the Myanmar government has begun to liberalize land markets and, in 2012, enacted two major land-related laws. Implementing these new land laws has proven challenging, however, as it has been difficult to integrate these laws with the existing customary practices of various ethnic minorities. To address these and other issues UN-HABITAT Myanmar is assisting the Myanmar government in developing a Land Administration and Management Program (LAMP). As part of this process, the SIPA team conducted a detailed study on customary land tenure in the southern area of Myanmar’s Shan State with a focus on three ethnic groups: the Shan, Pa-o and Danu. The goal of the study was to present UN-HABITAT Myanmar and the Myanmar government with needed information on three topics: 1) prevailing ideas on best practices in land management and registration procedures, 2) successful and unsuccessful land management practices in comparable countries in the region, and 3) the current status of customary land tenure and of the implementation process of the new land laws in Southern Shan State.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodia is currently experiencing profound processes of rural change, driven by an emerging trend of large-scale land deals. This article discusses potential future pathways by analyzing two contrasting visions and realities of land use: the aim of the governmental elites to foster surplus-producing rural areas for overall economic growth, employment creation and ultimately poverty reduction, and the attempts of smallholders to maintain and create livelihoods based on largely self-sufficient rural systems. Based on the MuSIASEM approach, the rural economy of Cambodia and different rural system types are analyzed by looking at their metabolic pattern in terms of land use, human activity, and produced and consumed flows. The analysis shows that the pathways of self-sufficiency and surplus production are largely not compatible in the long term. Cambodia's rural labor force is expected to increase enormously over the next decades, while available land for the smallholder sector has become scarce due to the granting of Economic Land Concessions (ELC). Consequently, acceleration in rural-urban migration may be expected, accompanied by a transition from self-employed smallholders to employment-dependent laborers. If the ELC system achieves to turn the reserved land into viable agribusinesses, it might enable added value creation; however, it does not bring substantial amounts of employment opportunities to rural areas. On the contrary, ELC have high opportunity costs in terms of rural livelihoods based on smallholder land uses and thus drive the marginalization of Cambodian smallholders. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Following such collection and compilation of relevant information on issues of women’s land rights, this report begins by introducing the centrality of the issue of women’s land rights, the developments in this context, and the remaining challenges with respect to complying on Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the CEDAW on the particular issue of women’s access to land and related resources. This is followed by recommendations for various key actors who are involved in ensuring the related compliance. One key point noted in this report is that while formal guarantees exist in law and practice, enshrining women’s access to land – a key resource which can form the basis of their social welfare, substantively, this has not been the case in practice. Culture and prevailing practices have resulted in women being ill-informed of their land and resource rights and unable to have the relevant laws and policies enacted for their benefit. Moreover, the issue has been further complicated by large-scale land acquisition, which has taken place without the provision of free, informed and prior consent of the people or adequate, just compensation. Women, who are most vulnerable, are unable to resist such acquisition, which can lead to the dispossession of their land and livelihood, and can cause a further descent into poverty due to the accumulated debts and migration they have to undertake in order to find some means to support themselves and their families. At the end, as ILC Director, Dr. Madiodio Niasse says, there is “no ready-made solution” to address the issue of land reforms and access to land and related resources for the different populations and groups in a country. Instead, equitable and fair access to land and resources can be only formed on the basis of “socially negotiated decision-making”, and women as equal members of our society need to have a say in this decision-making. Equally, women need to be heard in order to ensure their equal rights and guarantee to the land and resources of our country.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Siamese Rovsewood (Dalbergia cochinensis) has recently been listed on Appendix II of The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This listing means that source countries are legally required to export only controlled quantities of rosewood with close monitoring and documentation, which is intended to ensure that the international trade is not detrimental to the survival of this species. This briefing note outlines the socio-economic context of illegal cross-border rosewood logging in the Cambodian–Lao border region, identifying the main factors that prompt local involvement in this activity, as well as broader implications for forest governance in both countries. The analysis draws upon two data sources: (i) four months of fieldwork in 2009 in a Cambodian village (‘Sekong Village’) in the border district of Siem Pang, Stung Treng Province, where rosewood logging has been common; and (ii) literature review and media monitoring through to early 2013 relating to rosewood logging in the region.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since the early 1960s, notwithstanding dire predictions of agricultural theorists and colonial observers, agricultural growth has been strong among most Southeast Asian countries. More recently, this expansion has reached the maritime domain, with the rapid development of aquatic production through sea-based aquaculture among others. In recent territorial expansion and increase in yields for export crops has been faster than for food crops. The growing submission of the region’s agricultures to the demands of the global market goes hand with the increasing role played by agro-food multinationals which are replacing the states in monitoring the national agricultural domains, pioneer fronts included.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This report on Myanmar's political economy of timber trade highlights five different sources and flows of timber destined for export. The purpose is to bring to light the different actors, geographies, and politics embedded within the web of timber flows because each inter-connected stream has its own degree of legality, sustainability, land rights regimes, and ethical sourcing. To date, much of the dialogue on the sourcing of Myanmar timber - particularly the world-famous Burmese teak - has focused on just one of these streams: the government-managed teak forests located in the central plains. However, the other timber sources and actors need to be highlighted, too - and their legality, sustainability, and ethics - as exported timber is an amalgamation of all possible wood sources. The complicated wood trade dynamics outlined in this report need to be made more transparent by the Myanmar government and the domestic private wood sector to provide more clear guidelines for overseas buyers demanding legal, sustainable, and ethical wood sourcing. This, in turn, will provide further impetus for the on-going forest sector reform process in the country.</style>

Among the land-related problems that emerge during and after conflict are the exploitation of land-based resources in the absence of authority, the disintegration of property rights and institutions, the territorial effect of battlefield gains and losses, and population displacement. In the wake of violent conflict, reconstitution of a viable land-rights system is crucial: an effective post-conflict land policy can foster economic recovery, help restore the rule of law, and strengthen political stability. But the reestablishment of land ownership, land use, and access rights for individuals and communities is often complicated and problematic, and poor land policies can lead to renewed tensions. In twenty-one chapters by twenty-five authors, this book considers experiences with, and approaches to, post-conflict land issues in seventeen countries and in varied social and geographic settings. Highlighting key concepts that are important for understanding how to address land rights in the wake of armed conflict, the book provides a theoretical and practical framework for policy makers, researchers, practitioners, and students. Land and Post-Conflict Peacebuilding is part of a global initiative to identify and analyze lessons in post-conflict peacebuilding and natural resource management. The project has generated six edited books of case studies and analyses, with contributions from practitioners, policy makers, and researchers. Other books in the series address high-value resources, water, livelihoods, assessing and restoring resources, and governance.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Production of commodities for global markets is an increasingly important factor of tropical deforestation, taking over smallholders subsistence farming. Measures to reduce deforestation and convert shifting cultivation systems towards permanent crops have recently been strengthened in several countries. But these changes have variable environmental and social impacts, including on ethnic minorities. In Vietnam, although a forest transition - i.e. shift from shrinking to expanding forest cover - occurred at the national scale, deforestation fronts and agricultural colonization for commodity crops - a.o. coffee - still dominated the Central Highlands plateaus. Previous studies suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were on the one hand the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households - the majority ethnic group in Vietnam - and on the other hand the corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000-2010. Land use changes were linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached -0.31%y-1 of the total area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and other perennial crops over agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants, pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late 2000s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net losses of natural forest. Implications for policies that may affect deforestation are discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">OPENING PARAGRAPH OF EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Whereas 2011 had seen a sharp increase in the number of Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) granted by the Royal Government of Cambodia to private companies, in 2012 conflicts became more acute and protests multiplied. The government showed that it had understood the seriousness of the situation by taking initiatives aimed at resolving land disputes, addressing some of the issues related to ELCs and granting thousands of land titles to rural families. However, some of the most pressing concerns about the overall pressure on land, landlessness, land tenure insecurity, lack of law enforcement, power abuses, and encroachment on livelihoods and natural resources remained unaddressed. This report is intended to be comprehensive. It deals with land concessions, land disputes, forced evictions and encroachment on natural resources from a human rights and development perspective. However, extractive industries are beyond its scope. The report first sheds light on the gap between the Cambodian legal framework and the reality with regard to land, housing and natural resources rights. It stresses that this gap is extremely significant, due to Cambodian authorities’ failure to implement the law. Second, the report analyzes the consequences of rights violations in terms of land tenure security, landlessness, poverty, livelihoods and related issues. Third, it examines conflict resolution processes and institutions, and the practice. It puts emphasis on the mounting crackdown on rights activists. Last, the report provides a preliminary analysis of the initiatives taken by the Royal Government of Cambodia in 2012. The report features detailed recommendations to the government, business enterprises and Cambodia’s development partners.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Two opposing land tenure policies are being implemented in upland Cambodia: indigenous communal title, the product of a decade of advocacy for indigenous rights; and Order 01, a dramatic new initiative to provide private individual titles to thousands of farmers living on state public land. This policy conflict has precipitated painful deliberations in Indigenous villages, whereby the merits of inalienable communal title must be weighed against its risks and constraints; and individual titles must be scrutinised for their potential to accelerate alienation and render frontier areas legible' for government and markets. I examine these issues through the experiences of one villagein Mondulkiri, which recently reconciled' its communal title claim with the new individually motivated reforms. The village exemplifies Cambodia's commodity frontier: it is of mixed Bunong-Khmer ethnicity, and has undergone rapid deforestation and market integration since 2005.Thus, when the individual titling commenced in 2012, the already-fragile communal land claim was abandoned by 25% of its constituents. I explore how this unfolded, revealing powerful moral and racial narratives around Bunong identity and the processes of land fragmentation, commodification and alienation. I also reveal how these processes are enabled by Cambodia's predatory regime, of which Order 01 is an intimate part.</style>

Available at: http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/apv.12027 [Accessed January 7, 2015]; Research-bas: The article is based on an ethnographic study of O Rona village in Mondolkiri village in eastern Cambodia. The author, a Khmer speaking Australian anthropologist, conducted her research during her work in the area between mid-2012 and early 2013 with the Wildlife Conservation Society through an academic project. The encounter between individual and communal land titling provided what the author describes as a “natural experiment” in which local responses and tensions could be investigated. The data was collected through 25 interviews, three focus groups, and participatory exercises in mapping and wealth ranking;ZZZ;ZZZ;CivilSociety-Donors-rel: Civil society has seen indigenous communal land title as a solution to land alienation.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Market-based interventions to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) enable the carbon stored in land and forests to be traded as a new and intangible form of property. Using examples from Cambodia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, we examine the property negotiations underpinning this new forest carbon economy. We show that the institutions and land use negotiations needed to ‘produce’ forest carbon interact recursively with existing property claims over land and forests. Even where customary rights are formally recognized (PNG, Philippines), claims to forest carbon are still complicated by ambiguities and complexities surrounding rights to forested land. Meanwhile the new value attached to forest carbon can stimulate efforts to appropriate land and forest resources associated with it, creating new power relations and property dynamics. This interplay between forest carbon and underlying contested property claims in rural forest settings creates an unstable basis for forest carbon markets and raises questions about future access to forested land.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The issue of women’s access to land is often framed in the context of oppression, emancipation, or Vietnamese uniqueness. This study report examines contemporary women’s access to land across ten provinces outside of these traditional narratives. Ten selected research sites reflected a diveristy of rural-urban locations, lineage patterns, and ethnic diversity. In addition to the survey data, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions, the Research Team analyzed available court cases involving inheritance and succession issues in the Vietnamese courts, from the district through Supreme Court levels. In order for any outreach program to function well, the Research Team suggested that any initiative undertaken to improve women’s land rights should seek to 1) improve the content and communication strategies of outreach programs; 2) encourage and support women in registering their land rights and to use land transfer documents; and 3) raise the standard of basic legal services in communities throughout Vietnam. Initiating an outreach pilot program that is governed by the principles of inclusiveness, diversity, and clarity is also recommended.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">With the onset of the market economy in 1988, after the SLORC government announced that Myanmar was going to be a market-economy, assumed that agriculture productivity was low and concluded that existing land resources were not fully utilized by farmers who were lacking investment. In 1993, the government created a new policy of promoting private investment in agriculture production, called the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Instructions, or ‘Wasteland Instructions’. If the land was developed, more land could be granted up to a maximum of 50,000 acres. Since the introduction of contract-farming into Myanmar, no systematic efforts have been made by relevant government agencies review or assess their performance. Government policy to allocate land to private companies was based on an untested assumption that private companies would make better use of this land than small holders. According to the Department of Agricultural Planning, a total of 1.9 million acres have been granted to 204 companies by 2011, with half of that in Tanintharyi and Kachin State, a huge jump from 225,242 acres since 1999; the land actually developed and cultivated by the companies are only 35.6 % and 20 % of total respectively. There is a clear danger for smallholder farmers in Myanmar, whose tenure rights are not secure and whose high debt levels put them at continual risk of stress sales leading to loss of access to land for sustainable livelihoods. Instead of creating institutions to support these farmers to become more productive in a free-exchange market, where farmers are supported by choice, information and affordable inputs, the new laws place a number of restrictions on farmers so that it will be even harder for them to retain their land. For example, most farmers do not even know how to register their land with the new Land Central Management Committee. Upland farmers that have been governed by customary land tenure, with no knowledge of statutory laws until now are facing the greatest threats of land confiscation. To better understand the experiences faced by farmers in this transitional context, farming communities that are involved in land confiscation cases were documented from 13 villages across three townships in June and July 2012. Objectives: The objectives of the study are to: (a) Share farmers’ voices to decision-makers to help decision-makers reform policies that will meet the needs of their constituents (b) Inform the design of policies that will strengthen land tenure security for farmers in Myanmar Methodology</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Through LMAP, and subsequent LASSP, Cambodia has made impressive progress in building a functioning cadastral system over the last ten years. This process has proved complex and challenging, but since commencing, the land registration teams have successfully issued over 1.7 million land titles, a strong legal framework has been developed for the functioning of the land administration bodies and mechanism, institutions have been built and strengthened, and a dispute resolution process has been established for dealing with disputes over unregistered land. Although these achievements are largely down to the hard work of the MLMUPC and its associated departments, the swift progress was made possible with the financial and technical support of numerous development partners. Despite these considerable achievements there have been set-backs and challenges along the way, many of which have been discussed elsewhere in academic literature, civil society and media reports. There is evidence that despite the development of a comprehensive legal framework and experienced institutions, the mechanisms established have been implemented more successfully in some areas than in others. In this study the authors sought to assess how the SLR process was implemented in four study areas, two urban and two rural, in Phnom Penh, Banteay Meanchey, Preah, Sihanouk and Kampong Cham. In particular the study sought to gather more information on the issues of exclusion, dispute resolution and subsequent registration.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper uses four years of panel data on 793 households collected during 2001–11 to measure chronic poverty in rural Cambodia and to identify its key determinants. A household wealth index—a proxy for long-term welfare—constructed by polychoric principal component analysis is used as welfare indicator. Both ordered logistic and multinomial logistic regression models are adopted to identify the causes of chronic and transient poverty by focusing particularly on five explanatory variables: agricultural land and livestock, demography, human capital, social capital and natural resources. To ensure the robustness of our results, two poverty lines are applied: 40th percentile and 60th percentile of the wealth index. The findings indicate that households experiencing chronic poverty account for only 4–10 percent of the total sample, while transient poverty affects 40–52 percent. Among the total poor households, transient poverty is 84–90 percent. Our ordered logistic regression reveals that the composition of household size, the education of the household head, social capital (i.e. connection with three or more people in the community), agricultural land and livestock are likely to be the most important factors that help the chronically poor to move into better off groups. Common property resources seem to have an opposite effect. Multinomial logistic regression results reconfirm that household composition, particularly the number of children aged 7–14 years and females aged 15–64 years, the education of the household head, agricultural land and livestock play an important role in reducing the likelihood of chronic poverty. It appears that education, agricultural land and livestock would also help to reduce transient poverty. Social capital is likely to be strongly correlated with both transient poverty and being never poor.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">A key problem facing slum dwellers is tenure insecurity - as well as the threat of eviction, residents are excluded from many services extended to legal residents, from water connections to public schooling. Thailand's Baan Mankong slum upgrading program adopts a people-driven approach to resolving problems of insecure housing and poor living conditions, putting slum residents at the core of the process. This paper explores, through interviews, how residents in four Bangkok communities perceive the outcomes of upgrading, particularly their new homes and tenure situation. Participant satisfaction is key to ensuring successful scaling up of Baan Mankong, as this is done through community-driven exchange and learning-by-doing. The results show that while the respondents appreciate their new houses and improved living environment, they are wary of the resulting debt burden. While tenure is regarded as secure in the short term, the long-term situation is not so clear. Homes cannot be sold on outside the community, and therefore Baan Mankong is valued more for improving shelter and strengthening community cohesiveness, rather than as a profit-driven financial investment.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Although Cambodia is one of Asia’s smallest and poorest economies—in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) only Burma’s per capita purchasing power is lower—changes in its environment for business and trade since the turn of the millennium have been rapid and dramatic. Insiders and outsiders alike are increasingly recognizing the country’s economic potential as a range of new investment and infrastructure projects evince growing confidence and opportunity. Cambodia’s situation at the heart of a regional market incorporating Vietnam, Southern China, Thailand, and Laos, as well as ASEAN more broadly, bodes well for its agricultural value chains, including rice, aquaculture, livestock, and spices. A member of the World Trade Organization since 2004, Cambodia has enacted a number of commerce-friendly laws. For example, the country allows up to 100 percent foreign ownership in most sectors. Notwithstanding these advances, the majority of Cambodia’s 15.2 million people continue to work in low-productivity, subsistence agriculture, although the industrial and service sectors (garments and tourism most prominent among them) now provide more than 40 percent of jobs and account for 64 percent of GDP. Agriculture and food security remain of critical concern, with the country’s most vexing political and economic issues centering on land, infrastructure, access to finance, and human capacity. Indeed, institutions charged with implementing policy and legal changes tend to lack resources and awareness of best practice in governance and accountability.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodia is highly dependent on agriculture: the agricultural sector is responsible for more than 30 percent of GDP and provides employment for more than 70 percent of people who are employed (ADB 2011). Given such high dependence on agriculture, an important question is, &quot;How will Cambodia be affected by climate change, especially the agricultural sector?&quot; Climate change, by definition, will alter temperature and rainfall patterns. Since agriculture is dependent on weather, and crops are known to suffer yield losses when temperatures are too high, there is concern that climate warming will lower crop yields. Changes in rainfall might also cause reductions in yields, though in some places changes in rainfall could lead to increases in yields. Finally, rising seas may results in inundation and salinization of soils, causing loss of currently productive agricultural land. ADB and IFPRI (2009) recently studied the impact of climate change on agriculture in countries of Asia and the Pacific, concluding that &quot;a combination of indicator values representing exposure (change in temperature and precipitation), sensitivity (share of labor in agriculture), and adaptive capacity (poverty)&quot; makes Cambodia one of the seven countries in the region that are most vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we further the analysis by focusing specifically on Cambodia, and by using newer data and finer spatial resolution, broadening the range of crops studied, and considering the potential impact of several key adaptation options. The report also includes a comprehensive overview of Cambodian agriculture prepared by CDRI, as well as a summary and recommendations (Chapter 3) provided by the Ministry of Environment relating to climate change and its effects in Cambodia.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The author argues that the democratic reform in Myanmar is rooted in profound internal and external factors. Since the beginning of the reform, the changes in Myanmar have taken tolls in a series of China’s existing interests inside the country. Economically, Chinese investments have come under increasing scrutiny, criticism, and even oppositions, threatening the viability of strategic projects such as the oil and gas pipelines. Politically, the initial success of the democratic reform in Myanmar raises questions about Beijing’s continuous resistance to reform. Strategically, the changes in Myanmar undercut China’s original blueprint about the strategic utilities of Myanmar for China at ASEAN, in the Indian Ocean and more broadly in the region. In light of the changes, China has adjusted its policy toward Myanmar. Not only has Beijing dramatically reduced its economic invest- ments in Myanmar, it also cooled down the political ties while established relations with the democratic oppositions. At the same time, China also launched massive public relations campaigns inside Myanmar aimed at im- proving its image and relations with the local communities.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land distribution to the poor is discussed in the broader context of the Cambodian land reform which is considered to follow a liberal approach based on the re-introduction of private property rights in land following Cambodia’s socialist period. This approach has produced good results for providing private land titles for existing land use on state private land but has turned out to be quantitatively ineffective in the distribution of state public land for the poor through social land concessions. Experiences from the ongoing donor-funded project on land allocation for economic and social development (LASED) show the necessity for a more complex political, legal and spatially-planned approach and for a mix of new instruments that include the regularisation of unauthorised land use by the poor and partnerships between big and small holders.</style>

Commune-based land allocation for poverty reduction in Cambodia: Achievements and lessons learned from the project ‘Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED)’. Paper presented at the ‘Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty’, The World Bank, Washington D.C, 23-26 April, 2012. ; Overall-rel: This paper examines some of the challenges and opportunities of land reform for poverty reduction in Cambodia from the perspective of international donors. The paper gives an insight to why land distribution for the poor through social land concessions has largely failed in Cambodia. It also draws attention, though perhaps inadvertently, to how donors respond to setbacks to the reforms they initiate by introducing ever more complex legal and political instruments. The article highlights the unexhausted capacity for regulatory innovation within the Cambodian legal system, but it also calls into question the expectations among donors of continuous, forward or upward movement in the condition of a nation’s laws and institutions.; Research-bas: The paper discusses experiences of the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED) program, funded by GIZ and the World Bank, from the perspective of someone closely involved in its implementation.; Formalisation-titling-rel: In Cambodia, land reforms have made significant progress in formalising land rights of the rural poor through the issuing of titles for the state private land already used. Systematic land registration has enabled de facto use of state private land to be legally transformed and formalised as de jure private ownership of agricultural and residential parcels, providing land tenure security a large number of Cambodians in the rural lowlands. However, systematic land registration has not been able to resolve conflicts on and around state public land, which is mainly in the peripheral highlands. As a result, these areas have often been excluded from registration and farmers have lost their lands to concessions and other encroachers.; Distribution-rel: State land for distribution in Cambodia has been extremely unequal, with the vast majority of state public land distributed to a small number of domestic and foreign companies in the form of large-scale economic land concessions, and a very small portion of land going to rural poor households as social land concessions.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: The introduction of land markets as part of neoliberal reforms has not safeguarded the interests of the poor. State public land is mostly in the upland areas, where most of the indigenous communities have historically resided. This land has largely remained untitled, leaving these areas open to encroachment. The donor-supported program to distribute land to the landless and land-poor in Cambodia has not been a success. Even when land has been legally allocated to the poor through the social land concession system, the lengthy process has left the land open to encroachment. Moreover, poor households that have been able to obtain land have had no capital to invest in land clearing, preparation and farming.; Policy-law-rel: The paper attributes Cambodia’s land distribution failure to two main factors. The first is insufficient implementation of the rule of law. For example, government officials have not always followed regulations with regard to granting economic land concessions. Local authorities have also had difficulties implementing the rule of law for allocating social land concessions as individuals and state institutions have encroached on the land. The second factor is inadequate policies, legal regulations and instruments. The paper lists a number of new legal instruments, which donors are trying to implement in order to regularise poor encroachers, avoid exclusions from the systematic land registration process, and build partnerships between economic land concessions and smallholder farmers.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This publication presents the first nationwide analysis of land concessions and leases in the Lao PDR. It comes at a pivotal moment after investment in land has expanded significantly throughout the country, sparking increased dialogue and a greater level of scrutiny regarding the impacts of this expan- sion, both inside the Government of the Lao PDR (GoL) and throughout wider civil society. Investment in land, particularly foreign direct investment, has been championed as an effective development tool by a number of actors. Such significant transformations in national landscapes, however, could engender drastic socioeconomic and environmental change, affect food security and traditional livelihoods and could ultimately pose challenges to national sovereignty. The inventory represents a globally unique and extremely valuable database from various perspectives. It is the first sys- tematic inventory that allows capturing, visualizing and analysing the extent and dimensions of the concession phenomenon for the entire country. The inventory data presented in this publication... has been collected at various administrative levels and in a spatially explicit manner wherever possible, allowing for its combination with other national level data in order to provide further insight into the contexts in which land concessions and leases occur in the Lao PDR.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">PUBLISHER'S ABSTRACT: This report discusses the political, economic and social opportunities and constraints that will influence the design and implementation of REDD+ in Vietnam. In particular, four major direct drivers (land conversion for agriculture; infrastructure development; logging (illegal and legal); forest fire) and three indirect drivers (pressure of population growth and migration; the state's weak forest management capacity; the limited funding available for forest protection) of deforestation and degradation in Vietnam are discussed, along with their implications for REDD+. These drivers and their impacts vary from region to region, and change over time. No &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; formula will function across the whole of Vietnam. The report also examines the lessons learnt from various forestry and economic development policies and programmes and suggests how a future REDD+ mechanism can overcome the major challenges, which include limited funding for forest protection, weak local governance capacity, poor vertical and horizontal coordination, low involvement of the poor, women and indigenous groups, low economic returns, elite capture of land and benefits, and corruption. The report suggests that if REDD+ is to succeed, it must be participatory, that is, all players are given fair and ample opportunity to be part of the programme (particularly those with the least resources or the greatest economic disenfranchisement); transparent, that is, all players can trace how the programme is administered, including the distribution of benefits; and well-monitored, to ensure that the programme is conducted such that it meets its overarching objectives and guidelines. The success of REDD+ will also require that it take a pro-poor and pro-gender equity approach.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land deals are frequently agreed in secret between governments and investors. This lack of transparency in the allocation of land fosters an environment where elite capture of natural assets becomes the norm, where human rights are routinely abused with impunity, where environmental destruction is ignored and where investment incentives are stacked against companies willing to adhere to ethical and legal principles. Dealing with Disclosure, produced in conjunction with the International Land Coalition and the Oakland Institute, sets out for the first time in detail what governments, companies and citizens can do to ensure against the negative impacts of secretive land deals. The report’s key recommendation is that all contractual information be made publicly available unless investors or governments can prove this would harm commercial competitiveness or public interest – a principle it calls “if in doubt, disclose”. Companies should have to prove their operations are doing no harm, rather than communities with little information or power having to prove that a land deal is negatively affecting them. The report also reveals how opening up the process around large-scale land deals would not only benefit local communities but also governments and investors. Investors would enjoy a level playing field, reduced risks of corruption, and expensive and damaging conflicts with communities. Greater transparency would also enable governments to make more informed decisions and negotiate better deals when allocating commercial rights to land.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">We draw on empirical results from three case studies of property rights change across forest and fisheries ecosystems in central Vietnam to investigate the circumstances under which collective property rights may make sense. A generic property rights framework was used to examine the bundles of rights and associated rights holders in each case, and to assess these arrangements with regard to their contextual fit, legitimacy and enforceability. The cases illustrate the interactions between private and collective rights to lands and resources, and the trade-offs inherent with different mixes of rights. © content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Evidences from all the four case studies in Cambodia suggest that the granting of Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) usually overlapped the land local people claimed. The scope of overlapping ranges from farmland to homestead land. Indigenous People communities in particular are prone to such overlapping due to their conventional land use such as practice of shifting cultivation and their livelihoods are also vulnerable since they are more reliant on common resources such as forest. The overlap between the ELCs and the community people’s lands leads to land conflicts between the company and the villagers. These conflicts mainly result from the way in which the ELCs are granted. In general, the granting process of the ELCs does not comply with the procedure outlined in the Sub-decree on ELCs. The evidence reveals that the site identification of the ELCs is usually not participatory, or in other words, public consultation with territorial authorities and the local people were not conducted. On the other hand, while the Sub-decree requires the ESIA be completed before the granting of the ELCs, in many cases the ESIA were only conducted following the ELC lease agreement. Moreover, the quality of the ESIA is not good though it was studied prior to the contract. However, the study also finds that land conflicts in some cases are also due to encroachment from the local residents and the immigrant settlers.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper attempts to contribute to the understanding of the impacts of secure rural agricultural land rights on labour structural transformation from agriculture to non-agriculture as well as on urbanization, with a specific focus on Thailand. Using province-level panel data and instrumental variable strategy, partial land right entitlement (known in Thailand as SPK4-01 titling) is found to have a positive impact on labour movement towards the non-agricultural sector. In particular, approximately 27 per cent of this impact can be explained by enhanced farm productivity. This, in addition, implies that the reduction of the opportunity costs of off-farm employment, which is also a predicted positive impact of titling on non-agricultural employment, should account for the rest of the overall impact on labour structural transformation Although SPK4-01 titling alone is found to have no significant effect on urbanization, its impact depends significantly on within-province transport infrastructure. More specifically, rural land right security increases urbanization more in provinces with poorer road networks. In other words, secure land rights lead to urban concentration and urban non-farm diversification only when it is relatively costly to commute within the province.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The highlands of mainland Southeast Asia have famously been the locus of “Zomia,” polities resistant to control by lowland nation-states, but this relative resilience has been due to their marginality. However, as even remote borderlands connect to the market economies of what has been labeled the “Greater Mekong Subregion,” these semi-independent polities are trying to transform themselves from isolated drug enclaves into regional paragons of economic modernity labeled “Special Economic Zones.” The main actors in this transformation are ethnic Chinese migrant capitalists who embrace the economic rhetoric of mainland China's “growth model” to create respectability and to evoke images of a cosmopolitan future as they build casinos in the rainforest. The zones’ claim to be the vanguard of modernity rests on two mutually contradictory sets of symbols: a mimicry of Chinese state paraphernalia designed to conjure up the efficacy of a strong developmental state, and the discourse of freedom from state control. This article examines the transformation of zones of political and criminal resistance into zones of economic development from a historical perspective of changing practices of sovereignty and shifting understandings of development.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper investigates the real financial consequences of investing in land with disputed tenure rights. It demonstrates that companies which ignore the issue of land tenure expose themselves to substantial, and in some cases extreme, risks. Using case study analysis, the paper connects ground-up financial thinking with empirical reality. In so doing, it makes a strong case for the need to integrate tenure-related risks more comprehensively into our financial architecture.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Northern Burma’s borderlands have undergone dramatic changes in the last two decades. Three main and interconnected developments are simultaneously taking place in Shan State and Kachin State: (1) the increase in opium cultivation in Burma since 2006 after a decade of steady decline; (2) the increase at about the same time in Chinese agricultural investments in northern Burma under China’s opium substitution programme, especially in rubber; and (3) the related increase in dispossession of local communities’ land and livelihoods in Burma’s northern borderlands. The vast majority of the opium and heroin on the Chinese market originates from northern Burma. Apart from attempting to address domestic consumption problems, the Chinese government also has created a poppy substitution development programme, and has been actively promoting Chinese companies to take part, offering subsidies, tax waivers, and import quotas for Chinese companies. The main benefits of these programmes do not go to (ex-)poppy growing communities, but to Chinese businessmen and local authori- ties, and have further marginalised these communities. Serious concerns arise regarding the long-term economic benefits and costs of agricultural development— mostly rubber—for poor upland villagers. Economic benefits derived from rubber development are very limited. Without access to capital and land to invest in rubber concessions, upland farmers practicing swidden cultivation (many of whom are (ex-) poppy growers) are left with few alternatives but to try to get work as wage labourers on the agricultural concessions. Land tenure and other related resource management issues are vital ingredients for local communities to build licit and sustainable livelihoods. Investment-induced land dispossession has wide implications for drug production and trade, as well as border stability. Investments related to opium substitution should be carried out in a more sustainable, transparent, accountable and equitable fashion. Customary land rights and institu- tions should be respected. Chinese investors should use a smallholder plantation model instead of confiscat- ing farmers land as a concession. Labourers from the local population should be hired rather than outside migrants in order to funnel economic benefits into nearby communities. China’s opium crop substitution programme has very little to do with providing mechanisms to decrease reliance on poppy cultivation or provide alternative livelihoods for ex-poppy growers. Chinese authorities need to reconsider their regional development strategies of implementation in order to avoid further bor- der conflict and growing antagonism from Burmese society. Financing dispossession is not development.</style>

Initially, it investigates the extent and nature of FDI in agriculture and its sub-sectors, including crops, livestock, food processing, forestry and fisheries. It then analyses the policy and regulatory environment and institutions governing and facilitating such FDI, as well as prevailing business models, in the acquisition of agricultural land. The paper concludes by providing some policy recommendations in response to the challenges facing the sector.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: Foreign investment in agriculture has expanded since 2005, although the figures remain modest. The Cambodian government has prioritized investment in the sector, and an important part of the government strategy has been its policies on land concessions. A 2005 sub-decree sets out the procedures, mechanisms and institutional arrangements for offering economic land concessions (ELCs), with the objective of improving crop diversity, productivity, and employment, among other benefits. By 2009, just over a third of ELCs had gone to foreign investors. Preliminary assessments of these land concessions shed light on a range of positive and negative impacts. There is reason to be concerned over the social, environmental and economic impacts of the investments that have been studied so far. The employment opportunities for local residents are not always plentiful, or attractive, and the large projects can encroach on land that is critical to local livelihoods. This policy brief provides an overview of trends in agricultural investment in Cambodia, discusses the impacts— particularly from investments in agricultural land—and provides some recommendations to policy-makers on how to maximize the benefits of investment in the sector going forward. 1</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Despite the tens of millions of dollars in aid and concessional loans being spent in Cambodia with the ostensible aim of securing land tenure and making the management of land and natural resources more equitable and sustainable, the evidence shows that tenure insecurity, forced evictions and large-scale land grabbing are escalating to alarming levels. Against this backdrop this discussion paper proposes a better approach to development interventions in the land sector, in which processes and tools that elevate rights, transparency and accountability are incorporated throughout the project cycle and broader country strategy. The paper calls on development partners to adopt a ten-pronged framework for a human rights approach to development that aims to shift power to Cambodia’s citizens and increase accountability of decision-makers and power-holders.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">PUBLISHER'S SUMMARY: Domestic and international development strategies often focus on private ownership as a crucial anchor for long-term investment; the security of property rights provides a foundation for capitalist expansion. In recent years, Thailand's policies have been hailed as a prime example of how granting formal land rights to poor farmers in low-income countries can result in economic benefits. But the country provides a puzzle: Thailand faced major security threats from colonial powers in the nineteenth century and from communism in the twentieth century, yet only in the latter case did the government respond with pro-development tactics. In Land and Loyalty, Tomas Larsson argues that institutional underdevelopment may prove, under certain circumstances, a strategic advantage rather than a weakness and that external threats play an important role in shaping the development of property regimes. Security concerns, he finds, often guide economic policy. The domestic legacies, legal and socioeconomic, resulting from state responses to the outside world shape and limit the strategies available to politicians. While Larsson's extensive archival research findings are drawn from Thai sources, he situates the experiences of Thailand in comparative perspective by contrasting them with the trajectory of property rights in Japan, Burma, and the Philippines.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Increased global demand for land underscores the need for well-designed, country-level land policies to protect long-held rights, facilitate land access, and address constraints to growth. However, reforms are often technically complex, politically sensitive, and time consuming. It is thus critical to identify priority issues in a participatory way, have a clear understanding of how they fi t into the broader policy context, and be able to monitor improvements over time. The Land Governance Assessment Framework: Identifying and Monitoring Good Practice in the Land Sector presents a framework (the LGAF) to assess land governance at the country level, based on existing evidence. In doing so, the LGAF points toward areas where further study is needed, identifi es options for regulatory or institutional change, and helps planning for the conduct and evaluation of pilot programs. The LGAF provides policy makers with a quick overview of the quality of land governance in fi ve key areas: • rights recognition and enforcement • land use planning, land management, and taxation • management of public land • public provision of land information • dispute resolution and confl ict management. While its design builds on extensive experience with land sector reform, the LGAF differs from other assessment tools because it is based on the involvement of stakeholders and experts at the local level in an inclusive process that can subsequently be built upon to monitor progress over time. The implementation and use of the LGAF in a growing number of countries also provide ways to identify good practice and share experience for policy reform, thus helping countries to move toward operationalizing international initiatives to improve land governance at the local level. This book describes the structure and rollout of the LGAF tool and includes detailed case studies based on its implementation in fi ve selected countries: Ethiopia, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Peru, and Tanzania. Implementation manual and country reports are available online. The book will be of interest to land specialists and practitioners, policy makers, managers and experts from development institutions, and international and nongovernmental organizations, as well as academics.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Rural areas in Cambodia have been the target of large-scale land acquisitions since the late 1990s. As of March 2012, economic land concessions in Cambodia covered more than 2 million hectares, equivalent to over half of the country’s arable land. In this paper, we discuss the policy narratives and discursive strategies that are employed by various actors to justify and legitimize large-scale land acquisitions. We then analyze the underlying mechanisms of such acquisitions and investments and examine how they are entangled with donor-assisted land use planning efforts. Finally, we explore local people’s strategies of resistance. Our findings suggest that the Cambodian ruling elite has enabled land grabbing through three major mechanisms: first, by establishing a form of ‘shadow governance’ and corrupting the legal culture; second, by discursively justifying expropriation and resettlement through emphasizing rural development, ecological restoration and poverty alleviation; third, by instrumentalizing donor-supported, pro-poor land allocation in the form of social land concessions towards legitimizing land grabbing and distributional injustices and minimizing opposition to land grabs among local communities. Local strategies of resistance have been desperate, sporadic and atomistic vis-à-vis the powerful coalition of government authorities, concessionaires and the military.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In recent years, various actors, from big foreign and domestic corporate business and finance to governments, have initiated a large-scale worldwide enclosure of agricultural lands, mostly in the Global South but also elsewhere. This is done for large-scale industrial and industrial agriculture ventures and often packaged as large-scale investment for rural development. But rather than being investment that is going to benefit the majority of rural people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, this process constitutes a new wave of land and water ‘grabbing’. It is a global phenomenon whereby the access, use and right to land and other closely associated natural resources is being taken over - on a large-scale and/or by large-scale capital – resulting in a cascade of negative impacts on rural livelihoods and ecologies, human rights, and local food security. In this context TNI aims to contribute to strengthening the campaigns by agrarian social movements in order to make them more effective in resisting land and water grabbing; and in developing and advancing alternatives such as land/food/water sovereignty and agro-ecological farming systems.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article seeks to draw connections between a political ecology of global investment in resource sector development and a culturally informed understanding of rural out-migration across the Lao–Thai border. The author highlights how the departures of rural youth for wage labor in Thailand and the remittances they return to sending villages are becoming important for understanding agrarian transformations in Laos today. In the first section the author introduces the contemporary context of cross-border migrations across the Lao–Thai Mekong border. The second section shifts focus to a village in Laos’s central Khammouane Province, where extended field research was conducted between 2006 and 2009. In this village, youth out-migration to Thailand has become a widespread phenomenon, with nearly every household involved. The segmented cultural and gendered features of this migration and its salience for understanding contemporary transformations in this locale invite a broadening of agrarian studies analysis. The final section expands upon how political ecology can provide such a broader analysis by drawing attention to how extractive resource projects affect local tenure rights and livelihoods, with significant rents captured by the state and resource firms. By making these con- nections, the author argues there are coercive underpinnings to contemporary Mekong migrations, which may be linked to governance problems in the Lao resource sector.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Most of the land reforms of recent decades have followed an approach of\n``formalization and capitalization{''} of individual land titles (de\nSoto 2000). However, within the privatization agenda, benefits of\nunimproved land (such as land rents and value capture) are reaped\nprivately by well-organized actors, whereas the costs of valorization\n(e. g., infrastructure) or opportunity costs of land use changes are\nshifted onto poorly organized groups. Consequences of capitalization and\nformalization include rent seeking and land grabbing. In developing\ncountries, formal law often transpires to work in favor of the winners\nof the titling process and is opposed by the customary rights of the\nlosers. This causes a lack of general acknowledgement of formalized law\n(which is made responsible for deprivation of livelihoods of vulnerable\ngroups) and often leads to a clash of formal and customary norms.\nCountries may fall into a state of de facto anarchy and ``de facto open\naccess{''}. Encroachment and destruction of natural resources may\nspread. A reframing of development policy is necessary in order to fight\nthese aberrations. Examples and evidence are provided from Cambodia,\nwhich has many features in common with other countries in Asia and\nSub-Saharan Africa in this respect.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Wars and their aftermaths frequently transform land use and ownership, reshaping 'post-conflict' landscapes through new boundaries, population movements, land reforms and conditions of access. Within a global context of controversial land concessions and farmland acquisitions, we bring to light the continued salience of historical memories of war in the ways land conflicts are being negotiated in Laos. Considering circumstances at different scales-from bilateral government relations to village-level claims-we find that political capital linked to memories of wartime affiliations have crucial spatial and place-based connections, and that they affect the ways investors, government officials and villagers negotiate over land concessions. Ethnographic evidence, spatial analysis and a survey of expatriate development workers engaged with land issues in Laos suggest that such 'political memories' are an important but often overlooked factor in shaping an uneven concessions landscape. We discuss implications for foreign development organizations that tend to privilege technical and legal aspects of land management over such political dimensions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In order to inform Myanmar’s first multi-stakeholder national dialogue workshop on land tenure and user rights (held November 24th &amp; 25th, 2012), Forest Trend’s Senior Law &amp; Policy Advisor Rob Oberndorf was asked to conduct an in-depth analysis of recently enacted land legislation in the country, and suggest ways in which the legal frameworks relating to rural land management could be improved. This report is the result of that research and analysis assignment. This review analyses the current laws and economic situation related to access to land for smallholder farmers in Myanmar. It makes recommendations for improvements to be written into policy and legislation, and institutions and mechanisms to be created, which will ensure smallholder farmers and especially women gain full legal protection of their land tenure rights.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OVERVIEW: The Cambodian Rural Urban Migration Project (CRUMP) is a collaborative effort involving three entities – the RGC, represented by the Ministry of Planning, the UNFPA and an academic institution represented by consultant from the University of California San Francisco. The project involves a group of individuals across these entities interested in the movement of people in and around Cambodia. Given the demographic and economic realities in Cambodia, we began with the assumption that migration in the country is unavoidable and should be embraced. But, we believe that policies should and can take advantage of the circumstances for the benefit of the Cambodian population. Policies require evidence-based information. Therefore, the main aim of the project is to collect survey data that allow examination of characteristics of migrants and investigation into the linkages between migration and welfare of individuals, families and communities.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The Cambodian case examines migration, land tenure and land management, in a context of conflict and the use of force in land transfers since the time of the Khmer Rouge regime to the present, by studying five agro-ecological zones close to the Kamping Pouy irrigation system in Battambang Province. The study combines analysis of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of household use of land and labor with a historical and ethnographic review of conflict and institutional factors in successive land administrations. Continuing in-migration is reflected in population increases in Battambang and other provinces of Northwest Cambodia in conditions of limited land availability and landlordism, and conflict over expropriation of land by armed groups and business interests. Land transfers to a growing wealthy class of businessmen and government officials have contributed to the creation of a subclass of very poor, landless households whose livelihoods depend on agricultural wage labor, locally and in Thailand, and access to the commons. Access to land for a substantial proportion of the community depends on either tenancy, sharecropping or wage labor on the land of wealthier farmers. Three problematic processes that run counter to the Cambodian Constitution and Land Law are systemic: 1) the usurpation of land rights by locally operating armed groups; 2) legitimation of such land acquisition by military-business-government officials by corrupt officeholders and local government officials; and 3) the capture of rents or profits by agencies responsible for safeguarding natural resources.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The purpose of this study is to identify potential agents of change in Myanmar society that can facilitate rapid industrialization and recommend ways the international community can support private sector development by aiding such groups. The historical enquiry in Part I suggests Myanmar‟s lack of success in industrialization is largely due to an inward looking political elite with a predisposition towards State-led development rooted in nationalism stemming from the colonial period. The hybrid economy, which is neither socialist, mixed economy nor market oriented, created by partial economic reform and reversals since 1988 has two implications for the current situation. First, the new president in his promotion of the economic reform agenda is not constrained by policy formulation capacity: economists have had many years to consider ways to re-establish transition to market oriented economy. Second, the very existence of a hybrid economy reveals the presence of powerful interests vested in the status quo. Implementation capacity is the main issue and two prospective scenarios are outlined: de- industrialization should the president fail in his mission and the initiation of rapid industrial development should he succeed. Part II takes cognizance of current dynamics in the world economy as well as noting the development paths of successful economies in the region. Myanmar‟s factor endowment is reviewed in the light of the „resource curse‟ and the economic reform agenda is outlined, with outward orientation and private sector-led development emphasized. Industrial development hinges on the Biz-15 (the country‟s best-connected businessmen with their large family-owned conglomerates) aligning their interests with SMEs: they stand to vastly increase their fortunes by building and operating the modern infrastructure essential for a competitive and dynamic SME-populated manufacturing exports sector, and also by facilitating “anchor” FDI from MNCs. Such fortunes, commensurate with those in the region, would be justified if the Biz-15 can raise the rate of progressive change acceptable to their political patrons so Myanmar‟s 60mn population can all prosper. In Part III, I recommend the international community support a major study by a supply chain manager working with Biz-15 members to explore strategies for the growth and integration of a nascent export processing sector in Myanmar into the China-centric Asian supply chains to rich country markets.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Myanmar faces an unprecedented scale of structural landlessness in rural areas, increasing displacement threats to farmers as a result of growing investment interest by both national and international firms, expanding speculation in land and real estate, and grossly inad- equate housing conditions facing significant sections of both the urban and rural popula- tion. Legal and other protections afforded by the current legal framework, the new Farmland Law and other newly enacted legislation are wholly inadequate. These conditions are further compounded by a range of additional HLP challenges linked both to the various peace nego- tiations and armed insurgencies in the east of the country, in particular Kachin State, and the unrest in Rakhine State in the western region. The Government and people of Myanmar are thus struggling with a series of HLP challenges that require immediate, high-level and creative attention in a rights-based and consistent manner. As the country begins what will be a long and arduous journey toward democratization, the rule of law and stable new institutions, laws and procedures, the time is ripe for the Government to work together with all stakeholders active within the HLP sector to develop a unique Myanmar- centric approach to addressing HLP challenges that shows the country’s true potential. And it is also time for the Government to begin to take comprehensive measures – some quick and short-term, others more gradual and long-term – to equitably and intelligently address the considerable HLP challenges the country faces, and grounding these firmly within the reform process.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper critically examines theories of accumulation, dispossession and exclusion for analyzing the agrarian transformations that result from contemporary large-scale land acquisitions across the Global South. Building upon Marx's primitive accumulation, Harvey's accumulation by dispossession and Hall et al.'s Powers of Exclusion, conceptual lenses are developed through which to examine how land grabs transform property and social relationships of resource-based production. I examine the concession of 10,000 hectares by the central government of Laos to a Vietnamese corporation for extracting timber and planting rubber in the southern province of Attapeu. This acquisition has excluded farmers from land and resources that constituted their primary sources of (re)production, reconfigured rural property relations, altered the peasant relationship to land and produced new exploitative forms of wage labor.</style>

Journal of Peasant Studies, 39(3-4), pp.1017–1037.; Research-bas: The study is based on ten months of fieldwork in Attapeu province from October 2009 to August 2010, as part of the author's PhD study. It involves mainly semistructured interviews with community leaders in seven villages, 10 farmers in each of three of these villlages, government officials and company staff.;ZZZ;AgriculturalModernisation-rel: The main legitimising rationale for the rubber investment is that it brings modernisation in the form of an agro-industrialised model of rural production, use of supposedly under-utilised land, modern forms of labour practice, and revenue to the Lao state. The study shows that all of these legitimising assumptions are ill-founded. The model of rural production is based on transformation of a diverse land and forest production base to a monocropping regime. The land expropriated had previously been vital to farmers' household economy. The labour arrangements are exploitative and impoverishing. And the revenue to the Lao state is paltry.;ZZZ;ZZZ;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Farmers in the affected villages have lost a combination of forest land, grazing land and some individual swiddens and paddy land as a result of the rubber investment. The article qualifies 'dispossession' as a partial process that, unlike hydropower and mining projects, allows villagers to remain on their residential plots. In turn, this sets up particular labour relations between the partially dispossessed villagers - who have also lost significant income-earning opportunities with the loss of access to forest products in the area grabbed - and the company.;ZZZ;ZZZ;FDI-rel: Investment by Hoang Anh Gia Lai takes advantage of a resource (land) that is in short supply in Vietnam and supposedly in greater supply in neighbouring Laos. However, it relies on forcible land acquisition by the state, taking advantage of the legibility afforded by the land and forest allocation program. The FDI arrangements link local investment to favours to the Lao state in the form of HAGL support to a high profile national project, the SEA Games facility in Vientiane. Compensation has been very low, and villagers have had to negotiated on their own without support from local officials.;ZZZ;ZZZ;MigrationLabour-rel: A key insight of this article is that land grabbing is not simply a 'displacing' phenomenon. In this case, the significant process toward full or partial proletarianisation has not been to push farmers to the cities, but rather to put them in the position of a reserve labour pool on which the company can draw. Nevertheless, there are indications that dispossessed farmers will not necessarily choose - or be chosen - to provide the main source of labour for the rubber plantation, which may seek to bring in Vietnamese labour.;Overall-rel: This paper gives a well theorised analysis of changing land and labour relations associated with land grabbing in southern Laos. It takes the case of a large Vietnamese company, Hoang Anh Gia Lai, which has expanded and diversified rapidly since it was founded in 1993 as a wood processing business. While real estate in HCM City built its capital base, investment in neighbouring countries' resource sector is its main business. The paper looks at a 10000 hectare rubber investment by HAGL in Attapeu Province. On the empirical side, the article is particularly interesting at the macro-scale in showing how the Lao state has been cultivated by the company through support for a national showcase project (SEA Games infrastructure) to gain privileges in the form of land concessions, and at the micro-level to show what this has meant for small scale farmers dispossessed of some but not all of their land. The paper is based on three key conceptual planks: primitive accumulation (Marx), accumulation by dispossession (Harvey), exclusion (Hall, Hirsch and Li), and it uses these to show how change in property and social relations result from land grabbing.;ZZZ;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over the past decade the Myanmar government has increasingly promoted industrial agricultural production in the country, especially for rubber. With the lead up to the national elections, and now after political-economic reforms begin to set in, foreign investors are eager to make Myanmar into the next rubber production frontier. This report outlines the emerging political ecology of rubber production in Myanmar, with particular attention to the political economy and geography of rubber development taking root during Myanmar’s reform period.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">INTRODUCTION: What is property? What do rights to property cover and what are their limits? To whom do these rights belong? In an era where everything can become a commodity, be branded, trademarked and copyrighted, disputes over property and property rights uncover tensions at every level of society, between and among different levels of the state and various social configurations, from individuals to neighborhoods and whole villages. Disputes over property are also disputes between competing social goods and values. Projects that improve a country’s infrastructure for the benefit of the many may infringe on the rights of the few to enjoy their property. Attempts to preserve scarce resources may reduce or eliminate altogether hitherto public access to them. Communally held property is no longer recognized under new legal regimes. Community norms clash with national laws; market value fails to align with moral values. In societies that undergo profound change in political regimes such as countries that transitioned into and/or out of socialism, and/or rapid economic growth issues such as these are made visible more often than in societies with more stable political regimes and economic systems. Vietnam, which, within the span of a century, has experienced colonial rule (and prior to that imperial rule), socialism (in the North), a limited free market economy (in the South) and most recently a market-driven economy combined with a one party political system, offers an excellent opportunity for exploring some of these tensions. When Marxist terminology was first introduced into Vietnam, the term proletariat—working class—was translated into “propertyless.” It applied equally to landless peasants, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the population, as to the far smaller number of workers. All that peasants and workers had was their labor; but even this was not entirely their own. It could be indentured to private landowners or conscripted by the state, whether imperial, colonial, or socialist. Today, labor continues to be a Vietnamese peasant’s chief asset, as can be seen in the number of Vietnamese guest workers in Europe, the Middle East and in various countries of East Asia. Some of that labor is coerced and forms part of the phenomenon of human trafficking. At the same time, as in many other countries, practically anything, whether tangible or intangible, can be turned into a marketable commodity. In the process, it becomes detached from its origins, its meaning and its place in its community transformed by forces that are increasingly translocal and even transnational. The following article by Thomas Sikor constitutes the epilogue of a volume of articles edited by Mark Sidel and Hue-Tam Ho Tai arising from a conference on property and property rights in Vietnam held at Harvard University in May 2009. Sikor is particularly concerned with the way power and property are mutually constituted through the operations of the state, society and the market.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In 2012, Vietnam will celebrate 25 years of economic reform and structural re- adjustment from a largely centralized, subsidized economy to one based on market principles. A major component of these reforms has involved establishing land and property rights, thereby giving individuals and organizations secure title to the property they occupy and use. The passing of various Land Laws has given legislative support to the concept of private property rights. This represents a significant ideological change, given that land in Vietnam has always been considered to belong to the State. In conjunction with these changes, focus has shifted to reforming the real property tax from a tax largely based on rice productivity to one based on ad valorem principles. This paper reviews existing property-based taxes, highlighting their weaknesses and outlining the potential for a land tax to effectively replace the current property tax.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The key findings of this field visit identified two main types of agricultural investments in northern Laos. One is the government-initiated agricultural cooperation program, in par-ticular the Alternative Development Scheme aka Opium Substation Development Scheme supported by Chinese government. The other is individual small-scale contract farming investments by Chinese businessmen. Current and potential issues related to these agricultural investments were also examined, including border passings and cus-tom clearance procedures. It was found that different types of investments have different procedures to allow their harvested products to pass the border into China. With Laos still being underdeveloped, its government has limited financial support to ad-dress issues like lacking of irrigation systems, drought and flood control measures, roads and electricity supply. Agricultural management and technicians are in great needs. Good seeds, fertilizer, and pesticide and other agricultural supplements are also needed. The issues raised in the report require a comprehensive and consistent support from concerned government agencies, participating companies and communities, not only from within, but also from outside at regional and international level. When it comes to cross-border issues in particularly, it calls for more meticulous consideration on how to promote economic development and social and environmental progress.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The report, submitted in accordance with resolution 18/25 of 26 September 2011 of the Human Rights Council, is an assessment of the human rights impact of economic land concessions (ELCs) and other land concessions and major development projects in Cambodia (generally referred to as ―land concessions‖ throughout the report unless otherwise specified). It includes not only an analysis of concessions pertaining to agro- industry (for example, rubber, sugar, acacia and cassava plantations), but also to concessions for mining, oil and gas, forestry, and concessions for the purposes of tourism, property development, and large scale infrastructure, such as hydropower dams. The report analyses information that I have received from the beginning of my mandate in 2009 through the end of July 2012, including the domestic legal framework governing land rights (and law and policies related to protected areas), international developments related to Cambodia‘s human rights obligations involving land, and the impacts of economic and other land concessions on the enjoyment of human rights. The cases selected reflect these submissions. The report is based on official government data and information, analysis, individual petitions and testimonial evidence submitted by individuals, communities and local and international non-governmental organizations. The report also benefits from research done by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Cambodia, which is carrying out ongoing monitoring and advocacy related to this issue. While all my activities are carried out with the cooperation of the Government, it should be noted that the official documentation needed for a complete analysis in some areas was not forthcoming, and thus gaps in information exist in some places.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Vietnam's rapid and sustained economic growth and poverty reduction in the last two decades benefitted from the policy and legal reforms embodied in the Land Laws of 1987, 1993 and 2003 and subsequent related legal acts. This note outlines reforms related to four main themes. The first relates to the needed reform for agriculture land use to create opportunity to enhance effectiveness of land use as well as to secure farmers' rights in land use. Prolonging the duration of agricultural land tenure would give land users greater incentives to invest and care for the land. Raising the land holding ceiling and allowing greater land accumulation would facilitate greater economies of scale, and extending the rights of agricultural land users to alter the land use purpose will further improve efficiency. This scope for more flexible land use will become increasingly important in the context of climate change, with farmers needing to make a range of adjustments based upon expected weather patterns and the associated risks. The second set of priority reforms is to create transparent and equitable land acquisition and compensation by the State. Limiting the use of compulsory land acquisition only to cases for the public's benefit would similarly give land users more fairness and more confidence in their rights related to land. By relying predominantly on voluntary land conversions, there would also be a stronger sense of equity in those cases when land users actually do lose their land. Changing the focus of land compensation pricing (in cases of compulsory land acquisition), and introducing innovations such as benefit sharing, land pooling and land readjustment are also essential for generating a sense of fairness. Creating an efficient grievance redress mechanism at the investment project level would reduce complaints, speed up project implementation and facilitate social stability. A third set of priority reforms is that the land law should offer the opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen the land use rights of vulnerable groups, such as women, the poor and ethnic minority communities. Land management oversight can be made more efficient by amending the land management decentralization and building monitoring and evaluation systems. Expanding the coverage of Land Use Rights Certificates (LURCs) and ensuring the rights and benefits of the land users would further help improve efficiency and fairness. Finally, the fourth set of priority reforms is aimed at making the governance system more effective and accountable. Developing a more flexible and effective land planning management system, and improving transparency of land and anti-corruption in land management are all needed to take Vietnam's land governance system closer to that worthy of a middle income country.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In the two decades since the 1992 Rio Conference, Land-Use Planning (LUP) has become recognized as a key instrument in putting discourses on sustainable development into practice. In Lao PDR, despite the implementation problems, it is still seen as a lever for securing land tenure, rationalizing extension services provision, and more recently, for implementing ‘Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation’ (REDD) schemes. Impact assessments of past LUP have revealed weaknesses of local institutions in the effective implementation of land policies. In order to avoid the blind trust placed in delusive LUP success stories, methods for monitoring community participation and understanding of LUP activities have been developed in order to assess the quality of the process. Expanding on this perspective, this article proposes a method to assess the quality of LUP outputs and to visualize the gap between planning objectives and their actual achievements. This method, based on a refined analysis of past and present land zoning practices in Lao PDR, gives full prominence to the complexity of landscape mosaics and the way local populations actually use the land. Furthermore, this approach, developed and tested under real planning conditions, can also be seen as a safeguard and support for inexperienced implementers in their land-use planning practices, as a diagnostic instrument for quality assessment, i.e. level of accuracy of a land-use plan, and may finally pave the way towards becoming a tool for land-use planning certification.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since the emergence of the sustainable development paradigm in the late 1980s, land-use planning has become a key arena for political debates over society-environment interactions and, in practice, an important means for territorialisation projects. The paper reviews the main planning approaches that have been employed over the past three decades in the Lao Peo- ple’s Democratic Republic, a country that has long been viewed as a valuable policy testing ground for the proponents of sustainable development. It highlights three concurrent territorialisation projects that have shaped the history of land-use planning and have fuelled tensions between central and subnational governments and local actors, national and foreign institutions, and land suitability and sustainability approaches. The paper argues that the latter tensions reflect an important dynamism and reactivity in the planning arena. It concludes that the capacity of land-use planners to adapt to specific contexts and evolving socio-environmental challenges should be harnessed in order to reconcile conflicting approaches to planning and, perhaps, to achieve sustainable development.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The relationship between the rule of law and equity is now a recurring theme in contemporary development discourse both internationally (World Bank 2005a) and in Cambodia (World Bank 2007). The reasons for focusing on law in discussions of equity in Cambodia are not difficult to understand. The country aspires to be a liberal democracy, and law features prominently in the way liberal democracies promise to deliver on equity.1 In such systems, a free public sphere ensures that debate and discussion can take place with equal participation from all citizens (Gabardi 2001, 551). Democratic accountability should ensure that the law is a legitimate expression of the public interest. As Kant put it most succinctly, in a just society “legislative power can only belong to the united will of the people” (Axtmann 1996, 18). Further, liberal ideals associated with the judiciary (independence, guarantees of procedural fairness, judicial review of executive acts, equality before the law, access to justice, and so forth) mean – again, theoretically – that the institutions responsible for the execution and enforcement of the law will work to promote equity in practice (O’Donnell 2004). The fact that both state and market actors are embedded in this sort of regulatory and institutional framework makes liberal democracy one possible model for an equitable society. This is a model that is associated with prosperity, and as such there are good reasons why developing countries might want to work toward it. Cambodia’s constitution is unequivocal in its commitment to liberal democracy, and since 1992, the assumption underlying the provision of more than $5 billion in international development assistance has been that the country requires support to make this transition (Chanboreth and Hach 2008). Unfortunately, the question of how to sup- port a country like Cambodia to develop institutions that function in a way that reasonably approximates the general models described in previous chapters is inherently difficult to answer.</style>

In, Tamanaha, B., Sage. C., Woolcok, M.J., (eds), Legal Pluralism and Development: Scholars and Practitioners in Dialogue, Cambridge University Press, pp. 83-92.; Overall-rel: A key message communicated in this book chapter is that investigations of the role of law must at times also include an examination of power and authority in particular contexts. The authors introduce legal pluralism as a useful lens for understanding how land regulation works in Cambodia, and why donor efforts to transform land governance through ‘good’ land laws have largely failed. The historical overlaying of legal systems has resulted in a complex plural legal field where the State is not the only source of authority and legitimacy. State formal law (such as the Cambodian 2001 Land Law) co-exists and competes with other legal norms and practices, such as “land to the tiller” policies, which date back to pre-colonial times. Without overarching institutions with sufficient authority and legitimacy to resolve land conflicts, actors are left to leverage whatever political and legal recourse they have at hand to legitimise their claims. Inevitably, those with power and money are able to mobilise more resources that legitimise their claims, thus securing land rights at the expense of more vulnerable groups.; Research-bas: This is a chapter in a book that explores the implications of legal pluralism for legal development. The argument set out in the chapter draws on the authors’ earlier work under the World Bank’s Justice for the Poor program, which has a country program in Cambodia since mid-2005. The program is aimed at informing, designing and supporting pro-poor approaches to justice reform.; AccessToJustice-rel: In the absence of formal institutions that can arbitrate land disputes in a manner that is perceived to be fair, the poor resort to a variety of advocacy strategies to gain leverage in their negotiations with more powerful parties. Strategies of the poor include collective action, use of media, and appeals to local government, human rights NGOs and national institutions for intervention. Formal national laws are drawn on but mainly in the mode of legal argumentation, rather than with an expectation of their strict application by the State. While there is potential for these strategies to work in favour of the poor in a few cases, the results are highly contingent and entail high risks.; CivilSociety-Donors-rel: The authors caution against simplistic depictions of the relationship between law and development, whereby law is often seen instrumentally as a progressive force for social and political change. Rather than simply reflecting policies and laws, institutions are embedded in wider economic, political and social contexts and power relations. Donor programs and other interventions aimed at increasing equity and other aspects of land governance through good law will remain a challenge unless institutions also become embedded in these relations. Ongoing problems with the implementation of law are likely to be due to competing norms and sources of authority and power, rather than issues of a technical nature or because farmers are not aware of formal law.; Policy-law-rel: The concept of legal pluralism wards against a simplistic view of law that focuses on the State formal law as the principal or only legitimate legal system. In Cambodia, where formal laws compete with several other norms and practices, law often serves as a basis for negotiation of outcomes rather than for implementation. In increasingly polarised societies where powerful elites can mobilise patronage networks to security land rights, this often leads to unequal outcomes.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The Land Matrix project was set up to respond to the lack of widely available, reliable data on large-scale land transactions in the Global South. It collates and evaluates data from a wide range of sources on large transnational transactions in the agricultural sector and other sectors. This report represents the first thorough analysis of the Land Matrix database. The Land Matrix figures confirm that there is a worldwide rush for land, and while the rate of land acquisition in developing countries appears to have lost some of its initial pace, the Land Matrix data does not support the argument that this rush is only a speculation-driven bubble, unlikely to materialize in real projects. A large number of land acquisitions have been followed by project implementation.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Viewed from the lens of ?land grabs?, Vietnam's fast-growing tree plantations look like an anomaly; many of them are tiny, owned and operated by rural households. In contrast, private companies and transnational corporations have not been able to get much of a foot into Vietnam's plantation sector. This paper identifies the practices and processes underlying the apparent anomaly. On the basis of fieldwork in four villages, it points to the concrete mechanisms by which households have gained access to land, finance, and wood markets. Government policy emerges as a critical factor enabling household access, not in the sense of a coherent policy package but understood as sedimented outcomes of everyday processes of state formation over the past three decades. A central element in contestations over the state is what I call ?politics of possession?: possession, referring to entitlement and control, has been closely tied to ideas about the state. The paper uses these empirical observations to contribute towards theoretical understandings of land grabs and exclusion. Land grabs may have to say as much about dynamics of state formation as processes of commodification and market expansion.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Large-scale international investments in developing country agriculture, especially acquisitions of agricultural land, continue to raise international concern. Certainly, complex and controversial issues – economic, political, institutional, legal and ethical – are raised in relation to food security, poverty reduction, rural development, technology and access to land and water resources. Yet at the same time, some developing countries are making strenuous efforts to attract foreign investment into their agricultural sectors. They see an important role for such investments in filling the gap left by dwindling official development assistance and the limitations of their own domestic budgetary resources, creating employment and incomes and promoting technology transfer. More investment is certainly needed – more than US$80 billion per year according to FAO analysis. But can foreign direct investment be compatible with the needs of local stakeholders as well as those of the international investor? And can these investments yield more general development benefits? Analyzing the impacts of foreign direct investment in developing country agriculture and even understanding its extent and nature has been hampered by the weakness of the available information and the lack of comprehensive statistical data. Much discussion of the phenomenon has been based on media stories but these are potentially misleading unless very carefully triangulated. This lack of reliable detailed information means serious analysis has tended to rely on case studies. This book collects together case studies undertaken by FAO in nine different countries. These add to the increasing volume of evidence from similar case studies undertaken by other international organizations. It is important that any international investment should bring development benefits to the receiving country in terms of technology transfer, employment creation, upstream and downstream linkages and so on if these investments are to be “win-win” rather than “neo-colonialism”. These beneficial flows are not automatic: care must be taken in the formulation of investment contracts and selection of business model. Appropriate legislative and policy frameworks need to be in place. The case studies in this book describe the extent, nature and impacts of international investments and examine the effectiveness of policy and legal frameworks. Obviously, generalizations are difficult both on the impacts of foreign investments and on the best regulatory approaches but the studies provide a wealth of insights which should be valuable to host country governments and investors alike. Their findings shed light on a number of issues including the extent to which forms of investment other than land acquisition – such as contract farming, out-grower schemes and other joint ventures - are more likely to yield development benefits to host countries. They highlight the importance of stronger governance in the host country and provide some indications of the priority areas of focus for international efforts to formulate guiding principles for responsible agricultural investments.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OBJECTIVES SECTION: These Voluntary Guidelines seek to improve governance of tenure of land*, fisheries and forests. They seek to do so for the benefit of all, with an emphasis on vulnerable and marginalized people, with the goals of food security and progressive realization of the right to adequate food, poverty eradication, sustainable livelihoods, social stability, housing security, rural development, environmental protection and sustainable social and economic development. All programmes, policies and technical assistance to improve governance of tenure through the implementation of these Guidelines should be consistent with States’ existing obligations under international law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. These Guidelines seek to: 1. improve tenure governance by providing guidance and information on internationally accepted practices for systems that deal with the rights to use, manage and control land, fisheries and forests. 2. contribute to the improvement and development of the policy, legal and organizational frameworks regulating the range of tenure rights that exist over these resources. 3. enhance the transparency and improve the functioning of tenure systems. 4. strengthen the capacities and operations of implementing agencies; judicial authorities; local governments; organizations of farmers and small-scale producers, of fishers, and of forest users; pastoralists; indigenous peoples and other communities; civil society; private sector; academia; and all persons concerned with tenure governance as well as to promote the cooperation between the actors mentioned.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article examines the transition from shifting cultivation to rubber production for a study area in northern Laos PDR using an agent-based model of land-cover change. A primary objective of the model was to assess changes in household-level inequality with the transition from shifting cultivation to rubber adoption. A secondary objective was to develop explanations for the rate of rubber adoption in the study area. We fit the model to historical land-cover data and land use histories developed from household-level field interviews to reproduce the land use decisions of smallholders over time. The model results indicate an increase in household inequality over time as a function of the variable rate of rubber adoption over time.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Abstract: The agricultural Sector in Cambodia still contributes the dominant quan- tity to the GDP. It is the most important source of income and rural livelihood for around 80% of the Cambodian population. Cambodia’s rural population faces new challenges like high population growth, embracing market economy and international private investment, nationwide food security and decreasing ag- ricultural production conditions as a result of rapidly changing socio-economic conditions since 1990. Major agronomic innovations are the introduction of im- proved new varieties as well as rice intensifications systems like the SRI production system. With more than 2.3 million ha of rice production, there is no significant diversification in the agrarian sector. Only some vegetable, cash crop and fruit production have emerged to an increasingly important, farming system. Predomi- nant agrarian strategies for small farmers as well as economic investors are the exploitation and even over-exploitation of natural resources with little investment into a more sustainable production.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">An exclusive focus on external forces risks the production of an overgeneralized account of a ubiquitous neoliberalism, which insufficiently accounts for the profusion of local variations that currently comprise the neoliberal project as a series of articulations with existing political economic circumstances. Although the international financial institutions initially promoted neoliberal economics in the global South, powerful elites were happy to oblige. Neoliberalism frequently reveals opportunities for well-connected officials to informally control market and material rewards, allowing them to line their own pockets. It is in this sense of the local appropriation of neoliberal ideas that scholars must go beyond conceiving of ‘neoliberalism in general’ as a singular and fully realized policy regime, ideological form, or regulatory framework, and work towards conceiving a plurality of ‘actually existing neoliberalisms’ with particular characteristics arising from mutable geohistorical outcomes embedded within national, regional, and local process of market-driven sociospatial transformation. What constitutes ‘actually existing’ neoliberalism in Cambodia as distinctly Cambodian is the ways in which the patronage system has allowed local elites to co-opt, transform, and (re)articulate neoliberal reforms through a framework which asset strips public resources, thereby increasing people’s exposure to corruption, coercion, and violence. It is to such an ‘articulation agenda’ that I attend to here as, in seeking to provide a more nuanced reading to recent work on neoliberalism in Cambodia by outlining some of its salient characteristics, a more empirical basis to theorizations of ‘articulated neoliberalism’ is revealed.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Today, over 80 percent of the population of Cambodia lives in rural areas and about 73 percent depends on agriculture for their livelihoods. However, only about 20 percent of the land is arable. Cambodia became a member of FAO in 1950, and an FAO Representative office was opened in 1995. Since 1979, FAO Cambodia has invested a total budget of US$217 326 859 000 through 205 different projects in areas of agricultural productivity, irrigation, livestock production and health, fisheries, food security, consumer protection and food safety, promotion of access to new markets, forestry and the environment, and small-scale craft agro-industry. As a knowledge institution, FAO’s main achievements to the national development process are best expressed through its support to capacity building and the provision of qualified science-based technical advice.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The focus in the 2011 Cambodia Human Development Report is on climate change and rural live-lihoods. While this captures only part of the picture of climate change in Cambodia, it is an essential starting point. Even though Cambodia is changing rapidly and the distinctions between rural and urban are becoming less clear, most people continue to depend on a rural economy and natural resources. Although numerous transformations have occurred in this area in recent years, the rural economy remains the cornerstone of national development. The report aims to contribute to more informed public debate in Cambodia by discussing what will be required to build climate-resilient rural livelihoods in the country that will contribute to meeting long-term development objectives.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This paper focuses on the role of the rice sector in Cambodian agriculture strategy. The paper first reviews the performance of the rice sector in Cambodian agriculture and rice-related government policies and interventions, and it then identifies potential and constraints for future development of the rice sector. Against the background of a broad agricultural strategy, the paper further explores the options and possible development path for rice in the future by comparing the current situation in Cambodia with its two neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam, in their early development stage. Although both Thailand and Vietnam are rice growing and exporting countries, they have quite different rice development strategies. The paper concludes with a set of further research topics in which we emphasize Cambodia’s comparative advantage, and propose a comparison study of different development paths in rice development and agricultural diversification. Such comparisons may provide more options to inform Cambodia’s agricultural development strategy in the future.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In its Land Administration, Management and Distribution Program, the Royal Government of Cambodia proclaimed measures to strengthen the Cambodian land markets and tenure security. However, in the past, the country’s land markets suffered severe aberrations caused by price hikes. This affected both urban and rural areas, mainly due to a rollout of urban capital. In particular, these aberrations included the purchase of land purely for speculative reasons, unused and underused plots, which effectively caused a land shortage, as well as the careless sale of land by smallholders on the one hand and land-grabbing on the other. The consequence of this has been an increase in involuntary landlessness, land-poorness, and a rising land concentration. At present, there is still some breathing space — land prices are no longer rising, or are even falling. The price level of land has slipped back to the level of 2007. However, land prices are expected to rise again from 2011 onwards. As in the past, price bubbles in rural areas are mainly expected to arise at locations with a moderate price level, good-quality land, and development expectations, particularly regarding tourism. Experts largely expect future prices to rise in the regions of Krong Preah Sihanouk/Kampot, Battambang/Siem Reap, Kampong Cham/Kratie, and Ratanankiri. Although decelerating forces are also at work now, aberrations on the land market will continue to be possible in the future.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since ceasefire agreements were signed between the Burmese military government and ethnic political groups in the Burma–China borderlands in the early 1990s, violent waves of counterinsurgency development have replaced warfare to target politically-suspect, resource-rich, ethnic populated borderlands. The Burmese regime allocates land concessions in ceasefire zones as an explicit postwar military strategy to govern land and populations to produce regulated, legible, militarized territory. Tracing the relationship of military–state formation, land control andsecuritization, and primitive accumulation in the Burma–China borderlands uncovers the forces of what I am calling ‘ceasefire capitalism’. This study examines these processes of Burmese military–state building over the past decade in resource-rich ethnic ceasefire zones along the Yunnan, China border. I will illustrate this contemporary and violent military–state formation process with two case studies focusing on northern Burma: logging and redirected timber trade flows, and Chinese rubber plantations as part of China's opium substitution program.</style>

Ceasefire Capitalism: military-private partnerships, resource concessions and military-state building in the Burma-China borderlands. Journal of Peasant Studies, 38, 747-770; Overall-rel: The article examines how the cessation of hostilities between the Burmese military and the country’s several ethnic-based insurgencies coupled with the country’s opening up to foreign investment, has led to a surge in large scale agricultural concessions (particularly rubber) in Burma’s northernmost states bordering China. In the new ceasefire zones, the Burmese regime has forged new political and economic allegiances that include Chinese and Burmese business people and political leaders of former ethnic insurgency groups, all of whom are now implicated in land grabbing in the new concession economy. The author coins the term “ceasefire capitalism” to describe the Burmese central State’s co-optation of former political foes by enfolding them into new (trans)national capitalist networks centred on land deals and resource extraction. Ceasefire capitalism, he argues, is a counterinsurgency development strategy deliberately employed by the Burmese military-state to control ethnic people and territories in a post war context.; Research-bas: The article is based data collected over several years by the author working collaboratively with local researchers and national and international organisations.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: Allocating land and resource concessions to private investors as part of the Burmese regime’s broader strategy to territorialize ceasefire spaces has led to the dispossession of mainly ethnic groups from their lands in northern Burma.; FDI-rel: Attracting domestic and foreign investment in agriculture by granting large scale land concessions was a key strategy of the Burmese military-state to gain territorial control in the country’s ethnic peripheries. Large landholdings have been acquired by private companies allegedly to grow rubber and other cash crops for export, although much of the land granted to concessions has remained unplanted. Most concessions in northern Burma are joint ventures between domestic and foreign (mainly Chinese) companies. Domestic companies have often acted as covers for Chinese investors so as to avoid high taxes for 100 per cent foreign-owned concessions. The Chinese state has also subsidised Chinese businesses to invest in rubber and other cash crops through the opium substitution program on the China-Myanmar borderlands.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Ceasefire agreements signed between Burmese military and ethnic-based insurgents offered new opportunities for business deals that allowed the central military-state to gain greater territorial control in the ethnic border uplands. The land concessions granted by the military-state to private parties after ceasefire arrangements has mostly been upland swidden land previously held by ethnic communities under customary arrangements. National land laws that fail to recognise customary land tenure arrangements have facilitated the dispossession of ethnic minorities from their land. Furthermore, the rubber plantations established on large scale concessions in the north of the country have not led to employment opportunities for those who have been dispossessed.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Common-pool resource management is a critical element in the interlocked challenges of food security, nutrition, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. This paper examines strategic policy choices and governance challenges facing Cambodia’s forests and fisheries, the most economically important subsectors of agriculture that rely on common-pool resources. It then outlines policy priorities for institutional development to achieve improvements in implementing these goals. The core argument is that (1) policy support for community-based management in forestry and fisheries requires explicit prioritization to protect against threats from other types of private- and public-sector investment; and (2) the success of these initiatives depends on more systemic governance reforms that address issues of stakeholder representation, mechanisms of accountability, and institutional capacity.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This publication is the product of a multi-year cluster analytical and advisory work on social and land conflict management of the World Bank office in Hanoi, which aimed to assist Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) to improve the land acquisition and conversion process to achieve more sustainable development during the current rapid urbanization and industrialization process. There are three reports explained in this study as: 1) the policy note on improving land acquisition and voluntary land conversion in Vietnam; the study on land valuation mechanisms for compensation, support and resettlement in Vietnam; and the study on improving the system for resolving complaints on compensation, support and resettlement in Vietnam. The objective of the study was to assess the issues relating to involuntary and voluntary land conversion in the current laws and policies, and the implementation of these laws, and to propose improvements to be considered in the preparation of the law on amendments and supplementations of the Land Law scheduled to be placed before the National Assembly in 2013.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In Vietnam, land is acquired from land-use-right certificate holders and allocated to developers of real estate projects by the State, based on a government imposed land-price framework that does not adhere to market principles. Once developed, land is transacted between developers and buyers based on the prevailing market price. This separate price system on land is intended to encourage capital from investors to flow and stimulate economic development. In reality, this policy has led to prolonged conflicts over land acquisition. The conflicts in turn have led to insufficient supply of land for developing residential projects in Ho Chi Minh City. Despite the unbalanced demand and supply of land, the land and housing market in Ho Chi Minh City is in a 'thriving condition'. The study finds that the thriving condition is due to fierce speculation on already available land lots and partially or fully completed housing units in the market. Employing a market survey of 494 residential projects, this study examined the underlying causes of that 'thriving condition'. It seems that the Government is trapped by a peculiar two-price system that favours the developers over the public in general. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

The report suggests that this is the result of weak law enforcement and poor governance in Laos. A number of recommendations are made to address this situation, including improved cooperation between the two countries. The findings are based on undercover operations conducted in 2010 and 2011.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM INTRODUCTION: In April 2008, the Vietnamese corporation Hoàng Anh Gia Lai Joint (HAGL) signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Laos (GoL) agreeing to finance the construction of a $19 million athletes’ village. HAGL financed this property complex in support of the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, a biennial regional sporting event that the GoL was hosting for the first time from December 9th to 18th, 2009, in the capital of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Vientiane. The aid provided by HAGL was divided into two parts: a $4 million cash grant and a $15 million interest-free loan. In return, the company was given the rights to explore for mineral potentials in Sekong and Attapeu provinces of southeastern Laos, log timber from and plant rubber on a 10,000-hectare (ha) plot of land in Attapeu, construct two rubber processing factories in Attapeu, and develop a real estate complex in Vientiane. The $15 million loan would be repaid in part via rental fees on the 10,000 ha. This case of land acquisition is representative of a broader trend of land grabbing that has increasingly occurred in Laos and across the Global South over the last few years. A number of recently emerging reports from development agencies and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) have shown that investors from around the world have been purchasing and leasing massive amounts of land in developing countries. This process has occurred at the same time in Laos, but mostly in the form of land concessions whereby Lao law prevents foreign investors from purchasing land in the country, but land concessions allow them to lease land for a period of between 35 and 75 years, often with the possibility of renewing their contracts. Land concessions have become increasingly common throughout the country over the last half-decade, particularly for extracting land-based resources such as through mining, hydropower, and tree plantations. While the largest investors come from the neighboring countries – China, Thailand, and Vietnam – South Korea, Japan, India, and Australia are not far behind. As reports of the environmental and social consequences of land concessions have emerged it has led the GoL to enact an ambiguous policy of placing and then removing a moratorium on all concessions over 100 ha. Regardless, land concessions have remained the dominant mode of investment in land and the defining feature of the country’s resource-led development path. Development reports at the global level have posed their research question as the following: is this vast increase of investment in farmland generally a negative or positive change for the livelihoods of peasants throughout the developing world? In other words, are we witnessing a giant land grab or a development opportunity? This paper addresses this question from a different angle. Instead, the research question is not whether transnational land acquisitions are inherently ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but instead how they are restructuring agrarian social relations of production and consequently what impacts such transformations might entail for rural livelihoods. Posing the question of land acquisitions as either positive, negative, or something in between is overly vague and fails address the central issue. Understanding how the social relations of production in rural areas are changing can help engender a much more comprehensive understanding of the consequences that such restructuring may hold for peasant livelihoods. In order to paint a fuller picture of the impacts that transnational land acquisitions are having upon agrarian regions, it is critical to understand who is impacted and how.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE FORWARD: Forced evictions frequently lead to the breakdown of community networks and informal support systems relied upon by women in their daily lives. they often mean disruption of children’s education, diminished access to health services and a deterioration of the family’s mental and physical well-being. because many victims of forced eviction are resettled in areas far from urban centres and work opportunities, husbands spend long stretches of time away from their families, leaving their wives to cope alone with daily household chores and family needs. nonetheless these women have developed coping strategies for themselves and as the primary caregivers for their family. the women whose stories are told here have faced forced eviction, or continue to resist eviction and removal from their land, with a mix of fear and bravery, anger and calm resolve. this publication tells the stories of four cambodian women, mai, sophal, heap and vanny, who have faced or resist forced eviction from their homes and land. it also tells the story of hong, a woman from an indigenous community, who is at risk of losing the forests that her people have traditionally depended upon for their survival.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Economic and legal reforms have triggered waves of conflict over property rights and access to urban land in Vietnam. In this article I develop four epistemic case studies to explore the main precepts and practices that courts must negotiate to extend their authority over land disputes. Courts face a dilemma: Do they apply state laws that disregard community regulatory practices and risk losing social relevance, or apply community notions of sit- uational justice that undermine rule formalism? I conclude that reforms de- signed to increase rule formalism in the courts may have the unintended consequence of reducing the capacity for judges to find lasting solutions to land disputes.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article discusses two important concepts of food security and food sovereignty in the context of Vietnam’s post-reform economy. It examines Vietnam’s persistent choice of the food security framework, its resulting policies and their implications. The article argues that the choice of food security framework has served to justify the promotion of industrial agriculture and international trade. While this model has led to increased food productivity, it failed to guarantee access to and quality of food, the other two important pillars of the food security framework. More important, the article argues that the continued adoption of food security and industrial agriculture is not neutral but reflects the shifting position of the Vietnamese government away from the peasantry for the benefits of capital accumulation by other classes.</style>

Rights to determine how to use the land are regularly ignored. However, user rights are often limited. Relying on a unique Vietnamese panel data set at both household and plot levels, we show that crop choice restrictions are widespread and prevent crop diversification. Restrictions do not decrease household income, but restricted households work harder, and there are indications that they are supplied with higher quality inputs. Our findings are consistent with the view that it is possible to intervene effectively in agricultural production to promote output and food security. Nevertheless, potential benefits of a more diversified crop pattern must be carefully considered in a period where global food markets are in turmoil. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land reform, land politics and resettlement in Laos have changed people’s land access and livelihoods. But these reforms have also transformed political subjectivity and landed property into matters for government to a degree hitherto unknown in Laos. The control over people, land and space has consolidated sovereignty in ways that make government an ineluctable part of people’s relation to land. This transforms agrarian relations. Three cases demonstrate how rural small holders’ access to land depends on the ways in which property and political subjects have been produced. As a consequence, a government institution’s control over land does not represent or reflect pre-existing sovereignty. It produces it.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">It has proved much easier to observe the stark divide between the ‘professional optimists’ in the development industry and the ‘professional pessimists’ in academic development studies than it has to disrupt these roles or to explain them in ways that prevent them remaining entrenched. This paper will present and discuss the “Geographies of Evasion” hypothesis which claims to explain how and why rights-based development interventions in particular fail. The key question addressed by the paper is whether the ‘Geographies of Evasion hypothesis’ provides a worthwhile theoretical contribution to overcoming this practitioner-academic impasse. The Geography of Evasion concept was first coined in a study of property rights interventions in Cambodia (Biddulph, 2010) and first articulated as a hypothesis as follows: If the development industry attempts to extend rights which host nation governments are not prepared to enforce, the result will not be a rejection of the industry’s programmes. Rather they will be welcomed, but channelled to places where those rights do not make a difference. This ‘geography of evasion’ will be concealed by policy facades which measure success according to outputs and do not acknowledge the process of spatial marginalisation” (Biddulph, 2011 forthcoming) This paper will present early results of the application of the ‘Geography of Evasion’ hypothesis to the case of REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). It first analyses the global climate negotiation and the implementation discourse parallel to the negotiations, and explains how this discourse invites geographies of evasion. It then presents fieldwork from a REDD pilot activity Cambodia where existing community forestry initiatives are being linked to the voluntary carbon market as a means to pilot REDD. The case of the REDD pilot northwest Cambodia provides early evidence of how deforestation is being prevented in places where the major drivers are least present suggesting that Geographies of Evasion might indeed have predictive power in explaining how REDD might fail. However, more evidence than this is required to make a convincing case for REDD as an evasive/evaded intervention internationally. Geographies of Evasion will gain more purchase in development theory-practice dialogues if it is tested in other contexts than that of rural Cambodia. However, by presenting clear, simple questions to relatively accessible data it promises to be of readier practical import than many currently prominent theorizations of development practice.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: In accordance to the land confiscation documented in this report, the Burmese military regime has not only constantly violated the domestic laws in Burma like the Nationalisation Act, the Land Acquisition Act and also Customary Law but also international law, such as the UDHR charter, CEDAW, CRC, ICESCR and farming protection rights. Thereon, farmers have illegally had their farming lands confiscated some have received minimal and insufficient compensation and other victims have had their lands confiscated without any compensation whatsoever; this report represents those listed above. Moreover, the farmers and local people have had their farming lands confiscated without any practical alternatives or solutions from the military or Government. This is reflected in the current food crisis as well as the devastating affects of underdeveloped living standards existing throughout the country. In the report's research, six fieldworkers met and interviewed 51 farmers and local people who were victims of land confiscation. Through these interviews they collected and compiled their research to reflect the impact of land confiscation in the Ta'ang area and to give a platform to the victims to express their and their families' loss and suffereing as a result of their land being taken. The people interviewed represent only a portion of those who have been victims of land confiscation in the Ta'ang areas throughout Burma. This report endeavors to highlight the continuing human rights violations suffered by the Ta'ang people as a direct result of land confiscation.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">According to the existing studies on Myanmar's economic history, agricultural land in the Lower Myanmar delta was transferred from 'agriculturists' to 'non-agriculturists' under British colonial rule. However, a clear distinction could not be drawn between the agriculturists and non-agriculturists as was generally thought with respect to their economic activity. More importantly, the categories could be applied interchangeably. The purpose of this study is to reconsider the very concept of'agriculturist' as a colonial category in British Burma by exploring the hitherto unused register of holdings (Register I A, U pain hmatpoun sayin).</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Since 2010, the granting of economic land concessions (ELCs) in the areas in which Welthungerhilfe runs projects has led to the demarcation, and in some cases the clearing, of indigenous peoples’ farmland and forest. Land and forest are the most valuable resources of the otherwise resource-poor indigenous people in Ratanakiri. Despite this, the early impacts of ELCs on the livelihood of indigenous people as well as the general conditions under which these are granted remain to be assessed.This study therefore aims to (1) analyse the early impacts of ELCs on indigenous people in the project area of Welthungerhilfe, (2) analyse the context and the procedure of how ELCs are granted in practice, and (3) evaluate possible entry points of intervention.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The main objectives of this study are to produce an overview of existing information related to land issues and governance of indigenous communities and to assess the impact of economic land concessions on the livelihoods of indigenous communities in the northeast of Cambodia. The study generated the following research questions in order to respond to these objectives: 1. What is happening in terms of land acquisition and land governance practices? 2. What are the consequences for indigenous peoples, in terms of livelihoods as well as agricultural systems and socio-cultural practices? 3. How do land governance regulation and its implementation in practice affect the position of indigenous peoples and what may be done to best support them in attaining equitable and sustainable development? The report is in four main parts. This introduction provides the overall research rationale and objectives. Section 2 presents the research methodology, explaining secondary data reviews and the empirical study designed to collect primary information. The fieldwork entailed a household survey, in-depth interviews and focus group interviews as well as observation. Section 3, the findings and discussion, focuses first on land governance and indigenous communities. This assesses the situation of indigenous people and how communities have changed, using community history analysis based on the fieldwork. It also looks at legal and institutional support for the collective land titling of indigenous communities and economic land concessions in Cambodia. An analysis of the UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) programme related to indigenous communities uses data obtained mostly from desk-based research. The second part of Section 3 is an assessment of the impacts of economic land concessions on indigenous people and communities. A household survey and focus group interviews were used to collect information for this. Interviews focused on how the livelihoods of indigenous families changed when economic land concessions were set up in the community. The paper also highlights the views of respondents from government agencies and civil society. Section 4 of the paper produces conclusions and some recommendations.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This paper seeks to add to the growing literature on land concessions by examining a recent, high-level concession as a means of understanding three aspects related to concessionary investments: (1) the process by which concessions are awarded and implemented; (2) the intricate relationship between land use, land tenure, and land ownership in the face of concessions; and (3) the way in which village and household livelihoods are impacted due to such massive land use and ownership changes. The case study at hand is the concession of land use rights to log timber and grow rubber on a 10,000 hectare (ha) plot of land for 35 years in Attapeu province, southern Laos. These rights were awarded to the Hoàng Anh Gia Lai (HAGL) Joint Stock Company, a multinational Vietnamese corporation with diversified business activities including rubber growth and processing, mining, hydropower, real estate, and sports franchises. HAGL was able to acquire such a large tract of land in part because of aid they provided to the Lao government to construct the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games athletes’ village. The connection between the athletes’ village and the concession is little known and thus the report aims to highlight the way in which the SEA Games, in addition to being a sporting event, is also a project of national development with political, economic, and social implications.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper argues that research into the dynamics of land control in the contemporary ‘land grab’ can benefit from engagement with the literature on booms in the production of crops like cocoa, coffee, fast-growing trees, oil palm, rubber and shrimp in Southeast Asia. This literature can help answer three key questions: who seeks to exercise control over land for the purpose of growing export-oriented crops under boom conditions; how would-be producers bring to bear regulatory power, market power, force, and legitimation to gain control over land; and how booms differentially affect areas with secure and insecure land control relations.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS OF THE CHAPTER: In this chapter I consider these recent transformations by analyzing how changes in land tenure have also affected ethnic identities. Such identities are not fi xed and have to be understood, as stated in Chapter 1, as being produced in social contexts at all scales, including the national level. And they also are infl uenced and fed by differentiations and identifi cation pro- cesses. I explore here the way in which the new state-led and -imposed land model (that is, individual tenure and land titling) infl uences social relations within each ethnic group, among neighbouring groups, and with higher political institutions. Specifi cally, do land reforms lead to a homogenization of society through the erosion of ethnic identities? Or is ethnicity still useful to understand rural society in highland Vietnam? To answer these questions, I compare the experiences of two ethnic groups in northern Vietnam. The Thái (1.3 million in 1999) and the Tày (1.5 mil- lion) are the two largest groups of a dozen Tai-speaking peoples in Vietnam (a total of 3.8 million). The names of these two groups are the Vietnamese offi cial ethnonyms (or exonyms, names given to an ethnic group from the outside), but they also happen to be their autonyms (names created and used by the people themselves), a relatively rare occurrence in the region. It can sometimes come as a surprise to people new to Southeast Asia that a few million Tai speakers live throughout northern Vietnam, which can be explained through ancient migration paths from China into the peninsula.</style>

Ultimately, the piece negates oft heard assertions that decollectivisation in Vietnam has led to cultural homogenization under new land titling policies, while highlighting the complexity of challenges faced by communities often assumed to be incapable of negotiating their own adaptive pathways. The chapter argues that ethnic communities are not simply static, fragile groups at the whim of external influence. Rather, agency plays a complex role in shaping responses of community leaders, interactions between groups and myriad adaptations to changing land laws and policies.;Policy-law-rel: Vietnam implemented decollectivization in varied and somewhat uneven ways, in response to recognition that cooperatives were failing. Although the process began in the 1980s, it was not reflected in land policy until 1993 (and even then it was not ‘officially’ recognised by the state until much later). This points to a broader tension between socialist ideology (in which land is owned “by the people” as a whole and managed in trust by the State), and private land tenure, one which Vietnam has had to mindfully navigate in order to maintain some form of socialist state identity. This seemingly haphazard process has permitted some communities the time needed to adjust in ways that have allowed them to negotiate and establish new and relatively equitable arrangements for accessing land (albeit not in all cases). However, the primary concern of the state seems to have been oriented towards maintaining the legitimacy of its own communist identity.;</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Housing, land and property rights issues affect men and women differently; hence these issues are not gender-neutral and require a gender equality analysis of the problem. While equal rights between men and women are enshrined in the 1993 Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia (the Constitution) and in a number of national laws, in practice women are still subordinate to men. The Survey findings are presented in detail in the succeeding sections of this Report, and provide empirical evidence as to the negative impact of forced evictions; it is also the objective of this survey to outline the disproportionate effects of forced evictions on women, which constitutes a direct violation not only of women’s rights to adequate housing but also of their economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights. The objectives of the Survey are to: 1. Identify the basic profile of women respondents and their informal settlements. 2. Gather the perceptions of women on their eviction problem and how they view their plight before, during and after an eviction. 3. Gather the views of women on how efforts on the part of themselves and their communities, and by the RGC and NGOs, have adequately addressed their situation and provided solutions to their plight. 4. Establish links between violence against women and forced evictions based on the experiences of the respondents. 5. Identify gender-equal, gender-responsive and human rights-based recommendations for the RGC and NGOs in order to secure the right to adequate housing for urban poor women and their families.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In the early 20th century, the scientific management of Myanmar’s natural forests under the Myanmar Selection System (MSS) was world-renown.1 By the 1970s, the MSS began to break down. Today, the application of scientific forestry in the country has been marginalized. Timber remains a significant source of revenue, although relatively less for the national Myanmar government as multi-billion dollar oil, gas, hydropower and other energy related contracts surge. Timber and other forest products represent a significant source of income for ethnic political groups, most notably in Kachin State along the border with China and Karen State along the Thai border. The Government of Myanmar has established development priorities in a number of sectors, including agriculture and forestry, but these plans are not detailed and mainly focus on output indicators. Overall, 70% of Myanmar’s population residing in rural areas (50-60% of the estimated total population of 60 million) depend heavily on forests for their basic needs (FAO, 2009). Some 500,000 people are thought to be dependent on the forestry sector for employment. The contribution of forestry to GDP was an estimated 1% in 1997–98 (ITTO, 2006), but timber exports alone constitute approximately 10% of Myanmar’s total official export earnings. Teak alone contributes 60-70% of the export earnings from forest products, but these exports are of an increasingly low-grade, which command lower prices than the high-quality teak that made Myanmar famous. Myanmar remains one of the world’s only countries with no prohibitions on log exports. The country provides much coveted teak and other hardwood logs to the region and beyond. Sawn wood, and to a lesser extent finished wood products, contribute a relatively small amount to Myanmar’s total exports of wood products. As in the majority of Mekong countries, one of the most significant trends affecting forest lands in Myanmar relates to the considerable, and often times informal, foreign direct investments (FDI) in agribusiness plantations such as rubber, oil palm, timber plantation, cashew nut and other horticultural crops. FD are also being made in other resource sector developments, including hydropower and mineral extraction. These types of developments often require the clearing of natural forest areas and has led to land disputes with local communities. Virtually all FDI in Myanmar currently comes from other Asian countries, notably Thailand, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Agricultural accumulation has been one of the main source determined the social differentiation in Vietnamese countryside. The complexities of agrarian changes under the post - socialist industrialization with high rate of agricultural land conversion in recent context reveal the new forms of capital accumulation and social differentiation. This research investigates how land conversion process to industrial zones and clusters affected to the way that different groups of peasant households accumulate their resources. The study was carried out in 3 districts of Hung Yen province from 2006 to 2010. The study results are as follows: first, the land conversion to industrialization has impact on not only the decline of household landholdings but also the changes value of land which are the sources of social conflicts and informal land transfer. Second, in the context of land conversion to industrialization with tiny plots of land, low return from agricultural production and more opportunities of non-farm activities, even when non-farm employment is very profitable, peasant households are not likely to give up their land but maintaining agricultural production for not only their basic and secure livelihood but also for their identity. Third, among the affected peasant groups, the households with non-farm background tend to be in better position in engaging to high - earning activities. They are likely the rich peasants in opposed to the poor group with farming background and lost more than 50% of their agricultural land. This research has showed that the industrialization policies have to deal with the proportion of agricultural land would be transferred for industrialization zones and other measures in order to limit the conflicts as well as the social differentiation in countryside.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Having a sound planning system for land, soils and water in the future, the Phnom Penh authorities are able to guide and restrict the use of properties and resources in order to protect and promote the public interest. Social housing and open space for recreation should generally be defined as apublic purpose. The public pur- pose should include clear regulations for relo- cation and expropriation only as ultima ratio instruments, combined with fair and just com- pensation following the rule of law.Different institutions and regulations for land manage- ment and land distribution havetobebuilt up, not only in Phnom Penh municipality,but for the entire territory of Cambodia. Suchstrategies could consist of5: • the rule of law and legally binding planning determinations (zoning ordinances); • different common and communal property rights and tenure securities for urban lands be- yond the 100% private property rights solution; • State Land Management with non-transfer- able public communal property and aState in- ventory of plots and assets; • leasehold tenure models including coopera- tives and associations (économie sociale) for the urban poor and for landless people on State public property,and • the land market, based on land and business valuation methods to identify land rental values and to revise legal sub-decrees setting conces- sion fee rates for businesses and usage charges for natural resources, e.g., fishing in the Me- kong River.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">A landscape simulation was designed and tested in Viengkham, a mountainous district in the north of Lao PDR. This social learning process was introduced by researchers affiliated with national research institutions to improve land use planning practices and increase the ownership of local people in the planning process. Twelve members of the village land management committees participated in the role play called PLUP Fiction, which is part of a stepwise process of participatory land use planning (PLUP). This article introduces the principles of land zoning, the sequence of events presented during the role play session, and the lessons learned from a series of experiments conducted in remote upland villages. The villagers gained an increased understanding of the issues at stake during a zoning process, thus demonstrating the relevance of this learning simulation tool. They were able to explore different zoning options, assess their respective advantages and constraints, and gradually improve their understanding of the consequences of land zoning on the environmental and economic values of the resulting landscape. The villagers also felt empowered by their newly acquired knowledge and well disposed toward negotiations to improve their current land use through more realistic plans. Long-term environmental concerns (ie biodiversity and carbon values) were fully integrated with shorter-term economic considerations in the collective decision-making process. Furthermore, PLUP Fiction has become a key tool for fully involving local communities in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) through negotiations that are taking place during a land use planning process.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE SUMMARY: Land-grabbing is occurring at a significant extent and pace in Southeast Asia; some of the characteristics of this land grab differ from those in regions such as Africa. At a glance, Europe is not a high profile, major driver of land-grabbing in this region, but a closer examination reveals that it nonetheless is playing a significant role. This influence is both direct and indirect, through European corporate sector and public policies, as well as through multilateral agencies within which EU states are members. Looking at some of the cases of large-scale land acquisition in Southeast Asia, and the role played by the European Union, we put forward several observations and issues for discussion.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Environment and poverty nexus is still a polemical issue. Some schools of thought claim that it is poverty that has the major effect on the environment, while another perspective suggests that the environment has more impact on the poor than vice-versa because the poor have no power to exploit the environment. In the context of Cambodia, there is a general consensus that the poor, particularly those living in rural areas, are heavily dependent on the environment i.e. common property resources. If the environment is degraded, the livelihoods of those people will definitely be severely affected. This paper aims to address the impact of environmental degradation on poverty in Cambodia. We use the Cambodia Socio-economic Survey in 2007 (CSES 2007) and other available secondary data to examine the impact of environmental income (forestry and hunting) and that of environmental variables such as flood, drought, and land erosion on poverty. Following Cavendish (1999), we use a simple descriptive method to assess the former hypothesis. To take other factors into account, probit regression method is adopted to investigate the latter. The study also attempts to examine household risk coping strategies and limitations in response to environmental change, as well as the government’s mitigation and coping strategies. The results show that poverty rate will increase by an average of 16.3 percent if rural households are unable to access forestry and hunting at all, of which the headcount ratio in Tonle Sap (wetland) is likely to edge up by 14.1 percent. Drought is likely to increase the poverty rate by 6 percent, while flood decreases it by 4 percent. The unexpected result for the case of flood is largely because it is commonly viewed as a source of profit rather than a source of disaster as it usually contributes to the wealth of biodiversity, abundance of fish and soil fertility in Cambodia (MRC 2006). Meanwhile, we also find that a 1 percent increase in land erosion (land productivity as proxy) raises the poverty rate by 3 percent.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">FROM PUBLISHERS DESCRIPTION: Questions of who can access land and who is excluded from it underlie many recent social and political conflicts in Southeast Asia. Powers of Exclusion examines the key processes through which shifts in land relations are taking place, notably state land allocation and provision of property rights, the dramatic expansion of areas zoned for conservation, booms in the production of export-oriented crops, the conversion of farmland to post-agrarian uses, “intimate” exclusions involving kin and co-villagers, and mobilizations around land framed in terms of identity and belonging. In case studies drawn from seven countries, the authors find that four “powers of exclusion”—regulation, the market, force and legitimation—have combined to shape land relations in new and often surprising ways. Land debates are often presented as a conflict between market-oriented land use with full private property rights on the one side, and equitable access, production for subsistence, and respect for custom on the other. The authors step back from these debates to point out that any productive use of land requires the exclusion of some potential users, and that most projects for transforming land relations are thus accompanied by painful dilemmas. Rather than counterposing “exclusion” to “inclusion,” the book argues that attention must be paid to who is excluded, how, why, and with what consequences.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Access to arable land is key to pro-poor agricultural production. Although nearly 69 percent of the rural population in Cambodia is engaged in smallholder farming, the average size of cultivated land per farming household only amounts to less than one hectare, and 14.7 percent of rural farmers do not possess land at all. In order to accomplish a more equitable distribution of land, the discussion over ‘land-grabbing’ needs to be advanced to the promotion of smallholder-inclusive approaches, such as partnership farming between smallholders and agribusinesses.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Following the »Land Policy Declaration« from July 2009, the Royal Government of Cambodia henceforth has the unique opportunity to implement a land valuation policy by the Council of Land Policy. Land valuation, taxation and capac- ity building are indispensable elements of a land reform in Cambodia. By improving prior assessment tools for valuation and taxation, Cambodia could serve as an example for the development of taxation in circumstances when rent-seeking, speculation, informal land markets and an unequal land dis- tribution occur. Property taxation – eventually supported by land value increment taxation – will become an important future source of the Cambodian revenue. Taxation should be ideally flanked by a coded, transparent and upgradeable prop- erty record system, by actualized or revised land valuation manuals and a holistic land information infrastructure due to international standards.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This document presents selected analyses of key issues in CFM in Vietnam. It brings together contributions by leading analysts and thinkers and is organized in three main parts: Part 1 discusses issues related to the transfer of forest rights to local people through FLA. It starts with an overview of FLA policy and its outcomes by Nguyen Quang Tan and Thomas Sikor. A case study by Nguyen Dinh Tien, Tran Duc Vien and Nguyen Thanh Lam alerts readers to the fact that too much emphasis on conservation objectives may endanger the food security of the local people. Luong Thi Truong and Orlando Genotiva call for the recognition of customary land rights of ethnic people to avoid potential conflicts and to promote economic, political, and cultural development among ethnic minorities. Part 2 relates CFM to two influential policy frameworks new to the forestry sector in Vietnam. Juergen Hess and To Thi Thu Huong introduce readers to Payment for Forest Environmental Services (PFES), a new financing mechanism for forest management in Vietnam, and argue for the critical importance of CFM in making PFES work. Nguyen Quang Tan and Thomas Sikor argue that Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in Vietnam should employ a community-based approach to involve local people. Part 3 turns to the question of how CFM can move forward in Vietnam. Nguyen Quang Tan and Thomas Sikor start with an analysis of the rationale for community forest management in Vietnam. Using examples from various parts of Vietnam, they identify five reasons it is important to entrust local people to manage a larger share of the country’s forests. Lai Tung Quan and Suriya Vij present a case study that illustrates the importance of involving the local community in protected area management. Do Anh Tuan and co-authors argue that Vietnam’s legal framework should recognize the diversity of governance structure for CFM, including household groups in addition to entire village communities. Finally, a short essay by Thomas Sikor and Nguyen Quang Tan concludes with concrete suggestions on how to move CFM forward in Vietnam.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Corruption in land management from the perspective of a simple risk framework. These risk factors and forms of corruption spring from more general shortcomings in the integrity framework. In this regard, this report argues that corruption is most likely to occur when an official or office has a monopoly, when the official or office has a great deal of discretion over how the decision is taken, and when there is little accountability for that decision or transparency, which might make it harder for the corruption to proceed unabated. Some public services may often require monopoly or a measure of discretion in provision, and in such cases, transparency and accountability are especially needed. And of course, there are often alternatives that better circumscribe the discretion and monopoly in the first place. The book analyzes and explains the causes of corruption in land administration and the existing types of corruption. Based on the analysis of the types of corruption and identification of the risk factors that are generating corruption in land management, the authors propose actions for each specific type of corruption and make some recommendations for prevention. This book represents the views of foreign institutions. The views and analysis of political and legal terms in this book only represent the views and opinions of the writers, not the official views of the party and our state. In order to provide a diverse set of viewpoints, we generally keep the authors' original text; although in some places we edited and footnoted to assist readers of the book.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cooperatives, associations, partnerships, non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are core elements of the Social Economy. Social Economy as an economic and societal development approach could support the sustainable rural and environmental management in South East Asian countries. Examples for Social Economy enterprises are microlending institutions, fishing and rice cooperatives in Vietnam and Thailand, pepper and pottery associations in Cambodia or rural and small scale industry commodities and service associations. The Social Economy needs just and equal distribution of property, but also innovative property tax collection models in order to guarantee sustainable financial support by the governments. The implementation faces several challenges. Existing private property or leasehold rights and large agricultural investment funds could lead to the exclusion of small and medium landowners, family- based farmers and to a lack of institutional support from higher political levels. A system combining different forms of public and private property and good land governance may be the means to bridge the gap between the private right to acquire natural resources and the needs of the Social Economy. The division of agricultural land, natural commodities and the means of production in a comprehensive and equal way between the people is of fundamental importance for the Asian states.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Daley, E. (2011). Strategies to Get Gender Onto the Agenda of the “Land Grab” Debate; Overall-rel: The author asserts that there are four central dimensions of female vulnerability which act to compromise their equitable access to land. The paper then structures four main policy recommendations around these four vulnerability themes in an attempt to broaden the scope of the gender equality debate within emerging commercial pressures on land. The aim of the brief is to contribute to more nuanced and effective gender based research tools which better address the root causes of gender inequality. Whilst the paper is brief, it is a good entry point into the complexities and challenges of creating gender equality within land governance.; Research-bas: The brief is based on a series of case studies carried out by researchers working for the International Land Coalition (ICL) in specific countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa.; CivilSociety-Donors-rel: Donor funded and civil society initiatives that seek to include a gender perspective in their land programs and global advocacy often risk developing over-simplistic “gender sensitive” tools that are seen as an imposition of foreign norms and sometimes inappropriate to local contexts. Women’s groups, and their engagement in broader social movements, have met complex challenges indicative of various competing ideas about how best to advocate for gender issues within broader coalitions. While these challenges continue to be debated, positive collaborations are possible through lateral engagement between women’s groups and the broader donor landscape. Importantly, gender sensitive tools must acknowledge the complexity of gender issues, and they must be relevant and appropriate in a local context if they are going to affect any positive change.; Formalisation-titling-rel: Programs that seek to enhance the productivity of “marginal” or common lands through increased regularisation often threaten the fluid and informal rights that women have with productive resources. Women are often losers in programs that seek to increase security of tenure through the formalisation of land titles, because of their socially subordinate positions in largely male dominated village structures. Their tenure arrangements are largely informal, and when a decision is made about who ultimately ‘owns’ the land they cultivate, there is an embedded assumption that a male’s claim is more legitimate.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Inheritance rights, discrimination against non-heteronormative household structures, and a general lack of interest from authorities in gender equality together comprise the invisible dimensions of power that prevent women from accessing land, creating a landscape of gender inequality that is very difficult to shift. Assumptions and assertions about the ‘naturalness’ of these dominant/subordinate relations further entrench ideas about the inevitability of gender inequality. In the context of increasing commercial pressure on land, women as a group are disproportionately more likely to be negatively affected than men. The author highlights the four-fold vulnerability that women contend with vis-à-vis men, including: systemic discrimination related to land access, ownership and control; systemic discrimination related to decision-making; relative income poverty; and general physical vulnerability.; Policy-law-rel: Women face constraints and systemic discrimination which affects their access, ownership and control of land, including the level of legal protection of their land rights. Even when existing policies and laws attempt to implement gender equality, these do not address socially and culturally embedded inequalities, which are the source of subordination. The generality of laws and policies make them weak and ineffective, as they are not developed to challenge the root causes of gender inequality.;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Swidden (also called shifting cultivation) has long been the dominant farming system in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA). Today the ecological bounty of this region is threatened by the expansion of settled agriculture, including the proliferation of rubber plantations. In the current conception of REDD+, landscapes involving swidden qualify almost automatically for replacement by other land-use systems because swiddens are perceived to be degraded and inefficient with regard to carbon sequestration. However, swiddening in some cases may be carbon-neutral or even carbon positive, compared with some other types of land-use systems. In this paper we describe how agricultural policies and institutions have affected land use in the region over the last several decades and the impact these policies have had on the livelihoods of swiddeners and other smallholders. We also explore whether incentivizing transitions away from swiddening to the cultivation of rubber will directly or reliably produce carbon gains. We argue that because government policies affect how land is used, they also influence carbon emissions, farmer livelihoods, environmental services, and a host of other variables. A deeper and more systematic analysis of the multiple consequences of these policies is consequently necessary for the design of successful REDD+ policies in MMSEA, and other areas of the developing world. REDD + policies should be structured not so much to 'hold the forest boundary' but to influence the types of land-use changes that are occurring so that they support both sustainable livelihoods and environmental services, including (but not limited to) carbon.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">As in other rapidly growing economies, Vietnam's urban land development has been a source of social conflict as those who are relocated contest the distribution of economic gains. More recently, the relocated have increased their bargaining power and receive better compensation packages. The paper analyses this situation to discuss further developing our understanding of how property rights institutions change. The case study shows the efficacy of social narratives to renegotiate the terms of the social contract supporting property rights even in a society with limited means for public participation in governmental reform. Secondly, it illuminates that modern property rights are entwined with public finance and so property rights reforms are tied to the organisational structure of government and fiscal relations.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The relationship between the development industry and the problems it claims to address is problematic. Development studies have often found development practice systematically mis- representing its context with the result that interventions are out of kilter with reality and fail. in a series of articles in the early 2000s Antony Bebbington suggested development geographers attend to the spatial distribution of development interventions by mapping and explaining immanent development, mapping and explaining intentional development and studying the relationships between them. this article uses the case of property rights interventions in cambodia to examine the extent that Bebbington’s approach might explain development interventions and their relationship to the contexts into which they are inserted. Primary data consist of in- terviews with key actors involved in decisions over the locations of these interventions. Secondary data consist of reports and databas- es showing their geographical spread, and political and social sci- ence literature explaining the main transitions in recent cambodian history. the main empirical finding is that the interventions, land titling and community forestry, have not been implemented in the places where the problems they are claimed to address are located. the methodological reflection is that Bebbington’s approach valu- ably challenges policy narratives that tend to smooth space and conceal unevenness. However, it provides only a broad theoretical framework rather than any theoretical content. the approach may only realize its potential when Bebbington and others begin to ap- ply it to generate hypotheses and theory. A new hypothesis emerg- ing from the cambodian case is briefly introduced in this regard.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Debates and critiques around land policy often focus on the neo-liberal agenda of formalising land as alienable property, most notably through land titling schemes. Sometimes these schemes are posited against alternatives such as land reform and community land holding under common property arrangements. Claims and counter- claims are made for land titling as a means to boost smallholder security in the face of involuntary or otherwise unfair alienation of land sometimes under the rubric of land grabbing. This paper problematises the ways in which assertions are made on behalf of land titling, critiques are constructed against formalised title in land, and debates are framed in the context of land grabbing. A diverse range of perspectives on land titling in Southeast Asia reveals not only contrary positions, but also lines of argument that talk past each other as often as they engage with one another. Underlying this rather unsatisfactory way in which an important policy arena is discussed at both academic and societal levels is a set of conundrums based as much in internal contradictions and dilemmas as in clear alternatives between different land policy approaches. The paper draws on land titling experience in several Southeast Asian countries to illustrate these conundrums and the ways in which land titling is understood by different actors vis-a-vis issues of security of tenure. It begins by outlining the land titling programs and their place within wider land policy and land politics in different countries. It discusses the commonalities associated with a particular approach to land titling supported by the international development establishment, and it sets this against the quite different historical, societal and political contexts in each country in which the approach has been applied. The paper then goes on to identify a range of positions on titling articulated by various actors, linking them where relevant to land grabbing instances and discourses. Problematic positions of advocates and critics of land titling are then discussed, and the paper concludes by calling for debates on land formalisation as alienable property that are more clearly aligned around some key questions relevant to land grabbing.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article deals with aspects of official land registers in pre-colonial and colonial Vietnam and their relationship with marginal lands since the eleventh century and especially since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The changing pattern of land ownership and control is studied in detail in one specific village in the Red River Delta of northern Viet- nam. Several practices of land use and land distribution are discussed, as are various efforts in parts of Vietnam to expand agricultural land, in particular near rivers and coasts, espe- cially as a result of land reclamation. The study of marginal lands is focused on alluvial lands, which were seen originally as empty or waste lands but gradually developed into safety nets for the poor. The traditional social function of these communal waste lands, managed by village elites, was eroded and became a tool for manipulation in the hands of state and village authorities.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In recent years the Lao government has provided many foreign investors with large-scale economic land concessions to develop plantations. These concessions have resulted in significant alterations of landscapes and ecological processes, greatly reduced local access to resources through enclosing common areas, and ultimately leading to massive changes in the livelihoods of large numbers of mainly indigenous peoples living near these concessions. Many have lost their agricultural and forest lands, or means of production, making it difficult for them to maintain their former semi-subsistence livelihoods, and thus compelling many to take up employment on the same plantations that displaced them, despite having to work for low wages and under poor conditions. Using two case studies involving large economic land concessions in southern Laos, I argue that applying the theoretical concept of primitive accumulation is useful for better understanding the political processes and motivations of government officials, and their justifications for the rural dispossession that is occurring in a nominally ‘socialist’ country.</style>

Turning Land into Capital, Turning People into Labor: Primitive Accumulation and the Arrival of Large-Scale Economic Land Concessions in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. New Proposals: Journal of Marxism and Interdisciplinary Inquiry, (5)1: 10-26; Overall-rel: This article explores the rationalization behind the Lao government’s modernist project of turning land into capital and farmers into labourers through the issuing of large-scale economic land concessions to foreign investors. The transformation of agricultural land, forest land and other commons previously used by smallholders for their livelihoods into large monoculture plantations controlled by companies is part of the government’s vision to “modernise” agriculture by turning land to more productive uses. A key component of the modernist project is to transform subsistence or semi-subsistence farmers, and particularly indigenous people, into wage labourers by forcibly removing them from their means of production. The article stresses the ongoing relevance and usefulness of the concept of primitive accumulation to explain the large scale rural dispossession occurring in this nominally socialist country. ; Research-bas: The data used in the article, including the two case studies in southern Laos, has been collected intermittently by the author over the past 15 years. It also draws on information collected by indigenous and ethnic Lao staff working for the NGO Global Association for People and the Environment (GAPE), which the author was executive director of in 2001-2010.; AgriculturalModernisation-rel: The drive for modernisation is particularly acute in post-socialist countries such as Laos where ideas of socialist modernity still permeate. A prevalent belief among many Lao government officials is that forcibly removing small-scale farmers and indigenous people from what they see as “unproductive” (non-capitalist) modes of subsistence agriculture so they become dependent on wage labour is a “necessary evil” in order for Laos to develop into a modern capitalist economy. The economic land concession system and other land policies encouraging violent capitalist accumulation through dispossession are controversial and are predicated on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about the labour absorption capacity of agricultural plantations and other industrial sectors.; Conversion-FoodSecurity-rel: The development of large scale economic land concessions is resulting in the rapid conversion of landscapes to industrial plantations and having significant impacts on rural populations, particularly indigenous peoples. The sudden loss of agricultural land, common forests and grazing land has impacted people’s ability to produce food for family consumption and prompted dramatic livelihood shifts. These impacts affect people differently. While some households and individuals are able to adapt to changes more readily, such as by selling labour to purchase food, this option is not always available to different groups, such as the elderly or female headed households.; Dispossession-grabbing-rel: In Laos, the policy to “turn land into capital” deviates from the neoliberal idea of rural smallholders turning their most valuable asset (land) into a household level wealth-generating engine. Instead, the policy drive is to turn a purportedly land-abundant country’s asset into national wealth through expropriation. Farmers receive little or no compensation for agricultural and forest land that is appropriated, particularly if it is swidden fields, while labour opportunities on the plantations that seldom materialise.; FDI-rel: In Laos, the shift in land policy towards issuing large land concessions to foreign investors coincided with a number of factors: declining confidence of the Lao government in the ability of small farmers to increase crop production for export; erosion of original socialist ideals of the government; increasing penetration of market economics; and increased predilection for corrupt behaviour including bribing of government officials at village, provincial and central level by companies in exchange for land concessions. Demand for economic land concessions in Laos has mainly come from investors in neighbouring China, Thailand and Vietnam. In southern Laos, the largest recipients of land concessions are Vietnamese investors in rubber plantations. In northern Laos, Chinese capital dominates the commercialisation of land mainly for rubber and, more recently, bananas.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Entwined in the Lao government’s vision for a modernised economy is the perception that “backward” farmers – especially ethnic minorities – should become wage workers to hasten progress. As a first step, it is hoped that large scale rubber plantations can replace swidden agriculture and that permanent jobs bring an end to slash-and-burn agriculture.;</style>

Farmers receive little or no compensation for agricultural and forest land that is appropriated, particularly if it is swidden fields, while labour opportunities on the plantations that seldom materialise.; FDI-rel: In Laos, the shift in land policy towards issuing large land concessions to foreign investors coincided with a number of factors: declining confidence of the Lao government in the ability of small farmers to increase crop production for export; erosion of original socialist ideals of the government; increasing penetration of market economics; and increased predilection for corrupt behaviour including bribing of government officials at village, provincial and central level by companies in exchange for land concessions. Demand for economic land concessions in Laos has mainly come from investors in neighbouring China, Thailand and Vietnam. In southern Laos, the largest recipients of land concessions are Vietnamese investors in rubber plantations. In northern Laos, Chinese capital dominates the commercialisation of land mainly for rubber and, more recently, bananas.; MarginalisedPeople-rel: Entwined in the Lao government’s vision for a modernised economy is the perception that “backward” farmers – especially ethnic minorities – should become wage workers to hasten progress. As a first step, it is hoped that large scale rubber plantations can replace swidden agriculture and that permanent jobs bring an end to slash-and-burn agriculture.;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper discusses the recent rise in land disputes in the rapidly urbanizing outskirts of Hanoi. It presents emerging social conflicts as resulting from a clash between the rules and practices of urbanization as devised and regulated locally by periurban people and the territorialization projects that municipal authorities and land developers try to impose on them. At the heart of these conflicts are expropriations of large tracts of periurban land by state-backed developers and the reforms of local institutions that facilitate this process. Using the case of a village recently annexed to the city, this paper examines how local people resort to contentious politics to resist this urban encroachment. The paper finds that groups of elderly villagers assumed a leading role in crafting and deploying acts and discourses of resistance, relying on state-promoted values to support their claim. It further suggests that, while periurban villagers acknowledge the necessity of integrating their locality into Hanoi’s urban fabric and governance system, they rise up when this process threatens moral relationships inherited from the prerevolutionary and collectivization periods.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">OVERVIEW: Cambodia is a largely agrarian country that emerged from a history of political strife and instability into a period of steady economic growth. However, the country started from such a low base that even after a decade of growth averaging 7% per annum, GDP is only $650. Cambodia is ranked 176th out of 213 countries in terms of purchasing-power parity. Poverty rates have reduced somewhat, but they remain higher than in most countries in the region and are only slightly lower than in Laos. At the same time, inequality has increased in Cambodia, in part due to the growing concentration of productive assets, especially land. Inequality in landholdings is among the highest in the region. Furthermore, lack of transparency in many rural land transactions and extensive granting of concessions by the state for economic development have resulted in widespread disputes and conflict over land ownership and use. Unless there is a rapid increase in off-farm employment or other livelihood opportunities to absorb landless labor, the concentration of land in fewer hands will mean a growing gap in the opportunities available to different types of rural households. These factors could jeopardize the ability of Cambodia to continue its rapid economic and social progress. Improving land administration and enforcing established land laws will be critical to ensuring that Cambodia‘s progress benefits all its people. Cambodia‘s abundant water resources, forestland, and the prospect of large oil and gas reserves create additional opportunities for economic growth and development. The government has been creating large-scale programs to increase the amount of irrigated land to support increased agricultural production and plans to construct new dams to harness the hydropower potential in the country‘s rivers. The first production from the offshore oil and gas reserves is expected in 2012 and concessions granted or in negotiation for five additional blocks. The Prime Minister‘s denouncement of illegal logging and corruption within forestry offices in 2010 is a recent reflection of growing political will for enforcement of existing laws protecting the country‘s natural resources and the rights of local communities to land and forest products. The challenge will be ensuring that those rights and interests continue to be recognized in the years ahead.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">OVERVIEW: The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a landlocked country situated in Southeast Asia, bordering Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Myanmar. Despite a recent increase in the rate of urbanization and a relatively small amount of arable land per capita, most people in Lao PDR live in rural areas and work in an agriculture sector dominated by subsistence farming. Lao PDR’s economy relies heavily on its natural resources, with over half the country’s wealth produced by agricultural land, forests, water and hydropower and mineral resources. All land in Lao PDR belongs to the population as a whole. The state administers the land on the people’s behalf, and individuals and organizations access land through land-use rights. Recent land titling programs have formalized permanent land-use rights in urban and peri-urban areas, and land allocation programs have formalized temporary land-use rights for agricultural and forest land. Communal tenure, which is common in rural areas, has not been formalized. Individual use rights in rural areas are short-term and insecure. Land concessions to foreign investors are controversial in Lao PDR due to their social and environmental impacts. The Government of Lao PDR (GOL) has expressed its intention to address these issues when revising the land law. Although draft amendments were submitted to the National Assembly in 2012, the revisions have not yet been adopted.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">OVERVIEW: Thailand is facing the challenges of a transition from lower- to upper-middle-income status. After decades of very rapid growth followed by more modest 5–6% growth after the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, Thailand achieved a per capita GNI of US $3670 by 2008, reduced its poverty rate to less than 10% and greatly extended coverage of social services. Infant mortality has been cut to only 13 per 1000, and 98% of the population has access to clean water and sanitation. The country‘s challenges are to accelerate productivity through: specialization; innovation and technological advances; improvements in the quality of education and workforce training; and investment in basic services and infrastructure, in order to compete successfully with other middle-income exporting countries. At the same time, in order for Thailand to ensure the necessary social cohesion, the growth process has to benefit the poor and other vulnerable groups and protect the environment. Thailand‘s efficient, transparent land administration system is a model for other countries. It has issued title deeds to large portions of the country‘s population, thus contributing to tenure security and developing a robust land market. However, the system has not reached many residents of the rapidly growing informal settlements in urban and peri-urban areas, nor has it addressed the rights of occupants of the country‘s forestland. Natural-resource degradation has occurred as a consequence of Thailand‘s rapid urbanization and industrialization. In addition to forest degradation, the country‘s water resources are poorly managed, unevenly distributed and increasingly polluted. A comprehensive water law and effective enforcement are needed to address issues of water allocation, fees for water use, and the authority of river basin committees. Similarly, legislation is needed to address the competition for control over forestland among conservation interests, forest communities and mining companies. Finally, land rights need to be addressed in the country‘s mining law and regulatory framework. All this must be accomplished to avoid natural-resource degradation becoming a serious impediment to Thailand‘s continued economic and social progress.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper attempts to define the factors which determine emigration and rice doublecropping, i.e. rice cultivation on the same plot twice per year, by rural households in Cambodia, and investigates whether these decisions influence each other using data from a two-period panel survey of 231 households in three provinces in rural Cambodia. In the analysis, we take into account possible correlation between these decisions (through estimating a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model) and unobserved heterogeneity among farmers (through estimating a random-effects probit model). It is found that rice double-cropping and emigration decisions are not closely inter-related. We can also conclude that the availability of water and agricultural land are the key determinants of rice double-cropping. Households which rely on animal draught power for agricultural production are unlikely to engage in rice double-cropping. Policies aimed at increasing irrigation and providing socioeconomic land concessions in rural areas may play a critical role in improving agricultural production.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Political dynamics of the global land grab are exemplified in Cambodia, where at least 27 forced evictions took place in 2009, affecting 23,000 people. Evictions of the rural poor are legitimized by the assumption that non-private land is idle, marginal, or degraded and available for capitalist exploitation. This paper: (1) questions the assumption that land is idle; (2) explores whether land grabs can be regulated through a ‘code of conduct’; and (3) examines peasant resistance to land grabs. Overall, the Cambodian case studies confirm that land grabs are not benefiting the rural poor, but they challenge the process of dispossession. Although ‘everyday forms of peasant politics’ are prevalent, more organized and structured forms of political contention by rural poor communities and their NGO allies are slowly emerging.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In this chapter, I adapt the game approach to examine the differences and conformities between formal legal laws and under-law regulations of the party- state institutions and the real practices of the Red river delta villagers139 on the holding and use of agricultural land. More specifically, this chapter emphasizes official norms, in this case the study of agricultural land claims regarded as formal legal laws and under-law regulations of the party-state institutions. Furthermore, it examines how and why the practices of agricultural land claims of villagers from the Red River Delta contradict with such official norms overthe holding of use rights on certain areas or plots of agricultural land during the 1980s-1990s agricultural decollectivization period. Endorsing the arguments made in the available literature on this topic, the chapter postulates that there is a major gap between official norms and villagers’ practices in Vietnam’s rural areas. It also highlights the space for the villagers to move around what the party-state wants to do (through its policy) and the people’s struggle to pursue their everyday needs and desires. In this chapter, I also discuss the importance of land property rights and indicate how the everyday practices of land holdings and land use have influenced the official norms of the party-state over the question of ownership, management and use of agricultural land in contemporary Vietnam.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The paper aims to identify the rationality of peasant communities and their contribution to rural development in Kampong Thom province. To do so; an interdisciplinary analytical framework addresses the dynamics of land use and land tenure; the strategies of labor force allocation as well as the determinants of land and labor agricultural productivities amongst peasant communities. It rests on details field surveys in two communes located in very distinct agro-ecological settings of Kampong Thom province. A land use change analysis based on time-series aerial photos is conducted with participatory inventories of natural resources. It shows that endogenous management of forest and fisheries resources generate significant incomes and; at the same time; contribute to maintaining biodiversity. The paper analyses how this contribution is challenged by the non-peasant actors involved in massive State land privatization. Aiming to full employment; peasant households enjoy a great flexibility in the way they allocate labor force; especially in line with the age of active labor and the fluctuation of labor opportunity costs. Principally due to an unequal land holding distribution; agricultural income is unfairly distributed but this inequality is actually balanced by the access to common-pool resources of crucial importance for the poorest and by the recourse to non farming activities; which is an important factor of socio-economic differentiation amongst households. The main economic indicators of rice production confirm that peasant households always try to maximize their income in step with the production factor they have in relatively less amount. A land market simulation stresses that; contrarily to theoretical assumptions; land access through sale (and purchase) does not result in a fairer land distribution. Nevertheless; land leases amongst peasant households seem more promising to ensure equitable access to land as they are embedded in collective security mechanisms activated by peasantry. The paper argues that peasant communities in the studied area constitute a solid basis for rural development as they offer a very good articulation between economic efficiency; social justice and environmental sustainability. Finally; recommendations are formulated to properly address peasant contribution to rural development in the new national agrarian policies.</style>

Water resources in the region will be shaped by a complex mixture of social, economic and environmental factors. This report reviews the current status and trends in water management in the Greater Mekong Subregion; assesses likely impacts of climate change on water resources to 2050; examines water management strategies in the context of climate and other changes; and identifies priority actions for governments and communities to improve resilience of the water sector and safeguard food production.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Community forests (CFs) in northern Burma have been gaining momentum since the mid-2000s, spearheaded by national NGOs, mostly in response to protect village land from encroaching agribusiness concessions. While the production of these new CF landscapes represents the material resistance against state-sponsored rubber, in effect it produces contested state authority by formalizing control of former customary swidden hills under the Forestry Department. The CF land management plans mirror state land classification schemes that delineate between „forest‟ and „agriculture‟ land uses, in stark contrast to traditional land management practices. For instances of post-war zones with continued contentious state authority, as is the case in Burma, rebuilding state- society resource relations and institutions present new challenges beyond the more narrow environmental conflict framework. This ethnographic case study challenges the “subsistence wars” premise, calls for in-depth area studies to understand the deep historical and political conflict driving so-called resource wars, and argues against the tendency to „aboralize‟ and „tribalize‟ indigenous people through collective forest management interventions. Overall this paper challenges several assumptions with advocating for collective property management as a conflict mediation strategy, and underscores the importance of development projects taking into account new forms of power and authority in post-war/conflict zones.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The current study attempts to examine whether large-scale agricultural investment of this type benefits the poor and how this investment can be implemented to increase benefits for the poor. It is arguable whether the poor need more land to grow crops to meet their food security requirements or need to benefit from large-scale agricultural investment in Cambodia. Although the poor households are capable of operating small plots of a few hectares each, they generally lack capital and the means to work large chunks of new land with forests or degrade forests. This is taken as a reason for government to provide large allocations of virgin lands as ELCs to companies. The rationale of ELCs is to increase economic activity and create employment, especially for the poor. The question remains, then, to what extent, have the poor benefited from the large-scale agricultural investment projects? The study aims to improve the understanding of the various ways in which large agricultural projects actually play out. It provides specific policy and practical recommendations to improve pro-poor benefits from the different types of existing large-scale agricultural investments, and in light of this advises how best to distribute or utilise new lands. Due to the lack of resources, the study cannot conduct social and environmental impact assessment for each case or projects selected for the study. Despite this limitation, the study highlights social and environmental concerns where appropriate and feasible.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper focuses on legal and economic instruments of the multi-donor-driven land reform in Cambodia with its overarching aim of achieving tenure security and reparation after the Khmer Rouge. Land tenure applies to state public/state private property and private property. The essential property form for public land management is state public property. This property must be interpreted in the future as the property of Cambodian people that serves all human beings in the country. Having a common, participatory and legally binding land use planning system for Cambodia, the planning authorities at the national down to the communal level are able to guide and to restrict the use of land in order to protect and promote the public interest. Private land use rights should not be mixed up with private property rights. Private land use under conditions of tenure security is far more efficient than state land use. Yet that does not automatically require private property. State public property with the guarantee for private land use, e.g. through transparent and participatory leasing and redistributed ground rents, ensures fair and equal redistribution of land if the Cambodian government enforces compliance with these regulations for the benefit of the local people.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The rise of urbanization and development in Cambodia in recent years has led to a dramatic increase in land prices, with particularly high values for land in the capital city of Phnom Penh.' Some government officials have benefited from the high price of land by unlawfully granting land title to private developers in exchange for compensation. Once these officials have granted land title to developers, they forcibly evict from the property existing residents, who mostly come from poor and marginalized communities.2 There is rampant corruption at every stage of the &quot;development&quot; process.3 Forced evictions as a result of development projects, land disputes, and land grabbing are now among the most widespread human rights violations in Cambodia.4 More than one hundred fifty thousand Cambodians are currently at risk of being forcibly evicted.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over the past decade the Asia-Pacific region has experienced tremendous changes in nearly every aspect. These changes have been particularly profound in the forestry sector, where society has dramatically increased its demands and expanded its expectations for goods and services. Almost all countries in the region have moved towards sustainable forest management at the policy level and in many countries institutional structures are also gradually changing. This report reviews the status and trends in forestry policy, legislation and institutions in 12 countries and outlines the extent to which changes in these areas have been effective in supporting transitions towards sustainable forest management. Trends in governance and efforts to tackle illegal logging are also assessed. The report highlights the need to develop consensus over the roles of forestry in national development as a fundamental pre-condition for improving forest management. Policy measures should promote economic growth balanced with resource conservation and poverty reduction. This involves clear and equitable allocation of rights and responsibilities, application of appropriate technology and environmental safeguards, and removal of disincentives for investment in forestry. Most of all, forestry institutions need to be flexible and responsive in capturing opportunities and striving to optimize the contribution of the forestry sector to emerging needs.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The Land Law of 2001 was a landmark statute intended to strengthen and protect the rights of ordinary Cambodian landholders. A land titling programme (LMAP) was initiated soon afterwards, with extensive World Bank and donor support. The land occupied by the community of Boeung Kak, in the heart of the capital was excluded from this process, despite evidence of prior residence going back decades. Instead it was classifi ed as having “unknown status” by the LMAP, as “state land” by default, and as a “development zone” by authorities. This paper highlights the failure of the LMAP programme to protect the rights of vulnerable people living on sought-after land. Instead residents’ insecurity has increased: while many have been forced to leave, more than 2,000 families still remain and are standing their ground under threat of forced eviction. The paper also describes the community’s action to bring a case to the World Bank Inspection Panel, demanding that the World Bank undo the damage caused to their community.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The presentation will highlight the importance of establishing knowledge and understanding about “gender mainstreaming” strategies and gender equality within the Cambodian Land Administration Sub Sector Program (LA-SSP) and the land policy. Gender oriented objectives of the LA-SSP comprise of sustainable improvement of the living conditions of the urban and rural population of Cambodia, especially for women. The urban and rural population, in particular women, should make use of the improved infrastructure and the extended scope for action to participate in socio-economic land development to a greater extent. Socially balanced and gender-equitable secure access to land should be improved in rural as well as in urban areas, according to a well-ordered utilisation of land. The legal framework for gender equality in land includes the Constitution from 1993, the Land Law from 2001, and Sub-decrees. 1 million land titles have been issued through systematic registration until 2009 to women and men – 20 % of these titles are done in the wife’s name, 70 % consist of joint titles. Lacking data and a missing “registration culture”, unregistered marriage, and intransparent subsequent land transactions prevent the monitoring and evaluation of gender equality in land administration. A huge gap can be observed between official law, plural legal regimes and general implementation practice. I will offer appropriate solutions for developing cadastral reforms that require an intimate knowledge of the existing conditions in the Cambodian land sector. Cadastral systems should serve all sectors of society and the majority of population. Hence, the State should act in utilitarian ways to give equal opportunities towards access to land via freehold, leasehold and family tenure that could be ensured by cooperatives and associations with optimized gender-oriented shareholder structure. Social land concessions should provide titles to landless and land poor female- headed households in an equitable selecting process for strengthened income generation and agricultural activities for women. According to the concept of utilitarian justice registration, cadastral systems, and formal and informal property regimes serve all sectors of society, in particular women. This has not been the case in Cambodia so far. There is a general agreement on the importance of educating women on their land rights and on the procedures and institutions of land administration and dispute resolution between family members, relatives, siblings and non-married spouses. However, local community action as a cornerstone for land administration involving males and females is still nascent.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan, Akha and Dai farmers, regarded in China as &quot;backward&quot;, passive recipients of state-led development, have been &quot;getting rich&quot; on rubber and expanding rubber cultivation into neighbouring Laos. State cash crop campaigns to raise minority farmers' incomes inadvertently turned minority farmers into dynamic entrepreneurs. This paper builds on Vinay Gidwani's use of development as a &quot;regime of value&quot; to raise social and economic value to analyze these unexpected results. Local state agents believe they are the agents of development, bringing modest social and economic improvements to minority farmers of obdurate backwardness. Minority farmers see themselves as improving their own incomes and &quot;quality&quot;, a term in China for social value, in an era when they are responsible for their own development. National development discourse encourages citizens to raise population quality by becoming entrepreneurial, a message heard by minority rubber farmers as well as urban elites. Through creative, post-Fordist production models and agile deployment of land, labour, and capital, minority farmers have achieved incomes that exceed those of workers on state rubber farms, large plantations whose Fordist production models are losing out in the uneven transition from a planned economy to a more capitalist market assemblage. Akha and Dai rubber farmers, the &quot;backward&quot; minorities on China's periphery, have unexpectedly become the forerunners of flexible production arrangements that are prevailing in the arena opened up by China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The purpose of this dissertation was to discover possible shortcomings in the land registration processes and to indentify minimal adjustments for a successful land registration initiative in Cambodia. The enjoyment of collective ownership from 1979 to 1989 witnessed the failure of this system and therefore the country signalized a need of a new property system. Consequently, Cambodia introduced land privatization in 1989 in which Cambodian citizens could have a right of ownership over residential land and a right of possession over agricultural land. The government simultaneously attempted to register all landholdings by issuing the Instruction on the Implementation of Land Use and Management Policy dated on June 3, 1989. More remarkably, Cambodia adopted two subsequent land laws in 1992 and 2001. The latter aims at providing full ownership rights for Cambodian citizens through a system of land registration. However, land registration has remained a serious work for the government. Methodologically, this research examined the transitions of the implementation of the land laws and legal regulations from the inception of land privatization in 1989. The research used materials and data from published sources such as NGOs and government agencies as bases for analytical input. The interview of the Chief of the Department of Land Registration under the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in Phnom Penh in December 2008 was another source of information to fulfill the analysis. Furthermore, this research looked on a comparative view of the success of Japanese land registration when the Meiji land tax reform started in 1873 as a tool for a proposed reform for Cambodian land system. The result of this research revealed that land registration system in Cambodia has remained unsuccessful. The centralized power to finalize land registration through sporadic land registration has made the system more convoluted, time-consuming and costly procedures thereby deterring landholders from participating in land registration. Moreover, the failure to introduce land taxation has shown that competent authorities do not have incentives to perform the duties. Resulting from such a failure, land tenure has remained uncertain thereby making more land grabbing and land disputes. Following the above findings, this research proposed several considerations. District authorities in cooperation with commune authorities should be the sole government agency to be responsible for sporadic land registration. Also, a law on land taxation should be urgently considered so that landholders are able to contribute their interest in land to the state. With regard to land taxes, the government in return is able to provide basic needs for social development. Amending necessary legal provisions of the 2001 Land Law and other relevant regulations in order to facilitate the implementation should also be necessarily taken into account.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">A group of legal scholars and professionals met in Phnom Penh in 2008 and talked of the need to organize an academic conference on the subject of comparative law. The informal dinner discussions later became a serious commitment. An organizing committee was formed to start elaborating on the topics and programs, soliciting financial and human resources for the conference. The conference was held successfully in Phnom Penh on March 14-15, 2009. It was attended by legal scholars and experts from inside and outside of Cambodia. At the end of the Conference, participants agreed to the initiative suggested by the organizing committee to launch a publication of the revised papers and to make efforts to organize regular discussions and concentrated research on the practices and methodologies of comparative law, particularly those suitable for the context of developing countries seeking to benefit from this globalizing trend. This Cambodian Yearbook of Comparative Legal Studies is the outcome of such commitments and efforts. Although the publication does not claim to possess the virtue of being able to contribute much to the existing knowledge and “mainstream” discussions about comparative law and legal theories, it works in the direction of expanding the vision, testing the adjustability and applicability of existing knowledge to parts of the world where empirical data and material for a possible new approach to comparative legal studies of the 21st century seems to exist amidst a serious academic vacuum.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM SUMMARY: One of the peculiarities of the Vietnamese land system is the existence of a ‘zero state’ with regard to land institutions: all the country’s existing land institutions were put in place in the last 25 to 30 years. However, this does not mean that there is no history of such bodies; indeed, those that are now emerging carry the traces of each past period. The many local customary institutions reflect the principles underpinning previous systems regulating the social and spatial distribution of resources, and elements of the French land tenure system can be seen in the decision to register land ownership certificates rather than follow the more Anglo Saxon system of using the titles themselves as proof of ownership. Nevertheless, there is a clear synchronic dimension to the process of putting land institutions in place, which is reflected in the role it has played in the profound transformation of the Vietnamese State and society</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In Cambodia, an increasing demand for land has accompanied rapid economic expansion over the past decade, leading to land tenure insecurity for many of the country's poor. Despite the adoption of a new land law in 2001 and the establishment of the Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP) in 2002, tenure problems have continued. The difficulties with land reform policy relate partly to LMAP's design problems and partly to poor execution. These difficulties are the result of both bureaucratic weakness and the implementation of land policy reform by a politicized and personalized bureaucracy characterized by patron-client relationships. While there is no quick fix to problems in the land sector, steps toward a solution should give top priority to resolving land claims in conflict-prone areas, encourage registration of all land transfers, incorporate the participation of residents in the development of solutions tailored to local settings, convince elites of the political utility of land reform, and include citizen empowerment on the reform agenda.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Access to land for smallholder farmers is a critical foundation for food security in Myanmar's uplands. Land tenure guarantees seem to be eroding and access to land becoming more difficult in some upland areas. If this trend continues it may have negative impacts for food security and undermine environmental and economic sustainability. This briefing paper explores the relationship between land tenure and food security, as well as key institutional and other factors that influence land access and tenure for smallholder farmers in the uplands today.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: The present study is a result of a three-month research stay and internship with the Lutheran World Federation Cambodia (LWF), in Kampong Chhnang Province. It deals with a land dispute that was closely monitored by LWF and that serves as an example for ways in which land disputes are dealt with in the rural Cambodia of today. Rather than exploring in detail the reasons, scale or consequences of the global land grab, competition over land and land conflicts in Cambodia, which would exceed the scope of this paper, I will try to outline the general framework in which land conflicts occur and evolve in Cambodia, focussing on the strategies and existing mechanisms used in trying to solve them. The objective is to present the chosen case study of a village in Kampong Chhnang Province involved in a land dispute from a victim‟s, as well as from an NGO‟s perspective and to highlight the accordance as well as differences between the two perspectives on this particular case and the approach in solving the conflict.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodia has a land area of 181 035 square kilometers and a population of almost 14 million people (2008). In 2008, about 82 percent of the households lived in rural areas. A large majority of these households engage in rice- based agriculture, collection of forest products and livestock production. The agricultural sector generates about 32 percent of the Gross Domestic Product and provides employment to about 80 percent of the country’s labour force. The sector is dominated by small farm households who are mainly engaged in subsistence production. Further, most of those employed in the agricultural sector are self-employed or unpaid family members working on the household farm. This National Gender Profile focuses on female and male headed agricultural households and their characteristics pertaining to their demographic and social profile, access to productive resources, livelihood activities and livelihood outcomes. The Gender Profile is based on data derived from the latest Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey in 2008 (CSES 2008). Due to small sample households used in the said survey, the indicators are presented at the zone level (i.e. Plain, Tonlé Sap, Coastal, and Plateau/ Mountain) This report is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the geographical features and gives brief agricultural information of Cambodia and introduction to CSES 2008; provides the rationale for a gender profile of the agricultural household, as well as an overview of the gender issues in the country and provides an overview of gender issues analysed in the report, introduction to the CSES, gender analysis framework of the country’s agricultural sector and key definitions used in the report. Chapter 2 presents data related to the demographic and social profile of the agricultural household and population such as age, household size, household labour force, marital status, ethnicity, literacy and education completed. Chapter 3 includes gender-based access to productive resources like agricultural labour, land, improved technologies, credit, and access to/ownership of selected durable goods. Chapter 4 focuses on livelihood activities such as crop production, livestock production, fishery, forestry, and non-agricultural business. Chapter 5 includes sex-disaggregated data on some selected livelihood outcomes. Last but not least, chapter 6 presents final conclusions.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since the 1980s, while trying to maintain political stability and territorial integrity, the Vietnamese state has strongly moved towards the transformation of a centrally-planned economy to a more market-oriented model, in which private, foreign and joint-venture businesses are increasingly becoming the key pillars of the national economy. Another key aspect of the Đổi Mới’s agenda was a fundamental shift in the party-state’s foreign relations policy toward a normalization of Vietnam ’s diplomatic and trading relations with China , the United States , and other countries since the early 1990s. Over twenty years after the Đổi Mới renewal renovation, Vietnam has been praised by various domestic and international institutions for its “impressive” achievements in socio-economic development and poverty reduction and for its gradual liberalization and market diversification, coupled with its commitment to equality. Consequently, this has changed the relationship between the party-state and society in a number of fields, including the control of agricultural land and other forms of natural resources. Such transition marks a great change in our scholarly understanding of Vietnam . This Occasional Paper will contribute useful elements for understanding the social, political and economic dimensions of contemporary rural Vietnam.</style>

The update gives more visibility to the CEDAW Committee’s Concluding Observations and, accordingly, also to the CSOs’ shadow reports feeding them. This inclusion offers a more critical and comprehensive, if preliminary, overview of the situation of rural women in selected countries.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Cambodian society remains largely agrarian, with land being the corner stone of the production system for a large majority of the population. To address a growing food demand of an increasing rural and urban population1, the agrarian systems are being transformed by the intensification of the livestock and cropping systems as well as by the territorial expansion onto the forest areas. The urbanization and industrialization of the economy are additionally becoming key drivers for the development of the country. All these intertwined processes are leading to dramatic land use changes within a more and more competitive environment of access to land. Cambodia has also embarked in a comprehensive “Decentralization and De-concentration” reform process aiming at a redistribution of power and functions from central to sub-national levels. Land and natural resources management planning is amongst the new prerogatives of elected councils at province, municipal, district and commune levels. Yet, the mechanisms and responsibilities for devolved spatial planning are yet to be translated into sound procedures and practices. The paper is aimed as a contribution to fill in this vacuum. Building on the debate about notions of scale and governance, the paper presents the institutional foundations of the spatial planning system that is being designed in Battambang province2, Cambodia3. It addresses some conceptual issues of scales to be considered in spatial planning. The overall planning approach and procedures are further discussed with specific reference on multi-stakeholders participation and spatial analysis using a combination of GIS-RS and perception-based mapping techniques. The paper reviews how the principle of countervailing influence is applied to produce a provincial spatial planning policy framework, district spatial master plans and legally-binding commune land use plans</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">On 1st of July 2009, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen signed the “Declaration of the Royal Government on Land Policy”. According to this document emphasis should be given to State reform, land law, and environmental law with their impacts on the use of non-renewable resources (land, water, and soil). The implementation of the Cambodian social land policy should start with the need to ensure access to land and to sustain rural development and environment for a modern, prosperous Cambodia. The legal framework for sustainable rural development and land policy includes the Constitution from 1993, and the Land Law from 2001, and Sub-Decrees. Land policy can be interpreted as a central element of property policy. Property is protected under the Constitution and the Land Law from 2001. State public property must be interpreted as the property of all Cambodian people, or as social land policy, that serves the purposes of humans living in the country as a public interest, particularly in rural areas. With a land use planning system the Cambodian planning authorities are able to guide and to restrict the use of land property to foster sustainable rural development. Social land policy needs a broader basis in Cambodia than at present State public property with the guarantee for private use, e.g. through land leasing and concessions, is absolutely sufficient, efficient and effective. Social land policy is an interdisciplinary approach of good governance, land and constitutional law, land economy, spatial planning, and gender issues. This policy can also be a state-driven concept for rural areas in other (developing) countries. It must be legally classified as a public interest so that the eternal ground rent, as the economic gain of the land use, is appropriated and then distributed to all Cambodians in equal shares.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land, and its proper management, is a central issue in developing countries. Efficient use and management of land are key contributors to maximizing the potential benefits of sustainable socioeconomic development. Accurate and accessible land information is a necessary requirement for sustainable rural and urban development, which will contribute to the elimination of poverty. A well-functioning land market is crucial for achieving these goals and a prerequisite for a land market to function properly includes easy, rapid and cost-effective access to land information. Although the Vietnam Land Law (2003) aims at facilitating the development of a land market, there are still impediments to the growth of the land market due to a lack of access to land information. Consequently, land information users depend on personal contacts or approach land sellers through informal means. Therefore, enhancing access to land information is of high priority as land information is fundamental to decision-making on land investment and management. Although the promulgation of these land management laws and regulations is considered significant and substantial progress in improving access to land information, there is a lack of systematic empirical evidence as to how well the transparency provisions of the legal framework on land management in Vietnam have been implemented in practice. Against this background, this report is prepared to document the actual disclosure of land information as required by the laws and regulations.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM SUMMARY: A bitter land struggle is unfolding in northern Burma’s remote Hugawng Valley. Farmers that have been living for generations in the valley are defying one of the country’s most powerful tycoons as his company establishes massive mono-crop plantations in what happens to be the world’s largest tiger reserve. The Hukawng Valley Tiger Reserve in Kachin State was declared by the Myanmar* Government in 2001 with the support of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society. In 2004 the reserve’s designation was expanded to include the entire valley of 21,890 square kilometers (8,452 square miles), making it the largest tiger reserve in the world. Today a 200,000 acre mono-crop plantation project is making a mockery of the reserve’s protected status. Fleets of tractors, backhoes, and bulldozers rip up forests, raze bamboo groves and fl atten existing small farms. Signboards that mark animal corridors and “no hunting zones” stand out starkly against a now barren landscape; they are all that is left of conservation efforts. Application of chemical fertilizers and herbicides together with the daily toil of over two thousand imported workers are transforming the area into huge tapioca, sugar cane, and jatropha plantations. In 2006 Senior General Than Shwe, Burma’s ruling despot, granted the Rangoon-based Yuzana Company license to develop this “agricultural development zone” in the tiger reserve. Yuzana Company is one of Burma’s largest businesses and is chaired by U Htay Myint, a prominent real estate tycoon who has close connections with the junta. Local villagers tending small scale farms in the valley since before it was declared a reserve have seen their crops destroyed and their lands confi scated. Confl icts between Yuzana Company employees, local authorities, and local residents have fl ared up and turned violent several times over the past few years, culminating with an attack on residents of Ban Kawk village in 2010. As of February 2010, 163 families had been forced into a relocation site where there is little water and few fi nished homes. Since then, through further threats and intimidation, others families have been forced to take “compensation funds” which are insuffi cient to begin a new life and leave them destitute. Despite the powerful interests behind the Yuzana project, villagers have been bravely standing up to protect their farmlands and livelihoods. They have sent numerous formal appeals to the authorities, conducted prayer ceremonies, tried to reclaim their fi elds, refused to move, and defended their homes.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Burma is situated in Southeastern Asia, bordering Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. The majority of its population lives in rural areas and depends on land as a primary means of livelihood. Because all land in Burma ultimately belongs to the state, citizens and organizations depend upon use-rights, but do not own land. Burma’s laws grant women equal rights in some respects and also recognize certain customary laws that provide women equal rights in relation to land. In practice, however, the rights of many women are governed by customs that do not afford them equal access to or control over land. Forcible and uncompensated land confiscation is a source of conflict and abuse in Burma, and protests and fear of “land grabs” have escalated as the state opens its markets to foreign investors and pursues policies to dramatically increase industrial agricultural production. Burma has rich water, forest and mineral resources. However, a rapid expansion of resource extraction efforts in the past three decades has led to widespread land and water pollution, deforestation and forced relocation.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM INTRODUCTION: This paper traces the implications of key agrarian transformations −particularly the reforms in land policy and emerging land relations− for livelihood security and vulnerability. Part of a broader societal transformation and globalization of economies, these new development trajectories include commercialization of farmers’ produce, contract farming, cooperative sector reform, rising landlessness and tenant farming, and the end of exclusive dependence on land for earning a living. The economic and property rights reforms in Vietnam have stimulated a diversification of rural income sources and the beginnings of an agricultural land market. These fundamental shifts in the nature of rural and peasant livelihoods and production relations are resulting in greater economic opportunities, but also marginalization and vulnerability for some regions and some rural residents.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Đổi Mới, the name given to the economic reforms initiated in 1986 in Vietnam, has renewed the party-state’s ambitious scheme of industrialization and has intensified the process of urbanization in Vietnam. A large area of land has been converted for these purposes, with various effects on both the state and so- ciety. This article sheds light on how land conversion has resulted in farmers’ re- sistance and in what way and to what extent it has transformed their livelihoods in the transitional context of contemporary Vietnam. The article argues that agri- cultural land use rights remain an important asset for Vietnamese farmers, con- taining great value and meaning for them besides forming a means of production and therefore a source of income. Because the contemporary land tenure system has not yet recognized an adequate level of private property in relation to land, agricultural land conversion often becomes a contested issue and has often disrupted farmers’ traditional livelihoods, forcing them to face insecure livelihood prospect.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This study examines the impact of current land policies in China and Vietnam on women's entitlement to land, women's wellbeing and gender power relations. The ethnographic study of one village in each of the two countries contextualizes women's lives in the kinship and marriage system in which power and gender relations are embedded. Current land policies, when implemented in the existing kinship and marriage system, make women's entitlement to land more vulnerable than men's, limit women's choices and weaken their power position. Variations in kinship rules in the two countries lead to different outcomes. In the Chinese village the dominance of patrilocal marriage and exogamous marriages limits women's access to land, whereas in the Vietnamese village the rigid concentration of inheritance to males puts women in a difficult position. The comparison between communities of rural China and Vietnam reveals the importance of considering gender and kinship when studying the implementation and impact of land policies.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround them—slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare. This book, essentially an “anarchist history,” is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of “internal colonialism.” This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott’s work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The transition to a market economy has sparked Vietnam's unprecedented urbanization and industrialization. In order to accommodate the spiraling land demand triggered by urban and economic growth, the Vietnamese government has been using the mechanism of compulsory acquisition at an astounding scale to convert massive amount of agricultural land to urban land for non-agricultural uses. A large number of the country's poorest, most vulnerable citizens have been forced out of their land to make way for development projects, yet, they are also the group that have least benefited from them. Compulsory acquisition has therefore been the fundamental cause of social conflicts. The growing public resistance against compulsory acquisition makes consolidating land the most difficult step in the housing development process, and one that is frequently beset with disputes and negotiation impasse, causing significant project delays. This thesis examines the dynamics behind the site clearance process for the 62-hectare Van Quan new urban area project, a state-led urban housing development project conducted by a state-owned developer, the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUD). Given the sizable scale of the project, it is expected that site clearance would be particularly long and arduous. Yet, HUD was able to complete land acquisition within 6 months. The thesis aims to understand why the Van Quan project had such a rapid site clearance process despite its scale and complexity. The findings reveal that structural conditions of the project and developer's own innovativeness were key factors shaping the auspicious land acquisition outcome. Moreover, contrary to the popular belief that state developers tend to resort to coercive measures in handling site clearance, HUD was actually rather accommodating towards farmers' demand. The thesis concludes by discussing two hypotheses that may explain this seemingly benevolent behavior of HUD as well as policy implications for implementing site clearance for other projects.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The research team set out to answer three research questions: 1) What are rubber investment’s key features with regard to the investment process, investor identity, location, activities and scale? 2) How was the “upland” landscape originally zoned and mapped as part of the LFA process, and later re-zoned and mapped by local authorities and foreign investors? 3) What are the impacts of rubber investment in upland areas on the land use and livelihoods of the villagers involved? In examining the zoning process, our objective is to put some specific details on a process that is often discussed in overly general terms: surveying. We show how three types of landscape classification – Land and Forest Allocation, investment project-specific surveying, and district-level zoning – have produced pictures of the upland landscape that differ by scale, spatial resolution (detail), category system, and legal status. We focus on surveying as a key transition point between provincial-level policy and individual projects because it is the process through which land categories that are used in policy debates (e.g., agricultural land) get put into practice. While Oudomxai lacks an industrial land use map, the incompleteness in zoning information is not due to an absence of mapping, but a difficulty in coordinating and integrating the mapping that has been done at different times. In turn, this has produced situations where, as elaborated in the Sino-Lao case study, investor surveys begin with little or no previously existing zoning information.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OVERVIEW: At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of Myanmar (MOAI), a joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM)) team visited the country from 5 October to 4 November 2008. The main objective of the Mission was to analyze the food supply situation for the forthcoming year at the national and subnational levels (particularly in Cyclone Nargis-affected areas) and estimate food and agricultural assistance needs. Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar on 2 and 3 May 2008, affecting the food security of approximately 2.4 million people in Ayeyarwady and Yangon Divisions, through damage to agricultural land, destruction of the livestock and fishery sectors and depletion of food markets. The Mission assessed the 2008 main-crop harvest, forecasted 2008/09 production of secondary crops, and estimated food aid requirements and agricultural assistance for the 2008/09 marketing year (November/October). This assessment also ascertained whether transport and marketing infrastructures have recovered from the disaster. The Mission team held meetings with relevant institutions, including Government, international agencies, donors, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. Available data and information on food security was also collected and reviewed from different sources. At the institutional level, interviews were conducted with leaders of agricultural research institutes; staff of the Myanmar Agriculture Service (MAS) of various states, districts, and villages; staff of the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD); staff of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MoLF); and staff of NGOs in the field. Field trips visited 11 out of 17 of the country’s states and divisions in all ecological zones of the country. The Mission team observed crop-growing conditions, analysed the key factors (such as rainfall, fertilizer, disease/insects, price, cost of production), and assessed the yields under various categories. Interviews were conducted with villagers (farmers, labourers, fisherman, etc.), rice/food traders, fertilizer traders, and millers. The interviews covering households and hospitals collected first-hand information on food consumption, nutrition and health, and coping strategies (remittances, non-agriculture activities, changes in food consumption and assistance by the Government, WFP, NGOs, etc.). In addition, telephone interviews were conducted with the government officials of townships/districts from both Delta and Chin State, that could not be visited by the Mission. The Mission had a briefing session with MoAI in Nay Pyi Daw, prior to the field trips and held debriefings with MoAI and MoLF in Nay Pyi Daw and NGOs in Yangon, prior to its departure.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This BMZ comissioned report by GTZ highlights the dramatic increase of land concessions and rising inequality in land distribution in Cambodia. Parts of the study refer to an earlier report by Uch Sophas “Foreign Direct Investment in Land for Biomass Production in Cambodia”. The South-East Asian country Cambodia has an area of 181,035 km2. The Government of Cambodia is adapting its activities to attract FDI, which has lead to a steady increase especially since 2007. Hence, during the last several years landlenssness has risen to 20% and less thean 40% of the farmers are left with less than 0,5 ha, i.e. less than half of the minimum area required to meet nutritional needs. ﻿Inequality of land ownership is increaseing throughout the country. Officially almost 1 million ha of land were granted Economic Land Concessions (ELC), constituting roughly 5,5% of the Cambodian territory. In 36 out of 59 cases, foreign businesses are involved. Though a legal framework with defined steps for concession application exists, often the procedures do not comply with the regulations.</style>

The Lao PDR is a small land-locked country in South-East Asia with a total area of 236,800 m2 with over 80% mountainous surface. It is estimated that all together concessoins for 2-3 million hectar land were granted, representing 13% of Lao PDR's total land area.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper aims at exploring the local background of and solutions to the forest conflict in upland areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, who are called hill tribes, in northern Thailand. A so-called hill tribe problem has been officially identified as a result of the slash-and-burn cultivation and other perceived problems, such as opium poppy cultivation, illegal immigration, and the suspicion of disloyalty to the state. This has created distrust and tension between the groups and authorities. The local conflict has recently been related to the dilemma of conserving the forest from all human interference, while many people live and make their livelihood within and adjacent to the protected areas. Furthermore, as the results imply, strictly protected areas and reforestation have also increased the competition over land and natural resources and, thereby, the likelihood of local conflicts. The scarcity and pollution of water, illegal logging, and poor fire control have contributed to the conflicts between local communities. The conflicts between the local communities and officials have been nourished by political and public discussions. Using definitions and terms with negative connotations and ignoring the heterogeneity between the groups or labeling some groups as malevolent have increased distrust and strengthened existing stereotypical images. Conflict resolution starts with efforts toward better mutual understanding, and changes in structures and attitudes are necessary. Local cooperation, utilization of traditional methods, and local institutions are central to conflict solving.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">INTRODUCTION: The following report has been compiled to bring to the attention of a wider audience many of the problems facing the people of Burma, especially its many ethnic nationalities. For many outside observers, Burma’s problems are confined simply to the ongoing incarceration of Nobel Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s democratically elected leader, and many other political prisoners. However, as we hope to show in the following report, this is only one of very many human rights abuses that provide obstacles to the people’s hope for democracy. This report concentrates in 3 specific areas of the country – Arakan State, Mon State and the Pa-O Area of southern Shan State. This is partly due to budget and time constraints, but, primarily because the brutal treatment received by the people of these areas at the hands of the military junta has received limited media attention in the past.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This document is prepared as an Annex to the Parallel Report and focuses on land and housing rights issues. Violations of housing and land rights are widely viewed as the major human rights concern in Cambodia. This document is intended to assist the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) in its review of Cambodia during its 42nd Session, 4 to 22 May 2009. The document was prepared for the purpose of providing recommendations to the State party and other actors as well as facilitating civil society input into this procedure. A number of organisations were involved in the preparation of this Annex, including Borderlands, Bridges Across Borders Southeast Asia (BABSEA), Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO), Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE), Community Legal Education Center (CLEC), Housing Rights Task Force (HRTF), Sahmakum Teang Tnaut (STT) and the NGO Forum on Cambodia. In addition, the recommendations in this report were developed following consultations with broader civil society groups including networks of community activists. The document focuses in particular on the right to adequate housing in Cambodia, as well as related human rights concerns. Matters addressed include (i) forced evictions; (ii) gaps in the legislative and policy framework on evictions, and a lack of implementation of existing laws and regulations; (iii) the absence of legal security of tenure for many households and obstacles to accessing title; (iv) concerns regarding the donor funded titling system: LMAP and LASSP; (v) land disputes and concerns regarding the efficacy, independence and transparency of dispute resolution bodies; (vi) displacement and other adverse impacts resulting from economic land concessions and mining; (vii) concerns regarding land rights of indigenous peoples; and (viii) the persecution of housing rights defenders.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This study attempts to understand the impact of economic land concessions for agro-industrial production promoted by the government. This promotion heavily impacts on the locals’ livelihoods and obstructs decentralized natural resource management, especially in natural forest resources. They also examined locals’ response to such a development scheme. The study found that in regard to “economic growth”, the state has very strong control over natural resources and people. Further, as a post-war nation, the state commits to developing its economy by gathering involvement from different stakeholders, including international donors, development agencies, NGOs, and local people in the development process. Yet privatization of natural resources such as land, forestry, fishery, mining and so forth can be also found in the Kingdom in favor of a globalizing economy. After the first general election in 1993, the Cambodian government has been committed to reducing poverty by taking multiple approaches. In terms of economic liberalization, Cambodia has been integrated into the regional and global economies. This approach offers a good opportunity to international trade, resulting in an increased demand for resource utilities such as forest, land, water, fishery and mining. With high demand of these resources and lack of effective regulations and managerial mechanisms, the multiple users take an opportunity to exploit at a massive level. Yet land and forest resources, which are essentially important to the locals’ livelihoods,have been privatized for the purpose of large-scale agricultural development, known as economic land concessions for commercial tree plantations. The privatization of forestland too often does not have any local consultation on the negative impacts on local communities and natural environments, leading to spark conflicts between private companies and local people. This study took place in O Tanoeung village, Kratie province, Northeastern Cambodia. To understand the context, documentary research was done, and various research methods were applied to gather primary data such as key informant interview, focus group, participant observation and household survey. The data were categorized and interpreted in the frame of the concepts of state power in natural resource management as enforcement, local community participation in resource management, and local’s response as a livelihood strategy. The critical analysis was based on the interpretation of livelihood activities and the perspectives of the locals, and the local complexity. Paddy rice fields, forest products and grasslands are the most important sources for the O Tanoeung villagers’ livelihoods. The villagers attempted to set up a community forestry system in order to respond to declining natural resources in the community and to sustain their livelihoods. The idea of natural forest protection was initiated by the locals in the CDP and recognized by the local and provincial authorities. However, it was ignored by the central government. Yet the government granted the forestland sought as a community forest to the private company. As farmland is most important for their life, it became the center of motivation to protest against the company. Although the farmlands were prevented from encroachment, the locals are not satisfied as they are concerned about the lack of land for their next generation and no space for raising cattle, and losing their natural resource-based livelihoods. Thus, they keep resisting through “silent actions” such as refusing to work for the company, secretly entering the concession area to hunt or collect forest products, and wishing that bad things happen to the company. In this sense, the locals not only reject participation in such a development scheme, but they also see this scheme as the biggest obstacle to their future lives. Besides seeing this scheme in a passive way, the locals consider that the government left them behind, and they are very much concerned with their future lives.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM INTRODUCTION: Since đổi mới, Vietnam witnesses a rapid urbanization and industrialization, which leads to conversions of a large area of agricultural land and other types of land, and this has forced thousands of farmer households to change their traditional livelihoods and even their lives. Using the lens of a sustainable livelihoods framework, this study analyzes and explains the questions of how, in what ways and to what extent agricultural land conversions have been affecting farmer livelihoods in one peri-urban Hanoi village. I argue that the state’s appropriation of agricultural land use rights have created essential socio-economic impacts on the farmers whose agricultural land have been appropriated for purposes of industrialization and urbanization. In coping with the new situation, while the party-state’s policy on vocational training and job creation shows limited impacts, many farmers in my case study rely on their natural capital in the form of residential land use rights to not only escape poverty but also to shift to new strategies of livelihoods. However, this transformation process consists of social differentiation and diversification of livelihood strategies among farmer households in the community, and more importantly, although having temporarily attained higher living standards, many farmers still feel their livelihoods are not sustainable because they lack work.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE CONCLUSION: The absence of secure tenure and resulting forced evictions represent clear violations of Article 11 of the Covenant with respect to the right to adequate housing by the Cambodian Government. The absence of a comprehensive legislative framework and the failure of other mechanisms to guarantee tenure security, including an independent and effective court system, constitute a failure of the Government to fulfil its Covenant obligations. The arbitrary and often violent evictions that occur in the absence of suitable procedural protections such as genuine consultation, the provision of adequate compensation and the opportunity for legal remedies, constitute a violation of the immediate duty to prevent illegal forced evictions. Furthermore, the Government is failing in its obligation to protect against forced evictions by third parties, including private individuals and companies. The poor conditions at resettlement sites constitute a failure by the Government to fulfil minimum core obligations of the components of right to adequate housing for those subject to resettlement.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: There is little evidence... that ordinary Cambodians are benefiting from the mass confiscation of their land. On the contrary, those who are displaced are explicitly excluded from any benefits, and instead find themselves facing loss of income, poor health, lack of education and other dire consequences that are directly opposed to the government’s public commitment to development, expressed through targets such as the “Millennium Development Goals” (MDG). There is no sign of the Cambodian authorities slowing down the pace of land grabbing and forced evictions, usually committed in flagrant contravention of their own laws. Economic Land Concessions continue to be granted in unlawful secrecy, concealed from the public, and sometimes in sizes far exceeding the legal limit of 10,000 hectares.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Vietnamese land-tenure policy reforms were embedded into general economic reforms (Doi Moi), enabling the country’s transition toward a market economy. Since 1998, they were implemented incrementally together with complementary instruments such as agricultural market liberalization and new economic incentives. Major steps included disentangling socialist producer cooperatives and assigning land-use rights to its former members, developing and adapting a national legal framework (Land Law), and enhancing tenure security through gender-balanced inheritable land-use certificates. In addition to promoting individualized rights, successive reforms have contributed to accelerating the agricultural transformation process by encouraging perennial crop and agroforestry systems (and thus long-term leasehold), and allowing rural land rental and land sales markets to re-emerge. During the 1990s, combined reform efforts sped up agricultural growth and industrialization, thereby enhancing food security, and combating hunger and rural poverty. Individualized rights, liberalized product and input markets, and a new entrepreneurial spirit resulted in intensified irrigated rice production, agricultural diversification, and better food quality. Although reform achievements—accompanied by policy interventions such as export quotas—are tremendous in terms of improved nutritional status and rural livelihoods, more efficient farming and agrarian structures, more secure land investment, access to collateralized credit, and poverty reduction, some challenges to consolidate reforms exist. These challenges include addressing increased urban–rural and regional income disparities, landlessness resulting from emergency land sales, misuse of local elites’ power in land allocation, and endangered “commons” through land privatization.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper seeks to reconsider the contemporary relevance of the resource frontier, drawing on examples of nature's commodification and enclosure under way in the peripheral Southeast Asian country of Laos. Frontiers are conceived as relational zones of economy, nature and society; spaces of capitalist transition, where new forms of social property relations and systems of legality are rapidly established in response to market imperatives. Customary property rights on the resource frontier can be seized by powerful actors in crucial political moments, preparing the territorial stage for more intensive phases of resource commodity production and accumulation. Relational frontier space is understood through the work of geographers such as Doreen Massey, who views the production of space as 'constituted though the practices of engagement and the power-geometries of relations'. In Laos, a twenty-first century resource frontier is being driven by new corporate investments in natural resources, and a supporting array of land reform programmes. The paper focuses on both the material and representational aspects of the production of the resource frontier, through policy and discourse analysis, and village level research in Laos' Khammouane province. By rethinking a dualist and hierarchical-scaled imaginary of frontier places, both rural people and local ecologies are shown to be key actors, in a complex, relational reproduction of frontier zones. An emerging Lao spatial and political assemblage - a form of 'frontier-neoliberalism' - is shown as producing dramatic changes in socio-natural landscapes, as well as new patterns of marginalisation and livelihood insecurity for a vulnerable rural population.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Access to land empowered by law is a crucial issue for sustainable development of a modern, prosperous Cambodia where the social and ecological responsibilities are well developed and embedded in a State Land Management. The State is the main actor in the land sector and has to guarantee State public property which cannot be transformed into private property. Cambodia shows still a high rural poverty rate, land concentration and anarchy in illegal land possession, illegal claim of State land and protected areas as privately owned and unlawful logging. State Land Management in Cambodia must give an answer to these problems. It is an interdisciplinary approach of land policy, land law, land economy and planning law for the use and valuation of land properties (immovable properties). The legal framework for property includes the Constitution from 1993, the Land Law from 2001, and Sub-Decrees. Private property is protected under the Constitution and the Land Law. Only natural persons or legal entities of Khmer nationality shall have the rights to own land. Private property rights ensure “exclusive” interests of the property. The essential property form for State Land Management is State public property. This property must be interpreted in the future as the property of Cambodian people that serves all human beings in the country, as a public interest. Having a land use planning system in the future, the Cambodian planning authorities are able to guide and restrict the use of State public property in order to protect and promote the public interest. State Land Management needs a broader basis within the Constitution than today. One of the main purposes of public oriented and constitutionally justified land management is to ensure access to land to all Cambodian people for their private use. Private land use under conditions of tenure security is more efficient than State land use. But that does not automatically require private property. State public property with the guarantee for private use, e.g. through land leasing, is absolutely sustainable, sufficient, efficient and effective for Cambodia. StateLand Management in Cambodia must – as a future task - comprise constitutional law, land law, planning law, concessions and leasing on State land that cannot be transformed into private property. State Land Management can also be a State driven concept of Good Land Governance in other (developing) countries. The Constitution and the Land Law shall empower the Government to guarantee a market economy for all Cambodian people based on State public property that is not allowed to be sold to the people. It must be interpreted as a public interest in the future that the (eternal) ground rent as the economic gain of the land use is skimmed-off and, in the next step, is redistributed to all Cambodians in equal shares.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">As shown in this report, harassment of local activists in Cambodia, including defenders of the right to housing, is widespread. Cambodia’s rich and powerful are increasingly abusing the criminal justice system to silence communities standing up against land concessions or business deals affecting the land they live on or cultivate. Many poor and marginalized communities are living in fear of the institutions created to protect them, in particular the police and the courts. As forced evictions increase, public space for discussing them is shrinking. Rights Razed noted that around 150,000 Cambodians were at risk of eviction. This conservative estimate has since been widely quoted in the international media. For the most part, however, the individual experiences of those affected go unreported. This book is about the people behind those numbers. [This book] shows how people living in poverty are routinely excluded from decisions affecting them. So-called “development” often happens to their detriment and at their expense, rather than in consultation with them.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Natural resources are neither a blessing nor a curse; intrinsically they can neither positively nor negatively affect political and economic developments. Rather, the negative effects of natural resources are correlated with a country’s “structured contingency”: the existing political configuration through which the oil revenue is managed and spent. Cambodia’s political configuration is domi- nated by interlocking patron-client networks that require a leader to capture and maintain the loyalty of key sections of the politico-commercial elite by fulfilling theirmaterial aspirations through the distribution of perquisites. Under these con- ditions, corruption is widespread, the government institutions are unresponsive, and resources aremisallocated. Examining the existing political configuration and the precedent set by the forest and land sectors, this article argues that future oil revenue will likely be used partly for self-enrichment of the political elites and partly to promote political legitimacy of the ruling elites through the politics of gift giving and patronage. The situationwill likely have two significant impacts on Cambodia: (1) inequitable development and increased income inequality and (2) perpetuation of Cambodia’s hybrid democracy, preventing any further movement toward democratic consolidation.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Forests are extremely important to the people of Laos. They are the basis for the livelihoods of most of those living in rural areas, especially the poor and Laos’ large population of indigenous peoples. Forests are also an important source of government revenue, and Lao forests are being increasingly recognized for the high levels of biodiversity that they support, including many rare and endemic species. They also provide various crucial ecosystem services. However, there are serious doubts—including from within the Lao government—about the sustainability of the country’s forestry industry. There are also concerns about the legal status of much of the Lao timber harvested and traded. This study provides detailed information regarding the complex and interrelated factors associated with timber extraction and logging quotas, commercial rubber plantation development, and cross-border timber trade at the provincial and district levels in southern Laos. It begins by looking at the various links along the commodity chain, and how government officials—particularly forestry officials at the provincial and district levels—are able to personally benefit. The study covers the political economy of logging and the timber trade, as well as the different forms of patronage, clientalism, or illegal rent-seeking that affect the forest sector. Since the political dynamics shift from one type of logging quota to another, this issue is discussed in some detail.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This policy discussion brief outlines that smallholder rural land tenure security is critical for pro-poor economic development and national food security. The paper examines why land tenure security for small-holder farmers is important and in what ways it can contribute to reinvigorating rural economic growth, reducing poverty, tackling inequality, improving national food security, social stability, environmental sustainability and good governance. While secure land tenure does not always guarantee any of the above indicators, it is a key component in the process to achieve these goals. This brief draws on a global perspective and refers to regional-specific issues relevant to the present Myanmar context. It aims to inform the debate on land issues in Myanmar in relation to rural and macro-economic development which is at the forefront of the agenda set out by the President under the new Myanmar government. More specifically, it underpins the formal position of the FSWG/LCG in relation to land tenure, namely that: Smallholder land tenure security is a critical foundation for sustainable and equitable national economic development that supports socially and environmentally friendly land management practices</style>

The legal category of “waste land” has served to justify policies and laws that enable the State to reallocate landholdings from smallholder farmers to private investors.

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM INTRODUCTION: Lao PDR is the least densely populated country in Asia and has long been remote and isolated from the rest of the continent. This role has only recently begun to change. The geographic location of Laos between the booming economies of Thailand, Vietnam, and China has led to the perception of Laos as a potential crossroads of the tightly integrated GMS an organization promoting trade, tourism, and development between countries through which the Mekong River runs. However, this is a role it has been somewhat reluctant to accept. It has become clear that Laos is changing at a rapid pace even as the ramifications of such changes are not fully understood. Nevertheless, the country will continue to follow this path of development as long as it continues to yield economic growth. Yet what does such a path of development entail and how will it play out in the future? Thus far, the Lao government has conceived the development of the agricultural sector as a crucial part of the country’s overall economic development. For the government, this has meant a push to transform the agricultural sector from one that is based on production for subsistence to one that focuses on production for the market. While many of the crops already grown in Laos are marketable, this has also meant the introduction of new cash crops. Most prominent among these has been rubber due to soaring prices over the past few years as well as its potential for smallholder development. Although rubber development has the potential to fulfill promises of poverty alleviation and economic development, its rapid expansion has created a number of problems for farmers. As investment from Chinese companies in the form of growing contracts has spurred the growth of rubber by a majority of villages and farmers, problems have begun to abound. The wide variety of contractual types has had varying socioeconomic effects on farmers entering into them. A loose regulatory environment has allowed investors to use contracts to exploit the land and labor of poor farmers in order to produce rubber in a cheaper and less risky manner. This report examines how this has happened using both a secondary literature review and firsthand fieldwork data. The first section is a background of the historical-geographical development of rubber as a cash crop in northern Laos, examining its origins in China and its transnational transfer across the border to Laos. The second section outlines the methodological framework employed during the fieldwork and afterwards when analyzing the data. The third section, entitled “Geographies of Growth”, looks at spatial trends of rubber growth throughout the region over time. The fourth section makes up the body of the report. This section uses contractual types and the diversity between and within them as a lens of analysis. Through the different contractual and growing types issues of social relations between different actors and resulting socioeconomic effects can be understood. Section five concludes the paper by offering policy suggestions and recommendations to help mitigate negative effects on farmers.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper starts from the assumption that the process of reform is as important as the content of the reform. Many excellent land policies, laws and technical reforms have been developed, yet, in many cases, implementation has slipped, stalled or has even been reversed. The paper argues that an understanding of land issues and the reform process from a governance and political economy perspective offers insights that can not only improve the design of reforms, but can also offer tools to support implementation. The paper, jointly developed by staff of FAO and UN-HABITAT, represents another contribution to the broader effort to understand land governance. As a joint paper, it seeks to recognize that land issues cannot be arbitrarily separated into rural or urban sectors such distinctions create artificial boundaries, which can impede a more holistic approach to the concept and issues. Governance is the exercise of political, economic and administrative authority in the management of a countrys affairs at all levels. Governance is a neutral concept comprising the complex mechanisms, processes and institutions through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights and obligations, and mediate their differences.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE CONCLUSION: LMAP has had considerable success in several areas, including the number of titles adjudicated in rural areas, development of legal framework for land management and administration, and the increased institutional capacity of the Ministry of Land. Unfortunately these successes are overshadowed by an increase in landlessness, forced evictions, land-grabbing and widespread tenure insecurity in Cambodia. In large part this is the result of a persistent lack of political will to consistently implement the legal framework that LMAP has developed. This report has outlined the authoring organizations‟ main concerns regarding the development of Cambodia‟s land sector. It has done so through an examination of LMAP, which has been the primary focus of land sector development by the RGC and development partners. The report has aimed to offer constructive recommendations for increasing the ability of LMAP, and any successor to LMAP, to improve tenure security for those vulnerable to displacement or other land rights abuses.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This study discusses the innovation adoption of leading farmers and their problems and suggestions. A focus group discussion was conducted on leading farmers of the Tram Kak District, Takeo Province, Thailand, who first adopted the system of rice intensification (SRI). Findings showed that leading farmers observed the system of rice intensification (SRI) after attending the training course which was organized by Centre d Etude et de Developpement Agricole Cambodgien (CEDAC). They utilized their knowledge in fertilizer usage, and the advantages and disadvantages of chemical and organic fertilizers. In addition, the leading farmers adopted the SRI principles and practices, and they also shared knowledge, practices, and experiences to family members and other farmers both in and outside district by face-to-face, informal meeting, and group discussion methods. The rice paddy yield increased from the former average of 2 t/ha to 2.8 t/ha when farmers shifted to SRI. However, the problems that they encountered were: low soil fertility, labour shortage, lack of irrigation system, drainage and water sources, lack of organic fertilizer, natural disaster, lack of diseases and pest control knowledge. Farmers looked forward to obtaining the assistance of the government or the NGOs in addressing their problems.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Vietnam has become a hub for processing huge quantities of unlawfully-logged timber from across Indochina, threatening some of the last intact forests in the region, a major new report reveals. Much of the illegally-imported wood is made into furniture for export to consumer markets in Europe and the US. Undercover investigations by the UK-based Environmental Investiagtions Agency (EIA) and Indonesian NGO Telapak have revealed how Vietnam's booming economy and demand for cheap furniture in the West is driving rapid deforestation throughout the Mekong river region, particularly in neightbouring Laos.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Myanmar's agricultural economy has been under transition from a planned to a market system since the late 1980s and has experienced a substantial increase in production. However, little research is available on the impact of economic policies in this country on agricultural production decisions and rural incomes. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact using a micro dataset collected in 2001 and covering more than 500 households in eight villages with diverse agro-ecological environments. Regression analyses focusing on within-village variations in cropping patterns show that the acreage share under non-lucrative paddy crops was higher for farmers who were under tighter control of the local administration due to their political vulnerability. Simulation results based on the regression estimates show that the loss in rural incomes due to farmers being forced to grow too much paddy was not negligible.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">SUMMARY: In the last 30 years, the context of development in Cambodian has gone through dramatic changes. A succession of transitions characterised by a complete restructuring of institutional and socio-economic frameworks have resulted in a singular situation. Cambodian society remains largely agrarian with land being a major safety net for a large majority of the population who depend on natural resources in their livelihood. Nevertheless, in the context of an industrializing economy, land-based resources are under the pressure of competing driving forces. Aiming at sustainable development, a balance needs to be found between interests that are sometimes contradictory. In this context, the paper presents a spatial planning initiative that is being undertaken in a province of Cambodia. The paper first reviews the current institutional context underlying the initiative. Then it addresses the objectives and scope of the proposed spatial planning framework. It further details the methodology and key outputs of the planning processes. It concludes on the conditions that need to be met to put the spatial planning framework into action.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In Vietnam, forest devolution policies were implemented in the early 1990’s under which the government transferred management power over large areas of forested land previously controlled by the state forest enterprises or local authorities to local households. The government believes that implementing devolution policies would improve local livelihoods for the upland poor and stabilize forest conditions to increase forest cover. This paper examines some of the impacts of the devolution policies on the distribution of forestland and forest resources among villagers in two Dai villages in northern Vietnam. It shows that devolution policies are selective; they are careful economic and political calculations by and for the government. The government only transfers management power over the less important forests (e.g., “barren land”) to local households; whereas it still retains power over more important forests (e.g., forestland with remaining good standing). The policies strongly emphasize the importance of forest protection and do not give enough attention to local livelihoods and needs. This is one of the root causes igniting conflicts over forestland between local people and local state agencies. This paper shows that although devolution policies emphasize individual rights over the forest, the allocation of these rights to villagers often come with stringent management obligations that restrict the rights of villagers and their use of forestland. Furthermore, property rights given to local households under the devolution trends are not enough for them to secure benefits from the forest. At the local level, implementation of the devolution policies are strongly influenced by local power relations by way of local elite positioning themselves to direct almost all benefits form the policies into their pockets. Instead, benefits should reach local villagers and go beyond the initial property rights system established by the government through the implementation of the devolution policies. For example the policies should rather address access to political power, household labor availability, financial capital and customary assignment, among several others. This paper suggests that in order to understand the uplands in Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, we need to go beyond the notion of a property rights system and study other mechanisms that play roles in determining on-the-ground villager access to and control over resources.</style>

Th[is] chapter examines LFA from the decentralized forest management perspective. In particular, it examines the process by which the policy was implemented and considers whether it helped build sustainable forest management at the community level. [It] first reviews the history of LFA and the major actors involved. Second, it examines two types of allocation processes. One is undertaken by district authorities with funds from the provincial government; the other is supported by an international donor. The comparison highlights underlying problems of LFA in practice, particularly its constraints in building forest management institutions that attain the dual goals of incorporating local people’s needs and protecting the environment. District authorities such as the District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO), placed at the centre of LFA, are often ill equipped to pursue challenging goals because of their limited financial and human resources. The weakness of the institutional foundation means that violations cannot be prosecuted by law but instead are resolved through social and political relationships among the stakeholders. Through review of the allocation process, this chapter shows how the policy has placed local authorities, such as DAFO and village organizations, at the centre of forest management. The weak institutional capacity of DAFO to adapt resource management plans to local conditions and monitor their impacts, as well as the still-new notion of resource tenure among the members of local communities, inhibits LFA as a means of community-based resource management.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper examines the institutional changes in Vietnam's urban development that have emerged as the economy has been restructured in a deliberate national policy entitled Doi Moi. The main focus is on the issue of compensation in land acquisition. Data were collected from field reconnaissance surveys, key informant interviews and secondary sources. Findings revealed a clear move towards the establishment of private property rights on land use, illustrated by the changes associated with land law and the dynamic interplays among the main actors in this transition. The government's role in land acquisition has been minimised gradually. A coalition between the government and land developers was discernible in the case studies, often associated with a low compensation rate in land acquisition, which was proposed by the government in favour of the developers but at the expense of individual sitting tenants. At another level, the law enforcement behaviour of local authorities was shaped by considerations of possible rent-seeking and concerns about intervention from higher-level authorities. These attributes of the transitional institutions in urban development will remain in the foreseeable future if Vietnam continues its current Doi Moi policy for rapid economic growth.</style>

Land rights are an important issue in Vietnam, where agriculture accounts for nearly a quarter of gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of the workforce is engaged in agricultural activities. Agricultural land in Vietnam was decollectivized in 1988, and land-use rights were granted to households.We focus on the subsequent land law of 1993, which gave house- holds the right to inherit, transfer, exchange, lease, and mortgage their land- use rights. This was implemented by issuing land titles (or Land-Use Certif- icates as they are known in Vietnam) to all households. This law initiated an extensive land-titling program in Vietnam: by the year 2000, nearly 11 million land titles had been issued to rural households, making this one of the largest rural titling programs in the developing world, not only in scale but also in speed of implementation. To view this program in comparative perspective, 8.7 million land titles have been distributed in Thailand since the early 1980s and 1.87 million in Indonesia between 1996 and 2000 (SMERU Research Team 2002); the largest urban titling program, aimed at squatters in Peru, distributed 1.2 million titles (Field 2003). The economic consequences are thus of interest not only to Vietnam but also to other developing countries contemplating land-titling programs. Our study contributes to the literature on land titling in several distinctive ways. First, we study a large nationwide titling program rather than one restricted to certain areas or certain classes of people. This is in contrast to almost all the studies cited above. This means that our results include any potential general equilibrium effects of such titling programs. Second, our work focuses on the impact of granting new rights to land, including the rights to mortgage and trade, rather than a formalization of existing rights (as is the case in most programs aimed at squatters). Further, by looking at different outcomes, we are able to make inferences regarding which of these new rights was most effective. Third, our focus on the 1993 reform enables us to distinguish the effects of land titles from the incentive effects of de- collectivization. Our work is complementary with other studies of agrarian transition in Vietnam, such as Benjamin and Brandt (2004) and Ravallion and van deWalle (2003). However, the use of measures of land reform progress across provinces enables us to distinguish the incremental impact of the 1993 land law from the overall effect of economic growth during this period.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In this paper we address the often sterile and circular debates over relationships between poverty and deforestation. These debates revolve around questions of whether forest loss causes poverty or poverty contributes to forest encroachment, and questions of whether it is loss of access to forests or dependence on forest-based livelihoods that cause poverty. We suggest that a way beyond the impasse is to set such debates within the context of agrarian change. Livelihoods of those who live in or near forests depend considerably on a rapidly changing agriculture, yet agrarian contexts receive only background attention in popular, political and academic discourse over poverty and forests. Moreover, to the extent that agriculture is considered, little heed is paid to social, technical and economic change. We therefore address agriculture’s changing relationships with the wider economy, otherwise referred to as the agrarian transition, and with the natural resource base on which it depends. The paper draws on the experience of Thailand to illustrate our key argument, and more specifically addresses the situation on the resource periphery through a look at the agriculture-forest interface.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">China's economic rise and consequent demand for a reliable and steady supply of inexpensive natural resources have led to a rapid increase in Chinese foreign direct investment stretching all the way to Africa and Latin America. Southeast Asia's Mekong region is no exception to that trend. This policy brief highlights China's emerging role in finance and trade in three selected Mekong region countries (Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam). The focus is on investments in the agribusiness, hydropower and mining industries where Chinese companies and banks are steadily gaining influence in the region.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: This report shows how, contrary to Cambodia’s obligations under international human rights law, those affected by evictions have had no opportunity for genuine participation and consultation beforehand. Information on planned evictions and on resettlement packages has often been incomplete and inaccurate, undermining the right to information of those affected. Lack of access to timely, relevant and accurate information undermines the right of people to participate in decisions which affect the exercise of their human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing. Lack of adequate notice before an eviction, also deprives affected communities of their right to challenge the order, and as appropriate to seek legal redress. In instances where there has been the appearance of consultation with affected communities, decisions on eviction and relocation appear in reality to have been taken by the authorities prior to these consultations, frustrating the right of affected people to propose alternatives and for those to be duly considered. In this report, Amnesty International is calling on the Cambodian government to abide by its obligations under international human rights law to give those affected by eviction an opportunity for genuine participation and consultation.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Although Cambodia has made significant progress in improving human well-being, poverty in rural areas persists. This Human Development Report for Cambodia assesses the state of rural livelihoods and their relationship with natural resources. It describes the status of human development at the regional and provincial levels, and distinguishes high performance areas from those which require more attention. Several key problems are identified, including: widening inequality in incomes and opportunities; persistent rural poverty; unacceptably high maternal mortality, or death during childbirth; high rates of child malnutrition; poverty compelling children to leave school at an early age; land inequality pose serious challenges to ordinary people’s livelihoods. The report delves into policy recommendations and opportunities to galvanise rural areas. It emphasises that the highest benefits are likely to be generated from targeted efforts in the following areas: fair and effective governance of land; a substantial increase of public investments in agricultural productivity; broadened and diversified job-creating sources of growth in both rural and urban areas; substantial investments in human capabilities; ensuring a ‘resource blessing’ from offshore oil and gas.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE SUMMARY: The impact of land titles on social and economic development and poverty reduction in the rural sector can be optimized by targeting land-titling efforts in areas where government agencies, NGOs, and private investors are actively engaged. The benefits for disadvantaged households can also be increased by policies that specifically link land-titling efforts to pro-poor development objectives. In this sense, active consultation and collaboration among all development actors in support of LMAP’s efforts would enhance the benefits from land titles for all landholders. The research methodology employed in the baseline survey has been quasi-experimental in nature using quantitative data collected in household interviews with a structured, close-ended survey instrument (See Annex A). The follow up survey should incorporate qualitative research approaches and tools into the overall methodology in order to provide more substance and texture to the household survey data, as many of the subtle yet important nuances concerning the economic and social impacts of land titles cannot be effectively captured by a standard household survey instrument.</style>

It examines the views of different parties towards the question on how land should be owned, managed, used, by whom, for whose benefits, and uncovers as well as explains the resulting conflicts over land rights in the Red River Delta since decollectivisation. It postulates that the contending views among parties over decision-making, distribution, and holding of land rights, create dynamics for conflicts, which take place under the form of public resistance, in a number of communities.</style>

Available at: http://www.journals.cambridge;org/abstract_S0022463407000069 [Accessed November 30, 2014]; Research-bas: This article builds on the author’s PhD thesis. The article itself draws mainly on existing Vietnamese and English language based literature. The article references fieldwork carried out in 2002 and 2007, but it does not go into detail in the nature of this fieldwork.; AccessToJustice-rel: Corrupt administration of compensation and levels of compensation far below the market value of land has led to unrest. Demonstrations have confronted local authorities but have tended not to achieve outcomes favourable to those being dispossessed;ZZZ;ZZZ;Conversion-FoodSecurity-rel: Some figures suggest a conversion of agricultural land at a rate of approximately one percent of the total per annum. This land is among the most productive rice and intensive market gardening land available in Vietnam;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: There are no official, reliable figures on the number of farmers dispossessed through the process of land conversion. However, various sources suggest that the numbers are in the hundreds of thousands of families, especially in areas close to urban centres. These also happen to be the more productive agricultural lands. Compensation is often corruptly administered, so that livelihoods are not properly compensated;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;Formalisation-titling-rel: Although land was allocated to farmers and other individuals through the “red book” system following the 1993 Land Law, this does not give security of tenure if the state considers that it is in the public/national interest to convert land to other uses. Land can be reallocated in the name of national development;ZZZ;MigrationLabour-rel: In principle, private and state users of appropriated land are supposed to assist dispossessed farmers to retrain for non-agricultural livelihoods and to employ the dispossessed in the economic activity for which land has been resumed. In practice, the extent of retraining has been very patchy, and few of those employed have come directly from the agricultural area affected by the new land uses;Overall-rel: This article provides a useful overview of the hottest land issue in Vietnam, which is the conversion of agricultural land to urban, industrial and other non-agricultural uses. This process involves the appropriation of land from smallholders through one of two means: state seizure in the case of land required for national security, public or collective purposes; and transfer of land use rights to private entrepreneurs where the new proposed use is deemed important for economic development. In the first case, compensation is determined by the foregone productive value of the land rather than its market value or intangible value in terms of security of livelihood. In the second case, local authorities often mediate negotiation of compensation. Compensation is often seen as inadequate or corruptly administered, and this is the main source of resistance and sometimes confrontational and even violent disputes in Vietnam. Training programs for farmers displaced from agricultural opportunities have not succeeded in reaching the majority of those displaced;Policy-law-rel: Land conversion and the associated transfer of rights from farmers to state or private sector users is a result of Vietnam’s Doi moi renovation policy toward outward-oriented market-based production. It is backed up by the continuing principles of ownership (by the people as a collective entity), management (by the state) and use (by individuals) under the constitution and under the 1993 and 2003 [and again 2013] land laws. Institutional approaches to dealing with land appropriation includes local Centres for Land Seizure and Compensation that are supposed to mediate the process in a fair manner;</style>

This land is among the most productive rice and intensive market gardening land available in Vietnam;Dispossession-grabbing-rel: There are no official, reliable figures on the number of farmers dispossessed through the process of land conversion. However, various sources suggest that the numbers are in the hundreds of thousands of families, especially in areas close to urban centres. These also happen to be the more productive agricultural lands. Compensation is often corruptly administered, so that livelihoods are not properly compensated;ZZZ;ZZZ;ZZZ;Formalisation-titling-rel: Although land was allocated to farmers and other individuals through the “red book” system following the 1993 Land Law, this does not give security of tenure if the state considers that it is in the public/national interest to convert land to other uses. Land can be reallocated in the name of national development;ZZZ;MigrationLabour-rel: In principle, private and state users of appropriated land are supposed to assist dispossessed farmers to retrain for non-agricultural livelihoods and to employ the dispossessed in the economic activity for which land has been resumed. In practice, the extent of retraining has been very patchy, and few of those employed have come directly from the agricultural area affected by the new land uses;Overall-rel: This article provides a useful overview of the hottest land issue in Vietnam, which is the conversion of agricultural land to urban, industrial and other non-agricultural uses. This process involves the appropriation of land from smallholders through one of two means: state seizure in the case of land required for national security, public or collective purposes; and transfer of land use rights to private entrepreneurs where the new proposed use is deemed important for economic development. In the first case, compensation is determined by the foregone productive value of the land rather than its market value or intangible value in terms of security of livelihood. In the second case, local authorities often mediate negotiation of compensation. Compensation is often seen as inadequate or corruptly administered, and this is the main source of resistance and sometimes confrontational and even violent disputes in Vietnam. Training programs for farmers displaced from agricultural opportunities have not succeeded in reaching the majority of those displaced;Policy-law-rel: Land conversion and the associated transfer of rights from farmers to state or private sector users is a result of Vietnam’s Doi moi renovation policy toward outward-oriented market-based production. It is backed up by the continuing principles of ownership (by the people as a collective entity), management (by the state) and use (by individuals) under the constitution and under the 1993 and 2003 [and again 2013] land laws. Institutional approaches to dealing with land appropriation includes local Centres for Land Seizure and Compensation that are supposed to mediate the process in a fair manner;</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over 943,069 hectares of land in rural Cambodia have been granted to private companies as economic land concessions, for the development of agro-industrial plantations. Thirty-six of these 59 concessions have been granted in favour of foreign business interests or prominent political and business figures. These statistics exclude smaller economic land concessions granted at the provincial level, for which information on numbers and ownership has not been disclosed. Since 1996, successive Special Representatives of the Secretary-General for human rights in Cambodia have expressed concern about the impact of economic land concessions on the human rights and livelihoods of rural communities. The concerns raised over the past decade remain the same today. At the root of these concerns is poor enforcement of and compliance with the requirements of the Land Law and Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions, which govern the grant and management of economic land concessions. Essential pre-conditions to the grant of concessions, such as the registration of land as state private land and conduct of public consultations and environmental and social impact assessments, have not been met. Likewise, restrictions on the size and ownership of economic land concessions have not been properly enforced. Individuals have used different companies to acquire interests in multiple concessions, contrary to the Land Law, and to obtain adjacent concessions for the same purposes, circumventing the 10,000 hectare size limit. Concessions have been granted over forested areas and former forest concessions, contrary to the Forestry Law and forestry regulations. Despite these breaches of the law, there has been no systematic review of concessions, as required by the Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions. Further, the judicial system has failed to uphold the rights of affected communities and respect for the law, and to hold companies accountable for their actions. As a result, economic land concessions continue to impact negatively upon the human rights and livelihoods of rural communities, who depend upon land and forest resources for their survival. Commonly-cited concerns are encroachment on agricultural and grazing land, and loss of livelihoods; encroachment on forested areas and loss of access to non-timber forest products; impact on areas of cultural and spiritual significance; displacement; and environmental destruction. The report raises particular concerns about the impact of economic land and other concessions on indigenous communities, whose rights to collective ownership of land are protected under Cambodian law. The alienation of indigenous land through the grant of concessions is undermining the ability of indigenous communities to register their collective ownership of traditional lands, and enforce their rights to land under the Land Law. Instead of promoting rural development and poverty reduction, economic land concessions have compromised the rights and livelihoods of rural communities in Cambodia. To promote the equitable and sustainable management of Cambodia’s land and natural resources for the benefit of all Cambodians, the Special Representative has made a series of recommendations relating to the implementation of the Land Law and Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions; protection and implementation of indigenous rights to land; access to information on all economic land concessions and beneficiaries of these concessions; and legal enforcement and access to an effective remedy for affected communities. It is also recommended that alternative agricultural models be considered, prioritizing smallholder agriculture and community-based initiatives. The recommendations are set out in full at the end of the report.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land fragmentation, where a single farm has a number of parcels of land, is a common feature of agriculture in many countries, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, land fragmentation is common, especially in the north. For the whole country, there are about 75 million parcels of land, an average of seven to eight plots per farm household. Such fragmentation can be seen to have negative and positive benefits for farm households and the community generally. Comparative statics analysis and analysis of survey data have led to the conclusion that small-sized farms are likely to be more fragmented, and that fragmentation had a negative impact on crop productivity and increased family labour use and other money expenses. Policies which allow the appropriate opportunity cost of labour to be reflected at the farm level may provide appropriate incentives to trigger farm size change and land consolidation. Policies which tip the benefits in favour of fewer and larger plots, such as strong and effective research and development, an active extension system and strong administrative management, may also lead to land consolidation.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The paper documents how the implementation of the land tenure policy of the Vietnamese government has affected the agricultural system, livelihood strategies and food self-sufficiency of Thai farmers in a remote upland village, Que, in Nghe An Province, North Central Vietnam. It is shown that the enforcement of restrictions on the area under swidden agriculture has resulted in a strong reduction of swidden agriculture production and shortened fallow periods, not compensated for by the slow increase in paddy rice production. It is suggested that while the changes imposed on land use certainly lead to an increase in forest cover, it is likely that the shortened fallow cycle on the land allocated to swiddening will lead to declining yields and replacement of forest fallow by bush and grass fallow, and thus to decreases in labour productivity. It is discussed whether there are options open to farmers for changing their portfolio of income generating activities in order to maintain and improve food self-sufficiency, income and living conditions. Finally, new trends in Vietnamese land tenure policy are outlined, and their possible implications discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Under the development paradigm of ‘Economic Concessions’ increasingly large areas of Cambodia’s land have been given over to establishing fast-wood plantations in recent years. Whilst proponents have argued that plantations are necessary for Cambodia’s economic development, opponents have argued that overall the rural poor do not benefit and that, in addition, there are numerous other negative social impacts and environmental consequences. Many economic concessions are at an early stage of development in Cambodia, and therefore it is important to objectively evaluate whether ‘economic concessions’ are an appropriate approach that can achieve equitable and just development in Cambodia. This report presents the results of field-research conducted by the Environmental Forum Core Team between September 2004 and April 2005 in four economic concessions, namely: Green Rich Co. Ltd, Koh Kong province; Cambodia Haining Group Co., Kampong Speu province; Pheapimex Co. Ltd, Pursat and Kampong Chhnang provinces; and Wuzhishan LS Group, Mondulkiri province. A fifth field trip was conducted in Prey Veng and Svay Rieng Provinces where communities grow some fast growing trees to supplement their income and access to natural resources. Field-based research is based mainly on interviews with local community members (n=283). Desk-based research is also presented that identifies international experience of fast-wood plantations, and significant trends and recent events in Cambodia’s fast-wood plantation development process. The aim of this research is to determine the likely benefits and disadvantages of economic concession development on local people’s livelihoods. It is our hope that this report will seriously contribute to policy discussions on whether economic concessions can make a significant contribution to pro-poor development. It also raises the question as to whether an alternative development approach is needed which responds much more readily to village-level needs and livelihood strategies and the relationship between villagers and their surrounding environment. Given the government’s current commitment to the establishment of economic concessions, the report makes a number of recommendations on how to ameliorate their more negative environmental and social impacts. These recommendations may be found in the Recommendations sections of the Executive Summary, in both English and Khmer.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">SUMMARY: Deforestation has become an issue of increasing concern in many tropical countries. In Vietnam, the response of policymakers has been embodied in several policies and programs, including land classification, land use rights devolution and reforestation schemes. Understanding how these state initiatives have affected the farmer’s land use decisions is essential to further guide policymakers in developing national planning strategies. Stemming from the study of three villages in the Northern Uplands of Vietnam, we analyze the course of actions and decisions that have taken place between policy implementation and documented reforestation. We use a qualitative approach that focuses on the role of institutions, which has not hitherto been utilized in the context of land use change in Vietnam. A revised version of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, coupled with a historical perspective, provides the basis for analyzing the relative influence of policies on the behavior of farmers. Our results indicate that, in the study area, policies have impacted on land use change, but not in the way that was planned by policymakers. The decision of farmers to cease cultivation of annual crops was neither the result of the government ban on upland cultivation nor the result of reforestation incentives. Instead, policies disrupted local land use practices and particularly collective rules governing land management, which ultimately led farmers to stop cultivating. Discussions held with farmers suggest that a majority of them do not consider tree plantations as a viable option. It is, thus, likely that reforestation in the area will only be a temporary phenomenon and not a sustainable process as intended by policymakers. Findings show that one should be extremely cautious when analyzing macroscale factors to explain human-induced environmental change, when final decisions on natural resources management are taken at the individual and community level. Only a micro-level analysis could explain the behavior of farmers by capturing the local factors that were prominent drivers for land use change. Other lessons learned, such as the importance of locating individual behavior within the larger context of a community system, can be applied to further policy development and research on land management.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper explores the geopolitics surrounding the &quot;modernization&quot; of the formal property rights regime in land in Thailand (formerly Siam) from the mid 1850s to the late 1930s. The paper argues that this weak, peripheral state, in pursuit of international recognition of territorial and jurisdictional sovereignty, employed a strategy of &quot;counter-spatialization&quot; in order to mitigate or deny claims for control over natural resources and population groups by imperial powers. The intertextual dimensions of this &quot;spatial&quot; mode of resistance are elucidated through a close reading of the ways in which diplomatic negotiations of a series of unequal treaties, beginning with the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1855, shaped-and were shaped by-the formulation and implementation of regulations governing formal property rights in land in Siam. The political economy of land rights at the large scale (local implementation of land titling) and the medium scale (enactment of national land laws) was nested within a process of geopolitical contestation over land rights at the small scale (international recognition of Siamese territorial sovereignty).</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This ADI study in collaboration with the Land Information Centre seeks to understand the relationship between land titling and poverty reduction in two sangkat of Prey Nup District, Sihanoukville Municipality. More specifically, it attempts to document the manner of landholder acquisition and the land titling process of the Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP) in four villages of the two sangkat; to examine land sales and land transfer processes before and after titling; to explore the link between land titles and access to credit; and to assess the contribution of land titles to security of land tenure and the resolution of land disputes. A survey questionnaire was conducted with 264 households in four villages of the two sangkat. In addition key informant interviews were convened with villagers, LMAP officials, and district managers of lending institutions. In the two sangkat villagers actively participated in the mapping and measurement of their lands for titling under LMAP and more than 90 percent of all agricultural plots owned by the households surveyed were titled under LMAP. This was a remarkable achievement. Land sales in the two sangkat were higher in the four and a half years since LMAP implementation than in the previous fourteen years combined. While higher land values benefited village sellers, proceeds from land sales were spent mainly on health costs and rarely invested in productive pursuits. Meanwhile, the majority of land sales after LMAP were still transacted by making sales contracts with notification at village and commune levels without processing the transfers through the Land Registry. This practice of transferring land extralegally threatened to undermine the viability of the systematic land titling program. Of note, more than 90 percent of all households surveyed had never used an LMAP title as collateral for a loan. A major benefit conferred through LMAP was the stronger tenure security on LMAP titled lands. While LMAP titling did not immediately translate into poverty reduction for most of the recipients it did constitute a contributing component of development interventions and reforms with potential for moving people out of poverty and allowing them to share more equitably in economic growth.</style>

Land Titling and Poverty Reduction: A Study of Two Sangkat in Prey Nup District, Sihanoukville Municipality; Research-bas: The study was conducted in mid-2007 and involved both quantitative and qualitative methods. 264 households were surveyed across two communes in Prey Nup District of Sihanoukville. The households selected had all received title to at least one plot of land. Focus groups and key informant interviews supplemented the survey to gain an understanding of land transactions prior to and following land titling.; Formalisation-titling-rel: LMAP achieved success at Prey Nup in terms of basic procedure. The rate of coverage was high. Land values increased, as did land transactions. The main rationale for land titling, however, seems to be unfounded. Access to credit and use of land proceeds for increased economic activity have not materialised. A disturbing finding was that land not titled in the area, in some cases because it was deemed to be under dispute, became more intensively disputed during the formalisation process. The case study of widow Srey Mom in Bek Krang village is an interesting case in point. In this case, titling triggered insecurity for poorer and less powerful households; Overall-rel: This study provides one of the more detailed pieces of research on the land titling process in Cambodia under the LMAP program. The paper sets out the rationale for land titling very clearly, and then reviews experience against this rationale. It finds that at one level, the program was successful in achieving a high rate of coverage within the project area at Prey Nup [which is one of the more successful irrigation areas in Cambodia]. It was also successful in raising land values in the area, increasing the assets of farmers. Having land title increased the security of tenure of landholders. On the other hand, the study found that the program failed to achieve wider development objectives. Most of the land transactions that occurred after titling continued to be done informally, without reference to the official land registry. Proceeds of the land sales were not considered by the study authors to be used “productively”, and were mainly to cover health-related expenditure [which also suggests that there may have been a significant element of distress-selling]. There was also little use of the land titles for credit access;ZZZ</style>

Conducted in 2004/05, the study revisited nine rural villages in which CDRI had conducted research in 2001, using quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the extent to which these villages and individual households had been able to move out of poverty and improve prosperity, or had experienced downward mobility and decline. The study set out to examine: which communities or groups move out of poverty and which remain trapped and why; whether people experience mobility differently in different economic conditions; how and why governance and social networks matter in mobility; what factors explain household and community progress and mobility or decline and stagnation; and the interaction between household and community factors, as well as any variations between villages and types of households.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper examines recent conflicts over freshwater fisheries in\nCambodia using the notion of accumulation through dispossession as a\nconceptual starting point. Despite a recent material turn, theoretical\nliterature on the political economy of the environment has only\npartially incorporated an ecologically nuanced view of nature into\nanalyses of its transformation under processes of capital accumulation.\nThe biophysical characteristics of riverine fisheries are predicated on\nthe ecohydrologic dynamics of water flows, and these characteristics\ndictate strategies of appropriation for both subsistence and commercial\nuse. The complexity of these material characteristics is compounded in\nthe case of Cambodian fisheries, where an array of state- and\nmarket-driven processes promote the dispossession of resources and\nconstrain the livelihood opportunities of rural communities dependent on\nfishing. Theories of capital accumulation and how accumulation induces\nsocioecological conflicts can be very useful, firstly, for explaining\nthe origins of environmental conflicts and, secondly, for grounding the\nanalysis of such conflicts in the politics of accumulation as mediated\nby state actors. Conversely, theoretical framings of primitive\naccumulation must examine the ``things{''} being accumulated (eg\nriverine fisheries) in far more biophysically specific ways, and must\nrecognize the circuitous pathways, particularly in cases involving\ndevelopmental states, that strategies of accumulation follow.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">SUMMARY: Despite a centralized political system, nation-wide legal reforms, and similar high housing demand pressures, property rights have evolved differently in Vietnam’s two leading cities Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during the transition period. Using ethnographic fieldwork and a hedonic price model, the study shows that the two land and housing markets price tenure ambiguity differently. The different price structures indicate the importance of norms, as socially constructed by local political interests and culture, in the efficacy of land title regularization programs.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Slow agricultural development has restrained economic growth and poverty alleviation in Cambodia. The country’s volatile history has left a legacy of weak tenure security and large areas of underutilized land. This study estimates the impact of access to land on poverty in a logistic regression framework using household survey data. Increased access to land is shown to significantly lower the risk of household poverty. Tenure security, land improvements and irrigation strengthens this effect. Simulations of the potential impact of a land reform package predicts a 16 percentage points fall in poverty incidence among landowning rural households and a 30-point fall when targeting the landless. The analysis suggests that improved tenure security should be at the top of the policy agenda. Given political and economic constraints, implementation of reforms remains a key challenge.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">TAKEN FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This report documents the contemporary ecological, social and economic transformations occurring in one village in Lao PDR’s central Khammouane province under multiple sources of development-induced displacement. Rural development policy in Laos is focused on promoting rapid rural modernisation, to be achieved through foreign direct investments in two key resource sectors: hydropower and plantations. Laos’ land reform program is also a key component of the changes underway in the countryside, as swidden (or shifting) upland cultivation is targeted for stabilisation and elimination. The village of Ban Pak Veng, in Hinboun District, is introduced as a village experiencing downstream effects from the Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC), a major inter-basin diversion hydropower project in Laos. The Mitigation and Compensation Program (MCP) of THPC as operationalised in Ban Pak Veng is documented and evaluated. Specific attention is given to downstream, wet-season flooding effects on the middle-to-lower Hinboun River, and the resultant post-2001 loss of wet rice production capability in Ban Pak Veng. THPC’s program to reconstruct rice paddy production capabilities in Ban Pak Veng through dry season agriculture are evaluated, and situated within the complex internal political situation in the village. This is followed by analysis of the effectiveness of THPC’s cash crop diversification and livelihood promotional program under the MCP. The report documents a series of disruptive ecological transformations linked to hydrological changes in the Hinboun River, which are negatively affecting villager livelihoods. These include effects on fisheries, riverside gardens, livestock and human health, and village housing. The volatile political situation in Ban Pak Veng is linked to the nature of the underlying livelihood vulnerabilities, not necessarily a “lack of leadership” in the village. The first major displacement affecting villagers - involving a significant displacement-induced transition pushing villagers from lowland paddy farming into upland swidden rice cultivation is outlined. A cascading set of linkages are described between the Nam Theun II inter-basin transfer hydropower project, the Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project at Nam Gnouang 8, and the THPC proposal for full resettlement of Ban Pak Veng in 2010. The second major section of this report completes the analysis of an ecological ‘double displacement’ effect underway in Pak Veng village. This second set of displacements is the result of a state-led land reform program linked to the concession-based plantation forestry operations of Oji-Laos Plantation Forestry Ltd. (LPFL). Through the land reform program, village degraded forests, which are crucial for village food security and swidden production, have been zoned for industrial plantation production and bulldozed. The nature of the trade-off to villager’s face is outlined. That is, between short-term rice sufficiency, and long term livelihoods into which villagers are forced. The Oji-LPFL program to pay cash compensation to villagers to cut down their own forests in return for cash income and access to productive swidden land is outlined, and the nature of the trade-offs for villagers are described. It is forwarded that, contrary to their public statements, neither THPC nor Oji-LPFL are currently meeting their obligations to account for the full extent of their environmental externalities upon vulnerable villagers in Hinboun District. The last section of this report follows this complex set of linkages between ecological degradation and village social-economy to its conclusion. The drivers and outcomes of cross-border migration of the majority of the young people from Ban Pak Veng into the illegal migrant labour market in Thailand are documented. Remittances from this migration however are having many implications for village life, as financial flows from village youth are in some cases being invested by their parents back into productive agricultural technologies, including smallholder rubber plantations. It is suggested that the multiple forces of ecological change, and trans-national enclosure of common property in Ban Pak Veng will rapidly transform the current system of common property rights in the village. Ultimately, a breakdown of common property rights to land and forests, and a steady decline in the natural resource base is likely. In its place may be a new regime of individual household and corporate-based accumulation, cash cropping and migrant labour. The future may bring some opportunities, but also, as a result of continued resource development in hydropower and industrial plantations, new and intensified sources of impoverishment and vulnerability for the people of Ban Pak Veng.</style>

Recent research work points to an increase of land conflicts in a range of areas however it has been difficult to monitor how conflict resolution activities are actually working because detailed information on the types and nature of land conflicts, their occurrence rates and resolution mechanisms applied was not available. The Lao-German Land Policy Development Project, which is making contributions to land policy development, considered it relevant and timely to analyse the present land conflict situation and conflict resolution in the Lao PDR.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper is part of a collection of five policy briefs was commissioned by the World Bank for the 2009 World Development Report Reshaping Economic Geography. Through relocation policies, the Government of Lao PDR seeks to transform what it considers to be a traditional, rural economy into a modernised market-oriented system by eradicating shifting cultivation, changing the way that land is allocated and by reaching communities. It intends for this to take place alongside providing improved access to roads, markets and government services and promoting new opportunities, including plantation based cash crop production ( Bechstedt et al. 2007). This policy brief focuses on these relocation policies and their apparent results. All five policy briefs seek to explore how a range of policy instruments might influence spatial differentiation within countries. The policy briefs explore different policy instruments and issues, but all have three common objectives. First, to explore the spatial disparity that motivated the policy response; second, to outline the policy instrument; and third, to examine the impact of the policy.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper examines the effects of forest devolution on the livelihoods of the rural poor. The paper analyzes changes in forest endowments and entitlements among households brought about by &quot;forestland allocation&quot; in two villages of Vietnam's Central Highlands. Its results indicate that not only the nature of devolved rights but also broader political and economic processes influence the extent and distribution of benefits. Even where devolution generates benefits to local people in poor areas, local power relations and the institutions regulating access to productive resources may constrain the ability of the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot; to take advantage of devolution. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Since the late 1980s, markets involving agricultural land have emerged in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. One major reason is that collective farms, previously a central feature of the country?s political economy, ended. And a major reason for that was villagers? everyday politics gnawed the underpinnings of the collectives until they collapsed. Rural households, for the most part, wanted to farm separately. Today they do. Land is not privatized, however. Farming households have land use rights, not ownership. This tempers markets, as do other conditions arising from contending schools of thought in Vietnam about how land should be used, distributed and regulated.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Increasing complexity and multidisciplinarity of water management has resulted in the development of broader approaches such as Integrated Water Resources Management IWRM). This paper discusses the IWRM and particularly its social and participatory dimensions based on the practical experience gained from the socio-economic analysis within a modelling project in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake. It is argued that water-related socio-economic analysis can significantly contribute to water modelling and impact analysis work because it helps to link modelling with the most relevant social and economic issues. This way modelling is also better able to answer to the needs of integrated water resources management.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land is the repository of memory and keeps traces of the past in the absence of a strong written tradition. It is perceived as an open book from which anyone can read and learn about local history: place names, old roads, legends and stories attached to places. For local people, bulldozing the landscape is seen as erasing their history, and disturbing social organisations and traditions.[1] In Cambodia--as in many other countries--land is an extremely important economic resource and asset. Land is livelihood. But equally, land is valued as an emblem of rootedness, belonging and stability, and is widely regarded as the very basis of social organisation in the country. In fact for most Cambodians, land is considered to be the foundation of society and life. A family's attachment to its piece of land has particular significance in a society that over the past hundred years has hurtled through successive periods of civil conflict, war, massive displacement, forced collectivisation and genocide, and finally into an unregulated, capitalist, market economy. Today, at least a third of Cambodia's peoples—rural and urban--are being systematically alienated from their lands, homes and livelihoods. In many instances communities are losing lands and access to natural resources because of economic and demographic pressures. But equally, people are being dispossessed from their lands by those with political power and money. This is made possible by a combination of factors: economic opportunism by the country's elites and their external allies and their impunity from legal action; ambiguous land laws; a judicial system that is hostage to political and financial power and unable to protect the rights of citizens; short-sighted economic development plans that seek to usher in private capital at any cost, and; shocking apathy by bilateral and multilateral donors and creditors, who are willing to turn a blind eye to massive land and resource thefts. This paper attempts to provide an overview of the growing crisis of land and resource alienation in Cambodia. The paper is based on secondary data, travel and observation in the Cambodian countryside, and personal interviews with representatives from rural communities, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and research organisations.</style>

The articles in this volume are unique in presenting a set of regional perspectives on this important issue. They demonstrate the importance of collection, recording and analysis of land tenure data in all regions. These data are crucial for improved decision and policy making in the fields of economic development, food security and environmental sustainabilitiy, owing to the variability and complexities of land tenure systems and arrangements; nor do land tenure databases permit standard solutions or models.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This participatory poverty assessment (PPA 2006) comprises one component of ADB’s Technical Assistance to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic for Institutional Strengthening for Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation. The goal of this PPA, as with the first PPA in 2000, is to complement the statistical analyses of poverty in a meaningful way and to record the experiences and concerns of the poor in order to initiate and identify more effective forms of public and private actions to alleviate poverty. To this end, the PPA has involved four main elements: (1) the combining of different forms of knowledge on poverty (cultural, anthropological, institutional, economic etc.,) and understanding the views of poor people so that these may be applied towards the goal of poverty reduction; (2) promoting an institutional process which ensures that the view “from below” is incorporated in an on-going fashion into the formulation and implementation of public policies; (3) recommending specific actions and; (4) consolidating the capacity for participatory research and process management that is needed to sustain all of these.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS: This article focuses not on the effects of corruption in Laos, on the Lao economy or the lives of individuals, but rather on what sustains it and makes it difficult to control, much less eradicate. In particular, it examines the political culture of corruption that has developed in the Lao PDR since its inauguration in 1975. It outlines the various forms of corruption that have arisen within the context of Lao pol- itical culture broadly conceived, discusses how and why corruption has become so deeply engrained, and examines why legal measures have been ineffective in dealing with corrup- tion. The conclusion takes account of the internal political and international strategic con- texts to suggest why pressures for reform are not more efficacious.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper conducts an empirical investigation of the rural credit market in Myanmar to help guide policy formulation on the microfinance operations in the country. Specifically, it looks into the determinants of credit demand and of rationing loans at the household level, and identifies the similarities, differences and relationships among the various segments of the rural creditmarket.Data are primarily gathered through a survey covering a total of 301 households among 7 villages in the Dry Zone. The results reveal the characteristics distinguishing the different types of credit sources, implying that the formal and semiformal credit are targeted towards different sets of clientele. The findings also suggest that promoting the semiformal credit sources likewise strengthens the development of formal credit sources.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This is a mixed methods study on the Cambodian Cadastral Commission (CC), a body set up in June 2002 to resolve disputes involving unregistered land. It was conducted by the Center for Advanced Study in collaboration with the World Bank Justice for the Poor Program, National Cadastral Commission Secretariat and the German Development Cooperation (GTZ). The study undertakes a review of the functioning of the CC and evaluates a new case management/incentive scheme which was being piloted with the support of GTZ. Data sources include (a) a survey of party satisfaction with the CC process, (b) an analysis of case files at district and provincial level offices of the CC; (c) semi-structured interviews with CC staff; and (d) qualitative case studies of land disputes before the CC. The study finds that the pilot did have a positive effect on the work of the CC but that it was poorly designed from an evaluation perspective and as such that it is difficult to quantify the impact. The report also includes recommendations for reforms which could enhance the extent to which the CC offers access to justice for the poor.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">It is important to maintain and protect a land-owner’s interests and rights in their allocated land to sustain production, market value and socio-economic improvement. This Land Administration project will ultimately improve and develop the human-to-land relationship in many areas, including socio-economic standards, legal principles relating to landowner rights and the development of further spatial data infrastructure in Vietnam. There is an ongoing need to regulate and control land use planning and land allocation in Vietnam Even though this process has been undertaken for many centuries there is paramount need to improve efficiency, practicality and sustainability. The Land Law 2003, is a promising piece of legislation towards developing Vietnam’s land market value and land use control, however there are still many issues yet to be fully addressed. Although the policies have been defined, the land registry network remains weak and distorted and in need of more intelligent administration and management. As sexual discrimination is unacceptable in any modern society, policy reform and further application is needed in this area as well. A further issue, but of no less priority, is the irregularity, outdated nature and incompleteness of the spatial system (map) that covers all areas of Vietnam. Our goal is to develop ongoing support both financially and intellectually for servicing an efficient land registry network, an updated cadastral system and legal assessment of critical socio-economic factors. This goal, once achieved, should develop a more positive community response to land administration, a willingness to adopt registration practices and awareness of socio-economic dilemmas such as gender equity. Vietnam is in an era of immense change in regard to its land administration processes, ultimately leading it towards a market-orientated economy situated in a Socialist environment – a conflict of interests the world has not yet seen succeed. For this reason, the global community must take a keen interest in supporting Vietnam’s progress for the sake of preventing a global mono-culture of administrations.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Vietnam Land Administration system has implemented successfully the land policy in recent decades. In the next phase of socio-economic development plan, land is requested to become important domestic resources for many investment projects. Obviously, land registration needs further development so that land use rights or land use right certificate can be used as asset in the open market. In the past ten years, many improved on land registration was undertaken. Many first-look problems have been identified and fixed. The issues of Vietnam land registration are more difficult to identify. This paper has objectives to contribute more in-depth of understanding on problems identification by analysis the registration system from two views: terminology and practice. Analysis on the terminology view allows identify the real intention of land policy that was hidden in the land legal documents. Analysis on the results of land registration progress for the whole country, for each of seven socio-economic regions, allows the current status of land registration in the reality.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">During processes of economic reform and transition, decision-makers are facing questions with potential far-reaching consequences, such as what institutions should be established, how to determine the relationship between state and market, and in what time frame and order. Against this background, this special issue has brought together four articles that analyze the type of institutional arrangements that emerge over time in relation to one of the basic means of production: land. The various contributions pay particular attention to an often-contested institutional development, the registration of land holdings. By proceeding with land titling under conditions of low socio-economic development, the state risks creating what is here termed as an &quot;empty institution&quot; rather than a &quot;credible institution.&quot; In other words, the new institution remains nothing more than a paper agreement or a hollow shell with little or even a negative effect on the actions of social actors. It is what might be called the &quot;collective trust&quot; in the system. As land becomes increasingly marketized and commodified, the state should ensure that the emerging land market does not result in a rapid concentration of land in the hands of a mighty few. This implies the control of market forces through the restriction or prohibition of land sales or land rental. In this context, effecting institutional change through land titling should be done with the utmost care.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Between 1970 and 1980 villages adjacent to the Dong Mun Uplands of Northeastern Thailand were transformed from subsistence communities, based on wet rice production, to a cash economy linked to global markets and the national and international political order. Although formally designated reserves had been created on old growth forests, the new economic opportunities encouraged conversion of forests to agriculture. Attracted by a false belief that land was being made available for settlement, immigrants flooded in and cleared forests to plant dryland cash crops using the newly expanded and improved road network to export their products. Social forestry programs may have assisted community development and encouraged agricultural diversification but were insufficient to prevent the contraction of forests, which now remain only as degraded remnants on the steepest slopes and least accessible sites. To some extent the social, political and economic forces have stabilized in Dong Mun and evidence of a new relationship between humans and their forest land is appearing. The Royal Forest Service is largely reconciled to the loss of domain over most of forest reserve and is pursuing a modified management policy that shows some evidence of a shift from an industrial to a post-industrial mode. In recent years, Buddhist monks in forest temples found through the uplands have achieved some effective forest conservation and restoration. Their efforts stem from the Buddhist precepts of the sanctity of all life and a view that forests are places for contemplation and spiritual renewal. Monks have been able to protect and restore some forest land because their views and wishes are far more likely to be honored than laws and demands of government officials. This reflects a broader phenomenon in Thailand where considerable impetus for a contemporary environmental movement has come from religious sources in contrast to the west where it is largely a secular in origin.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">According to the annual report of Huaphan Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (PAFO) (1999), despite land allocation, some villages are still practising shifting cultivation. To address this problem many decrees and regulations on land and land use have been developed and declared. The land allocation (LA) programme is one of these initiatives. So far, no effort has been made to evaluate whether the LA programme could facilitate change in land use and land management. The major objective of this study was to assess the impact of the LA programme on land use and land management.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This study focuses on the effect of land ownership on internal and international out-migration in Mexico and on internal out-migration in Thailand. Land can impact migration in four ways: as wealth; as employment; as an investment opportunity; and through inequality in ownership. Discrete time event history models of individual migration, using data from the Mexican Migration Project (covering Western Mexico) and data from the Nang Rong Project (covering one district in Northeast Thailand), show the effects of size of landholdings on internal out-migration of men. They also estimate the independent effects of relative deprivation in land ownership on migration. Results show that the size of landholdings has a negative effect on out-migration for smaller landholders (the majority of landholders). The size of landholdings has a positive effect on out-migration for larger landholders. Results suggest that the purchase and improvement of land are opportunities for investing the proceeds of migration.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACT The government of Laos has identified the eradication of poverty as a priority. Given the primarily agricultural character of the country, it has selected land reform as a core policy to reach this goal. The policy has two major aims: to increase land tenure security in order to encourage farmer involvement in intensive farming, and to eliminate slash-and-burn agriculture to protect the environment in a country still rich in forest resources. State intervention takes the form of land allocation, a process which combines the protection of some areas of village land with the formal recognition of private ownership in authorized farming areas. In a country with different types of geography, the effects of the policy are variable, but the research presented in this article demonstrates that the land laws have shortcomings which allow for differing interpretations depending on the local social relationships. Since local specificities are not taken into account, the reform is proving counter- productive for both forest protection and agricultural modernization, as well as having a negative social impact by marginalizing the poorest farmers.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In the 1980s, the Thai government legalized squatters living in public land by issuing certificates that allowed self-cultivation but restricted the sale and rental of the land. Using a differences-in-differences empirical strategy, we compare the differential rental rates between titled and untitled plots in reform and non-reform areas. We find that in reform areas households are more likely to lease titled plots and cultivate untitled plots because owners feared that untitled plots would also be expropriated if leased, although the restrictions only applied to plots with reform certificates. Using land rental rates and prices, we estimate that the rental rate of untitled land in reform areas includes a 4 percent premium due to expropriation risk. In other areas, however, land rights do not influence leasing decisions nor does a risk premium exist.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article focuses on the role of environmental movements that have an influence on state policies regarding community forestry in Thailand. It analyses how conflicts between the state and local people over the right to manage forest resources have ceased to be seen as isolated incidents, but as part of a structural shortcoming in Thai law. In so doing the article discusses the appearance of networks of actors who question the effectiveness of state control, and lobby for the establishment of formal frameworks to establish the rights of local people in regard to access to, and control over forest resources. The article analyses how the different actors became involved, and what their influence was in the process of drafting and presenting a peoples' version of a Community Forest Bill in 2000. In doing so, the paper pays special attention to a group in Thai society that has received little attention in the international literature. This group consists of academics and public intellectuals who have played an important role in the participatory process. Results show that conflicts over access rights to forest resources at the local level would not have had such a widespread national attention if it were not for this group who supported the idea of local management.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">As an important step forward, the Government of Vietnam issued Decree 200 in December 2004 to accelerate the reform of state forest enterprises. The government aims to develop provincial SFE reform plans by mid-2005 and to have them implemented over two to three years. However, the Government also recognizes that several implementation and policy issues remain. This review examines the overall policy framework of SFE reform in light of the promulgation of new regulations and existing implementation capacity. It highlights gaps to be bridged, with a view to maximizing positive impacts of the reform on growth, poverty reduction, and the environment. Decree 200 has the following objectives: (a) use land and forest resources more efficiently and sustainably; (b) enhance the business and production efficiency of state forest enterprises; and (c) improve economic and social opportunities in the locality of state forest enterprises. It is based on the principle of separating public interest from business activities.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The overall objectives of the study were to collect and analyse LUP methodologies in the 4 countries and to assess the experiences and lessons learned during implementation. The comparative assessment would include land use planning approaches at various levels, ranging from participatory village level LUP activities to the elaboration of land use master plans at provincial or even regional level. Finally, recommendations were to be formulated for the countries as well as for the sub-region as a whole. This study also tries to give some indications on how the AIFP/WSM component of the MRC could enhance land use planning practices in the countries of the sub-region. Due to the general concept of the component this would mainly involve support to training courses and events of regional exchange and some limited application of refined LUP approaches in selected pilot areas.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Contending Views and Conflicts over Land in the Red River Delta since Decollectivization is an anthropological study in which I offer a new approach exploring the viewpoints of various parties to analyze their attitudes, relations and conflicts over land in Vietnam's dynamic Red River delta after decollectivization. I also evaluate how and in what ways industrialization and modernization, as well as the effects of urbanization, marketization, and to a lesser extent globalization, have affected Red River Delta villagers' views and relations towards agricultural land. Drawing on various sources of data, especially ethnographic field research, I examine local responses to a number of essential land issues such as the process of agricultural decollectivization, programs for land use rights compensation, the politics of communal land management and use, and the problem of local cadre corruption in relation to land resources. My detailed descriptions and analyses of a number of land-based conflicts not only demonstrate the various meanings and values of land for the parties involved, but also show the complicated picture of attitudes, relations and conflicts over land. Moving beyond reflections of various existing theoretical perspectives on agrarian and peasant studies such as moral economy, political economy, socio-cultural dynamics, everyday politics and others, I present an overall argument of contending views as the dynamics for conflicts over land rights. More specifically, I argue that in the context of significant changes in the land tenure regime and related socio-economic programs in Vietnam, and under the effects of urbanization, marketization and globalization in the studied area since decollectivization, the meaning and value of agricultural land have increased to both villagers, the state and other parties. In such a dynamic context, diverse groups of ordinary villagers share some· common views that both agree and disagree with the view of some state institutions over decision-making, distribution, and holding of quyJn sa hitu [ownership rights], quyJn quim ly (management rights], and quyJn sit d1,mg [use rights] to agricultural land. The contending views toward such land rights have led a number of villagers to become involved in public resistance in land conflicts, and as a result, in the dynamics of land-based conflicts in a number of communities. These contending views and conflicts over land have affected the state in different ways, including changing state land tenure policy to accommodate the villagers' views and to resolve land-based conflicts.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The study describes the experiences of Kompong Phluk, a Khmer community that has been attempting to protect its flood forests and fishing grounds for the past fifty years. The authors examine how the community, assisted by the FAO project, has developed a resource management organization, formulated rules and regulations, sought government approval, and designed a comprehensive resource management plan. The report also details some of the challenges and issues that they have faced in the process. The report begins with a brief description of the history of the Tonle Sap, its biophysical setting, and traditional resource use practices, then discusses how the community has moved to formalize indigenous forest management systems by building on national policy reforms that are shifting authority for commercial fishing grounds around the Great Lake from private sector control to community management. This process of formalizing resource management systems is being facilitated through the FAO project. The steps involved in developing and operationalizing the formal management plan include meetings with stakeholders, participatory diagnostic assessments, analyses workshops, boundary demarcation, formulations of rules and regulations, management plan formulations, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. This report describes how these activities were implemented in Kompong Phluk, and their prospects for further extension around the Great Lake and Tonle Sap River.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE MISSION STATEMENT: The primary purpose of his mis,sion was for the Special Representative to update himself on the human rights situation in Cambodia for his report to the 61 st session of the Commission on Human Rights. He paid particular attention to the management of land and natural resources, the continuing problem of impunity, and to corruption which impacts negatively on the realisation of a range of human rights and distorts the allocation of economic resources so as to further exacerbate existing inequalities. He examined issues of justice sector reform, freedoms of association and assembly, indigenous land rights and issues relating to the proposed trials of senior Khmer Rouge leaders. He reiterated his call for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate the deplorable phenomenon of mob killings. He visited, in the company of representatives of the Governor, the former theatre &quot;Hamacheat&quot; in central Phnom Penh where over one hundred families live. He was shocked by the inhumane conditions he found. Mr. Leuprecht releases today a report on land concessions for economic purposes from a human rights perspective. In his foreword to the report, he states that the policies are wrong, that companies have been given rights over land that are very similar to ownership, and yet they have little or no regard for the welfare of the people, and contribute little to state revenue. The Special Representative is calling for full disclosure of information concerning all concessions in Cambodia, including economic concessions. The aim of the report is to contribute to better public understanding of the issues and to help bring about the changes in policy and practice that are necessary for the sake of Cambodia, its rural poor and for future generations</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">While Vietnam's reforms provided some of the weakest legal private property rights amongst the transitions countries, cities like Ho Chi Minh City have booming domestic real estate markets. Interestingly, while most properties in 2001 did not have legal title, those on the market did advertise a variety of property rights claims. Employing a hedonic price model to analyse the pattern of prices at which sellers offer properties in Ho Chi Minh City, this study examines how this market values property rights. The findings show that multiple forms of property rights, enforced by highly decentralized state institutions, are operational in this market. Furthermore, legal title itself is not the most valuable form of property right. These findings suggest that the value of property rights emanates from where it is enforced within the particular institutional context of a market.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS: This chapter examines three dimensions of inequality in access to land: inequality in access to land use, land output, and decision-making about land. By questioning the relationships between various parties, including among villagers, between villagers and local cadres, between village and commune institutions, and between villagers and the state at large, the chapter investigates in what ways and to what extent the current land tenure regime and the modernization and industrialization programmes have created inequality in access to land. Secondly, the chapter analyses the reactions of a number of villagers to the increasing inequality in land access in the villages of the northern delta.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The emergence of social and environmental movements against plantation forestry in Southeast Asia positions rural development against local displacement and environmental degradation. Multi-scaled NGO networks have been active in promoting the notion that rural people in Southeast Asia uniformly oppose plantation development. There are potential pitfalls in this heightened attention to resistance however, as it has often lapsed into essentialist notions of timeless indigenous agricultural practices, and unproblematic local allegiances to common property and conservation. An exclusive emphasis on resistance also offers little understanding of widespread smallholder participation in plantation production across the region. A useful method of approaching the complexity of local responses to plantation development is through the history of legal and informal resource tenure, within an analysis of rural political-economic restructuring. Drawing on research in Thailand and Sarawak, I suggest that a more nuanced appreciation of both the structural constraints and deployments of agency which characterise the enrolment of rural people into plantation commodity networks, opens up new spaces for analysis and political action, which supports a geographically embedded view of relations of power, rural livelihoods and environmental politics.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The legal framework for land use planning and land allocation (LUP/LA) in Lao PDR has been analysed based on the relevant laws (Land Law, Forest Law, Agricultural Law etc.). A national LUP/LA program under the overall responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been created in 1996. Until 2003, district agricultural and forestry staff have conducted LUP/LA activities in a total of 5400 villages in all provinces of Lao PDR. It is estimated that approximately 300.000 Temporary Land Use Certificates have been issued as a result of LUP/LA. The recent creation of the National Land Management Agency (NLMA) as a central agency in charge of all issues relating to land management and administration by merging the former DoNLUPAD, the Department of Lands and the housing and state land section of State Asset Department requires a review of tasks and responsibilities also with regard to the LUP/LA activities. In the past four years several authors and organisations have attempted to analyse the main impacts of the LUP/LA program on rural livelihoods and the environment. It is reported that in general, LUP/LA has been beneficial in the delineation of village boundaries and resource use zones, has helped to reduce land conflicts and improve forest protection. On the other hand, land allocation has lead to a reduction of agricultural and forest use area available to the households living in upland areas. In numerous cases this has resulted in decreased yields and insecure livelihoods. The results of this study confirm most of the impacts identified during previous surveys.</style>

Lowland immigrants are taking advantage of the vulnerable situation of indigenous people, and the absence of regulations, to lay claim to the people’s traditional lands. Illegal land transactions are taking place at an alarming rate without thought of the problems that would result from widespread landlessness among indigenous peoples or the impact this is likely to have on the remaining forested areas.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Thailand has experienced rapid deforestation especially since the 1960s. While large areas of forestlands were designated as national forest reserves, many forests were actually converted into farmlands. This article focuses on the institutional and administrative aspects of the national forest reserve system, the core institution of forest conservation in Thailand, and examines the institutional structure, historical process mostly since the 1960s, and procedures of the national forest reserve system and related policies at both in national and local levels. The national forest reserve system institutionally lacked sufficient mechanisms for enforcement and, because local people’s land use was not investigated in advance, the contradiction arose that large numbers of people resided and cultivated land in national forest reserves. While occasionally policies to give cultivation rights to these people were carried out, designation of national forest reserves continued without any structural amendments, and the contradiction was perpetuated. In the procedures of forest protection units, the sole organ for on-the-spot policing, breaches were sometimes overlooked in order to balance the regulations and actual situation of the local people’s livelihood. Forest officers are basically faithful to their tasks, even though they know the system itself substantially fails to function. But they also behave in realistic and flexible ways in applying principles that are far from appropriate to the actual situations they encounter. Institutionalization and activation of such an unrealistic system can also be interpreted as creating a wide range of discretion, which has enabled realistic forest conservation to be carried out as far as possible in the prevailing social or political climate without much friction. In order to argue for a suitable forest conservation system, this point must be taken into consideration.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Gender analysts of development have worked on land and property relations in poor rural areas for over two decades and the JAC 2003 special issue carried a range of work reflecting some of these research trajectories. This article is both a response to Bina Agarwal's paper on ‘Gender and Land Rights Revisited’, in which she reiterates her advocacy of land rights, and also an argument for why we should temper her transformatory expectations, recognize the complexity of what she sees as ‘social obstacles’ to women claiming land, and not rush to policy closure on land rights in all circumstances, or to blanket prescriptions. It argues for a renewed emphasis on reflexive ethnographic research with a focus on gender as social relations, on subject positions and subjectivities, on the meshing of shared and separate interests within households and on power residing in discourse as well as material assets.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The question of women's land rights has a relatively young history in India. This paper briefly traces that history before examining why gendering the land question remains critical, and what the new possibilities are for enhancing women's land access. Potentially, women can obtain land through the State, the family and the market. The paper explores the prospects and constraints linked to each, arguing that access through the family and the market deserve particular attention, since most arable land in India is privatized. On market access, the paper makes several departures from existing discussions by focusing on the advantages, especially for poor women, of working in groups to lease in or purchase land; using government credit for land rather than merely for micro–enterprises; and collectively managing purchased or leased in land, the collectivity being constituted with other women, rather than with family members. Such group functioning is shown to have several advantages over individual or family–based farming. This approach could also help revive land reform, community cooperation and joint farming in a radically new form, one centred on poor women.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The process of decollectivization in Vietnam, leading up to the 1993 Land Law, ensured farming households the rights to market their own produce and to transfer, exchange, lease, inherit, and mortgage their land-use rights. These changes imply a reworking of relations between state, market, and household, but also within households. Although the allocation of agricultural land in northern Vietnam was relatively equitable, allocation by the state represents only one channel of entitlements to land. The market represents a second, and customary or kinshipmediated channels, such as inheritance, are a third. This article examines the gendered dimensions of entitlements to land, particularly among female-headed households. While increasing attention is being directed to the nexus of gender and poverty and to the experiences of households headed by women, insufficient consideration is given to the diversity of female-headed households, and associated differences in livelihood vulnerability and entitlements to land. This gap is addressed through a case study in one village in northern Vietnam. The concluding discussion offers some directions concerning Vietnamese feminisms and decollectivization dynamics as agendas for future research.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACT: This paper examines the impact of a land reform in Viet Nam which gave households the power to exchange, transfer, lease, inherit and mortgage their land-use rights. We expect this change to increase the incentives as well as the ability to undertake long-term investments on the part of households. Our difference-in-differences estimation strategy takes advantage of the variation across provinces in the issuance of land-use certificates needed to enforce these rights. Our results indicate that the additional land rights led to significant increases in the share of total area devoted to multi-year crops, as well as some increase in irrigation investment. These effects are stronger in areas which felt the impact of the land reform earlier. ∗We</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article examines four different agricultural policies that have been implemented under the Burmese military regime, with particular reference to the varying reactions by rice farmers to the ways in which these agricultural programmes were implemented. The purpose is to challenge conventional studies of Burma/ Myanmar that focus on the behaviour and practices of the military elite in Rangoon, and treat the military regime as a unitary actor. By contrast, the state is disaggregated analytically into different levels (local, national), the object being how the varying interactions between the Burmese rice farmers and agricultural policy implementers result in correspondingly distinct farmer perceptions of the government. Existing scholarly debates on political legitimacy are considered, with particular regard to Third World authoritarian countries. This is followed by a brief analysis of four different agricultural policies that have been implemented under the military regime, together with Burmese farmers attitudes towards each of them. The way these policies are implemented is linked in turn to the popularity or unpopularity of the military elite in the capital and/or the local authorities in the provincial areas. Finally, the broader implications of the Burmese case study regarding the more complicated basis and status of political legitimacy are extended to other authoritarian regimes.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The term &quot;access&quot; is frequently used by property and natural resource analysts without adequate definition. In this paper we develop a concept of access and examine a broad set of factors that differentiate access from property. We define access as &quot;the ability to derive benefits from things,&quot; broadening from property's classical definition as &quot;the right to benefit from things.&quot; Access, following this definition, is more akin to &quot;a bundle of powers&quot; than to property's notion of a &quot;bundle of rights.&quot; This formulation includes a wider range of social relationships that constrain or enable benefits from resource use than property relations alone. Using this framing, we suggest a method of access analysis for identifying the constellations of means, relations, and processes that enable various actors to derive benefits from resources. Our intent is to enable scholars, planners, and policy makers to empirically,&quot;map&quot; dynamic processes and relationships of access.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Recent debates about governance, poverty and environmental sustainability have emphasized a ‘‘rights-based’’ approach, in which equitable development is strongly associated with individual and communal rights. This paper reviews this approach and explores its practical application to Thailand’s ‘‘Community Forestry Bill,’’ which seeks to establish communal rights of access and conservation in forest reserve areas. The paper examines conflicts concerning watershed forests and mangroves in Thailand, and argues that efforts to support rural livelihoods through community rights have been undermined by a state that has frequently supported commercial interests or opposed decentralization to minority groups. The paper documents how civil society organizations may negotiate rights within the wider public spheres in which rules, rights, and ‘‘community’’ are established, and defended.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">&quot;Logging in Muddy Waters&quot; analyzes the boom in forest exploitation that characterized the 1990s in Cambodia, focusing on the instrumentalization of disorder and violence as a mode of control of forest access and timber-trading channels. The article examines tensions existing between the aspirations of Cambodians for a better life, the power politics of elites, and the hope of some in the international community for a green and democratic peace. These tensions have produced both an interlocking pattern of &quot;illegal logging&quot; from the highest levels of the state to self-demobilized soldiers and peasants and sustained criticism that was only temporarily resolved through a legalization of the forest sector that benefited large-scale companies to the prejudice of the poor.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Corresponding to the characteristics of multi-discipline and multi-level management, land administration always requires and acquires spatial data at very different spatial and thematic resolution. This particularity leads to many problems in spatial data acquisition and data management such as: inconsistency and difficulty in exchanging data between data sources and application disciplines. There are many researches in the direction of multi-resolutions to solve above questions. However, the adequate solution only comes out when the multi-resolution characteristics are quantified for a certain application. This paper has the objectives to quantify the multi-resolution characteristics of spatial data in Vietnam land administration. This quantification bases on the analysis of function, role of each discipline and administrative management level for land administration system. To verify the use of the quantification results, a case study of generalization, acquisition of land use data between disciplines and management levels is carried out at a local level.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In the beginning of the 1990s, after a traumatic modern history of conflicts and genocides, the Kingdom of Cambodia, with the support of the international community, entered an era of relative peace. Cambodia is endowed with valuable natural resources and biodiversity. Over the past decade, however, economic development has relied primarily on the unsustainable exploitation of these resources. Current trends in the use of resources in forestry, fishery, and agricultural land are unsustainable. The central position of the article is that resource appropriation by the political, economic, and military elites has gradually excluded the majority of the population from the country's forests, fisheries, and arable areas. A common pattern of unsustainable extraction and inequitable access characterizes the exploitation of these resources. The article discusses policy implications for the government of Cambodia and the international donor community. Environmental reforms will face strong resistance from the elites, as institutional and social change may prove politically and economically onerous.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM INTRODUCTION: How have national and state governments the world over come to “own” huge expanses of territory under the rubric of “national forest,” “national parks”, or “wastelands”? The two contradictory statements in the above epigraph illustrate that not all colonial administrators agreed that forests should be taken away from local people and “protected” by the state. The assumption of state authority over forests is based on a relatively recent convergence of historical circumstances. These circumstances have enabled certain state authorities to supersede the rights, claims, and practices of people resident in what the world now calls “forests”.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to identify, scrutinise and comment upon the quality and adequacy of different existing large data sets (available from government ministries, international organisations, research institutions and so forth) that contain information on land use, tenure and related issues. It then analyses these data to establish linkages between standards of living/poverty and landholding. The reasons for undertaking this exercise are to explore what is available in terms of hard data on different tenural and socio-economic surveys of land in the country, assess their usefulness in understanding land-related issues, and suggest gaps that need to be filled in the future. The paper aims to collate existing data sets only, from which it draws inferences.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Land is the most important productive asset in agrarian societies such as Cambodia’s. Throughout Cambodian history, land ownership rights have varied with changes in government. In the period before French colonisation (pre-1863), when all land belonged to the sovereign, people were freely allowed to till unoccupied land and could cultivate as much as they liked. With French colonisation, a property-rights system was introduced in 1884. After Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953, a Western-style land ownership system continued until 1975, when the Khmer Rouge seized power and eliminated all private property rights. Land ownership rights were reintroduced in 1989, following the failure of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 and ten years of unsuccessful collectivised production. Within ten years of the reintroduction of private ownership and the redistribution of land, land issues have become one of the most sensitive economic, social, and political issues in Cambodia, demanding urgent solution. In the absence of comprehensive land-related data, this study extensively analyses secondary data and primary data from four large-scale surveys to better understand the magnitude of current land issues. Based on this analysis, it appears that most of Cambodians own at least some land, but only a small proportion of the population has official land titles. Over 70 to 80 percent of the total rural population possesses agricultural land acquired in different ways (government distribution, gifts from relatives/friends, purchase, or clearance of unused land), but only 1 percent has legal title to their land. The average size of agricultural holdings in Cambodia is quite small (only about 1 hectare per family) and distribution is highly unequal. Female-headed households generally have smaller holdings than male-headed households. About 40 to 50 percent of the landless and marginal landholders possess only about 10 to 15 percent of all agricultural land in rural areas. The estimated Gini coefficients of land concentration range from 0.47 to 0.66 for the different surveys that target different population groups. Even though only a very small proportion of the population has official title to their land, people have been actively transferring land (their only productive asset) on the market. Not only has private property changed hands, but also common property, such as forestry and fishery resources (state property), has been actively transferred to private use as concessions or for long-term investment. In the concluding chapter, the study draws some policy implications and proposes some suggestions for the improvement of future studies of land issues. The suggestions include questions to be answered in future research, as well as specific items to include in future survey questionnaires.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">&quot;The hour of capitalism's greatest triumph,&quot; writes Hernando de Soto, &quot;is, in the eyes of four-fifths of humanity, its hour of crisis.&quot; In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail? In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book will revolutionize our understanding of capital and point the way to a major transformation of the world economy.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The analysis of `ambiguous lands' and the people who inhabit them is most revealing for understanding environmental deterioration in Thailand. `Ambiguous lands' are those which are legally owned by the state, but are used and cultivated by local people. Land with an ambiguous property status attracts many different actors: villagers hungry for unoccupied arable lands in the frontiers; government departments looking for new project sites; and conservation agencies searching for new areas to be protected. This article shows, first, how two types of ambiguous land - state-owned but privately-cultivated land, and communal lands - were created. It then examines how the Karen, one of the hill peoples living on the ambiguous lands, have been struggling to survive between the forces of capitalistic development and forest conservation. Using a detailed study of forest use and dependency conducted in two Karen villages, I argue that the state's efforts to reduce the Karen's forest dependency, or even to evict them from the forests, are not leading to the stated objective of conservation. Finally, I draw some wider implications with reference to James Scott's thesis on state simplification.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Over the last decade, forests have played an important role in the transition from war to peace in Cambodia. Forest exploitation financed the continuation of war beyond the Cold War and regional dynamics, yet it also stimulated co-operation between conflicting parties. Timber represented a key stake in the rapacious transition from the (benign) socialism of the post-Khmer Rouge period to (exclusionary) capitalism, thereby becoming the most politicized resource of a reconstruction process that has failed to be either as green or as democratic as the international community had hoped. This article explores the social networks and power politics shaping forest exploitation, with the aim of casting light on the politics of transition. It also scrutinizes the unintended consequences of the international community's discourse of democracy, good governance, and sustainable development on forest access rights. The commodification of Cambodian forests is interpreted as a process of transforming nature into money through a political ecology of transition that legitimates an exclusionary form of capitalism.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Shifting cultivation continues as the economic mainstay of upland communities in many countries in Southeast Asia. However, the conditions that historically underpinned the sustainability of rotations with long fallows have largely vanished. The imperative to evolve more permanent forms of land use has been exacerbated by rapid population growth, gazette- ment of remnant wildlands into protected areas, and state policies to sedentarize agriculture and discourage the use of fallows and fire. There are many compelling examples where shifting cultivators have successfully managed local resources to solve local problems. Technical approaches to stabilizing and improving productivity of shifting cultivation systems have not been notably successful. Farmer rejection of researcher-driven solutions has led to greater recog- nition of farmer constraints. This experience underlined the need for participatory, on-farm research approaches to identify solutions. The challenge is to document and evaluate indige- nous strategies for intensification of shifting cultivation through a process of research and devel- opment. This process involves identification of promising indigenous practices, characterization of the practices, validation of the utility of the practice for other communities, extrapolation to other locations, verification with key farmers, and wide-scale extension.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Based on a review of the documents we have been able to collect so far, it appears that many Cambodian farmers are losing their land because of the combined effects of the market economy and the wholesale privatisation of what previously were commonly used resources such as forest and wetlands. For centuries the rural poor in Cambodia have been augmenting the insufficient income provided by the marginal and risky business of rain fed lowland rice production by foraging in the forests and fishing in the floodplains. Whilst the distribution of land in Cambodia still appears to be comparatively equitable, compared to elsewhere in the region, there are signs that consolidation is occurring at an alarming rate. More than 8 million hectares of Cambodia are now under long term forestry concessions, and 1 million hectares are now dedicated to commerdal fishing lots. With 3.3 million hectares under conservation management, 27 million hectares under cultivation and one million hectares taken up by towns and infrastructure, there is not much of the Cambodian commons left. Despite the vastness of public space already appropriated for private gain, some pubic officials still act as though there is still an abundance of public land under their control that is theirs to sell. During the course of preparation of this review, local Cambodian newspapers earned almost daily stories of court cases and protests by farmers dispossessed by officials and military officers who have misused their authority. Sales of public property for personal gain, including ministerial head offices, schools and lan within national parks were openly reported and unprosecuted. Our forthcoming inventory of cases and suite of in depth case studies will likely reveal more about the prevalence of the use of force and the abuse of power to expropriate the property the poor in Cambodia depend on for their survival. The current administration of land titling under the guise of the 'Land Law 1992' seems to be organised in such a way that the rural poor and other disadvantaged groups find that it is prohibitively expensive and dauntingly complicated to obtain certification of their land rigths. Some Cambodian elites appear to be exploiting this situation, by expropriating formally untitled property occupied by the vulnerable families and then abetting evictions to effect dispossesson of the occupants who have been targeted by speculators or developers. Our forthcoming review of land titling systems in Cambodia will try and identify remedies and strategies to end such practices.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE OVERVIEW: The goal of these four case studies is to document the different ways that poor people in Cambodia lose access to land. As individual case studies, they cannot show how frequent or widespread each mechanism of loss is; therefore they should be read in conjunction with the CLSP bibliographic review &quot;Where has all the land gone&quot; and the analysis of the CLSP land abuse database (forthcoming). However, it is hoped that describing in detail the different ways that poor people lose access to land will increase our understanding of how and why such loss occurs, and thereby provide a focus for advocacy, training, and policy discussion.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACT: Throughout Vietnam's long histoty, the central elite and peripheraI fanning communities have been legaIly and culturally divided. This dichotomy was never as complete as the famous injunction that &quot;the emperor' s writ stops at the village gate&quot; infers. InitiaIly, during the period of French colonisation and more recently since the introduction of doi moi (renovation) economic reforrns, central authorities have attempted to uni1Y land management with universaI normative law. This experiment has stimulated widespread non-compliance with land laws in urban centres; in sorne areas cornpliance is a fringe phenomenon. In this divided legaI geography, pockets of non-compliance give the appearance of autonorny from state legaIity-suggesting the existence of plural land law sub-systems. But an anaIysis of case studies concerning land use right applications, squatting, court· decisions and cornpulsoty acqnisition reveaIs complex relationships between land occupiers and the state. A myriad of fonnaI and relationaI connections blurs the interface between state and society, suggesting that the officiaI and unofficiaI aspects of land management are best understood as two components of the same system. Urban case studies suggest officiaIs and the public share a common culture that sustains relationaI networks binding state land management and local land practices. In this relationaI matrix, the legaI pluraIistic concept of 'non-state legaI sub-systems' is difficult to substantiate. Where relationaI networks are weak, such as between hill tribes and the central state, non-state legaI subsytems continue to flourish.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper argues that conflicts in the northern Thai highlands are a clear case of the politics of environmental discourse in the sense that conservation has played a role in lending legitimacy to both government agencies and ethnic communities in their struggle for the control of forest resources. Underlying such conflicts is the official line of negative thinking about ethnic minorities in the hills by associating them with various vices, namely as enemies of the forest, opium producers, and a threat to national security. The government agencies always cite ethnicity against a role in conservation, which keeps them from appreciating ethnic-specific knowledge in the management of the forest. Shifting cultivation has been distorted for having only a negative impact on the environment, disregarding the realities found in local practices which are varied, complex, adaptive, and quite dynamic in many cases. The ethnic minorities, on the other hand, keep raising the issues of community rights in relation to their role in the protection of the forest. Rarely are their voices recognized until serious conflict occurs, which can be seen particularly in cases of the eviction of minorities from conservation forests. Only recently have government agencies begun to show some positive concern over the social issues of rights, as seen in the official pilot project on community forestry and the drafting of the community forest act. However, there is still no serious discussion of legal recognition of minorities' rights to live in the forest.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">At a time when interest in the establishment of effective land administration systems in developing countries is running high, one of the best case studies is the Thailand Land Titling Project. This major project commenced in 1984 and has achieved substantial success. This paper describes the situation in Thailand at the time that the project had its genesis and traces the history from that point. The objectives of the project are outlined and the results of the project to date in meeting those objectives are described. In keeping with its purpose as a case study, the paper discusses the factors which have contributed to the success of the project and also the issues which have emerged and the lessons which have been learnt during the course of the project.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: This paper addresses the question of land rights and forest conservation for those on the periphery, i.e. the minority hill-dwelling population, specifically, the Karen. Over the past century, the hill-dwelling Karen in Thailand have transformed their subsistence agriculture from that based primarily on swidden cultivation in secondary forests on the lower hill slopes towards wet-rice cultivation in irrigated paddy fields. In either case, the Karen are in a no-win situation. Swidden agriculture in forested land (i.e., state land) can be condemned as an illegal practice, while their paddy fields are diminished in size. In this paper, then, I address the two-fold nature of the problem of hill forest and land for the Karen. First, I discuss land and forest use in the community, and the internally oriented discourse of communality. The Karen maintain a discourse of communality even as land rights within the community are becoming diversified and stratified. Second, I examine how the Karen resist government projects and claim their rights to livelihood based on forest land against the background of rising nationwide concern over environmental issues. The strategies for survival adopted by a minority ethnic group in a modern nation-state meet various external forces, some of which challenge, repress, and delimit these strategies while other adopt them for their own purposes or for a state common goal they share with the Karen. To begin, in the following section, I outline land and forest policies in Thailand as a background against which various discourses on the hill tribes in relation to forest have arisen.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Within the scope of this article, we would like to provide an overall picture of the achievements and shortcomings associated with the implementation of the forest land allocation policy. This analysis is based on a review of previous research and studies, and aims to understand to which extent objectives of the forest land allocation policy have been achieved so far and to explore the reasons why forest land is not available for plantation (to address the requirements for forest land for plantation for the current state-led reforestation campaign, Programme 661, and foreign investments). The article will investigate whether the forest land allocation policy itself has not been well developed in terms of its instruction and orientation, or whether it has not been implemented in a proper manner, and if so, how can we overcome the shortcomings? Should we continue to proceed with land allocation, if the existing land use values cannot be identified? If we continue land allocation, what mechanism(s) should we apply to ensure more effective and efficient forest land allocation? What theoretical solutions for land consolidation should also be recommended for piloting?</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM IIED WEBSITE INTRODUCTION: One of the outputs of a research project considering shifting cultivation in Thailand, Lao PDR and Vietnam. It considers the dynamics of shifting cultivation and alternative land use systems in the context of highland development in Thailand, gathered in order to provide up-to-date information to policymakers. The study includes examination of national policies relating to highland areas and the impacts of such policies on local communities and land use patterns. Detailed descriptions of what appeared to be more successful villages, in terms of sustainable land use, are included. The report concludes that there is now very little 'traditional' shifting cultivation practised in Thailand, and shows how communities are responding to new pressures affecting land use in the highlands.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper examines the social and political implications of deforestation and forest colonization in Thailand. After a brief history of forest colonization in the country, a study is made of the relationships between market economics and national development, and an assessment is made of the importance of these relationships for our understanding of the political ecology of Thailand. Detailed consideration is given to the emergence of land laws and their significance for colonization. The paper ends with a summary of the contrasting views of peasants, NGOs. and academics.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This article explores the nature of property rights systems, their evolution, and their effect on resource allocation. It is argued that certain institutional arrangements for land rights have evolved in order to reduce uncertainty and increase efficiency in credit as well as in land markets. Of particular relevance to developing countries, the article emphasizes the contribution of public sector infrastructure to effective land rights systems. An appendix to the article presents a formal model analyzing the effects of security of land rights on land prices, the intensity of cultivation, and the use of credit. Empirical evidence from Thailand supports several of the propositions derived from the model.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In recent years, rural Thailand has experienced rapid changes of which some have resulted from local processes such as land settlement and deforestation, while others are a consequence of processes affecting national economic and political development. This study is concerned in particular with the link between local change and incorporation in the wider system as experienced by 2 communities of Uthaithani Province. Within the incorporative aspect of development, key themes such as spontaneous land settlement and associated deforestation as an important backdrop for the lowland and upland settlements of the Central Plains, are addressed. Also considered are the changing control over local and wider societal resources, cooperation as an ideal in development programmes, participation which relates to the terms of incorporation as well as power, and changing locations as local communities become part of a wider society. An underlying set of dilemmas is identified and investigated: the difficulty of maintaining or increasing control over local resources on the part of the rural poor, while at the same time gaining access to wider societal resources as a basic aim of participatory rural development.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This paper proposes a framework for examining, locally, the problem of tropical deforestation and subsequent use of forest land. Through a case study of Thailand, the situation of forests, forest reserve, and forest land is examined. Problems and successes of rehabilitation of forest land are detailed. This provides a background against which to consider the problem of use and tenure of cleared land in terms of the political economy of resource use. Access to and control over local resources depends on the outcome of a complex set of relationships between local and non-local actors, including representatives of the state and diverse class interests.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Communist revolutions, which attempt to radically alter the total social structure of societies, usually move quickly to transform peasants into collective farmers. In this book, Grant Evans focuses on Laos to analyze peasant response to agricultural collectivization. Evans challenges fundamental assumptions held by communist governments and many Marxist anthropologists about human nature and peasant societies. He also provides the first major study of rural Laos since the communists came to power there in 1975. According to Evans, socialist leaders assume that traditional peasant societies display a range of cooperative institutions and an innately collaborative mentality that can be built upon to establish socialist institutions. However, in examining the confrontation between the modernizing socialist regime and the society of Lao peasants, Evans finds that the types of cooperation typical of the Laotian pre-revolutionary &quot;natural economy&quot; are in fact structurally inimical to the establishment of collective farming as visualized by the country's new leaders. Evans points out that one of the many paradoxes of communism's encounter with peasant society—especially a society as deeply embedded in the natural economy as the Lao peasantry—is that orthodox communist policies tend to entrench the natural economy rather than transform it. Frustrated by this unexpected outcome, the state tends to escalate its coercion of the peasants. Only if the communists abandon their long-held assumptions about the nature of both communist society and peasant society is this outcome avoidable. Evans suggests that some form of market socialism would be a more appropriate goal in that it would be more likely both to stimulate production and to attract support among the peasantry.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">This collection of fourteen essays presents a unique comparative analysis of agrarian change in the main rice-growing regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Its central theme is the interplay between agrarian relations and wider political-economic systems. By drawing on historical materials as well as intensive field research, the contributors show how local-level mechanisms of labor control and accumulation both reflect and alter larger political and economic forces. The key to understanding these connections lies in the structure and exercise of power at different levels of society. The approach developed in this volume grows out of a set of detailed local-level studies in regions that have experienced rapid technological change and commercialization. This comparative focus calls into question widely held views of technology and the growth of markets as the chief sources of agrarian change. By relating local-level processes to variations in the structure of state power, the history of agrarian resistance, and the particular forms of capitalist development, the authors suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of agrarian change.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">ABSTRACTED FROM THE INTRODUCTION: Illegal or unregistered occupation and utilization of public lands characterize the practice of large numbers of farmers in many less-devel- oped countries. Economic theory suggests that, because squatters lack secure land ownership, they will have fewer investment incentives than farmers with secure ownership. Further, because squatters cannot legally use the land as loan collateral, their access to institutional credit, especially medium- and long-term credit, is inhibited. This has negative effects on squatters' ability to invest. Squatters also face short-term institutional credit constraints, implying a low use of variable inputs. Consequently, theory suggests that squatters' land is less productive than titled land. One policy frequently adopted with the intention of increasing squatters' productivity is the granting of usufruct rights or similar nontradable entitlements. Such policies are viewed by many policymakers as adequate alternatives to the provision of full, unrestricted ownership. Empirical studies of these issues are scant, and no quantitative assessments of the impact of policy measures addressing squatters have been reported. This article presents the results of a quantitative research focusing on Thailand as a case study.</style>

			<abstract>
				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The article discusses the impact of land ownership security on farmers’ input use and output value. Economic theory suggests that farmers with secure legal ownership will have more incentives and better ability to invest, due to a lower perceived risk and a favourable access to institutional credit. This leads to higher variable inputs use and higher output per unit of land. The article uses farm level data from three provinces in Thailand to test the above propositions. The data pertain to samples of squatters, who lack secure legal ownership, as contrasted with legally titled farmers. The results confirm that the provision of secure ownership in LDCs can increase productivity significantly.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">The establishment or upgrading of cadastres and land registration systems is viewed by many as an essential infrastructure investment to be considered by less developed countries. Nevertheless, while many will agree that cadastres and land registration are useful, a decision to actually invest in establishing or expanding these activities will be easier to undertake if it is demonstrated that the resulting benefits are higher than those of other public investments. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to report the results of a recent study undertaken in rural Thailand. That study focused on the economic implications of land titling in the agricultural sector, and utilized farm level data from a sample of about 900 farmers in four Thai provinces. The methodology of the study facilitated not only an estimate of the agricultural productivity gain due to land registration and titling, but also a cost-benefit analysis demonstrating that investment in cadastres and land titling can generate very high returns.</style>

				<style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">In this classic work of economic history and social theory, Karl Polanyi analyzes the economic and social changes brought about by the &quot;great transformation&quot; of the Industrial Revolution. His analysis explains not only the deficiencies of the self-regulating market, but the potentially dire social consequences of untempered market capitalism. New introductory material reveals the renewed importance of Polanyi's seminal analysis in an era of globalization and free trade.</style>
