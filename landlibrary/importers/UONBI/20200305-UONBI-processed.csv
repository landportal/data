"uonbi:11295/40059";"Trouble in Eden: How and Why Unresolved Land Issues Landed 'Peaceful Kenya'in Trouble in 2008";"";"This article looks at the role of land and grievances thereto in the post-election violence experienced in Kenya in late 2007 and early 2008. It argues that the failure of post-colonial governments to craft a cohesive and inclusive national agenda for development has resulted in a fragmented populace. This fragmentation militates against a national ethic as the citizenry congregate around their ethnic groupings as a source of security and guaranteed access to resources such as land. Locating their discourse in the history of land relations in Kenya, the authors argue that the violence experienced was part of a sequence of recurrent displacements stemming from unresolved and politically aggravated land grievances, in a context of population growth, poor governance and static socio-economic attitudes reinforced by absence of alternative policies. They propose that to avoid the recurrence of violence over land, immediate steps should be taken to wean Kenyans off land through providing other avenues for wealth creation, creating a hierarchy of values for land and minimising the returns on speculative landholding. For example, fiscal policies imposing high taxes on speculatively-held land that is not under production would contribute to the releasing of land for production or settlement. They also discuss the need to create new nationalities based on imagined or created identities; these are achievable through educational, bureaucratic, cultural and political pilgrimages in Kenya as opposed to the classical ethnic configuration that currently defines Kenyans' allegiances.";"Kameri-Mbote, Patricia

The introduction of a modern tenure system through colonialism and continued by post-independence government policy and legislation has made the rights of pastoralists and forest dwelling communities insecure. Pastoralism, a livestock based land use that has flourished in arid and semi-arid lands, requires a supportive tenure system for both land and related resources. Pastoralists’ livelihoods are dependent on pasture and water resources. Indeed, the scarcity of water and pasture in areas inhabited by pastoralists raises livelihood security issues as people and animals compete for access to water during dry periods.";"Kameri-mbote, Patricia";"";"";"University of Nairobi";"2013-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/81055";"";"";"";"";"";"";""
"uonbi:11295/81357";"I want it and i want it now: women and land in Africa";"";"In Africa, as elsewhere, land rights have remained a bastion of male power and privilege. Since land is a fundamental resource for improving living conditions and economic empowerment, the lack of land rights for women undermines efforts to promote gender equity and equality within a patriarchal society. The minimal transformation of women’s socio-economic position with regards to access and control of land is, in many cases, due to land reform programmes and related processes whose design or implementation is “gender neutral”. In the worst cases, these legal and institutional processes threaten to even further entrench gender inequalities.

"uonbi:11295/41193";"What Would it Take to Realise the  Promises? Protecting Women’s Rights in  the Kenya National Land Policy of 2009";"";"Land is a critical resource in Kenya, having economic, social, political, 
environmental and cultural significance. Kenya’s population continues to rely 
on land for both subsistence and economic activities. In fact, the increase 
of the population from about 20 million people in the 1960s to about 40 
million currently, has put enormous pressure on land. Only a third of Kenya’s 
land is arable while the rest is arid and semi-arid. With most Kenyans still 
living off the land, contestations over access to, control over and ownership 
of land are prevalent. In the broader Kenya context, the land question has 
emerged as a major political issue that can erupt anytime and threaten the 
existence of the state, as was witnessed in the post-election violence in 
December 2007 (Kameri-Mbote and Kindiki, 2009).
Within this context, women’s rights to land have remained at the core of 
the quest for gender equality in Kenya. Among various Kenyan communities, 
women do not traditionally own land or other immovable property. They have 
use rights which are anchored in their relationships with men as husbands, 
fathers, brothers or uncles. Such access is tenuous and can be denied by the 
male benefactors. This situation affects the survival and livelihoods of women 
and also stifles their effective role in, and contribution to, national development. 
This is despite the fact that women provide the bulk of agricultural labour.";"Kameri-Mbote, Patricia";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2009-12-31";"en";"women";"Land & Gender";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/41193";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/41193/full%20text%20.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/41193/full%20text%20.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"";""
