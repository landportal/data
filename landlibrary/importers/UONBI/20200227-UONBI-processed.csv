"uonbi:11295/15021";"Riparian Zones in Nairobi City";"; A Study in Planning and Conservation Approaches";"This article is a contribution to the current debate on the concepts of land use planning and riparian zone
conservation. It discusses some of the major theoretical and conceptual issues that impact on the
practice of planning and conservation of riparian zones within the City of Nairobi. A conceptualization of
planning and conservation of riparian zone as well as the linkage between the two is discussed as the
paper critically seeks to identify some of the planning and conservation strategies in place, policy, legal
and institutional gaps and challenges faced. Drawing from planning and conservation experiences in the
basin from a recent study by the author, the paper has suggested possible strategies for riparian zone
conservation along Nairobi River Basin. Case study was used as the main research design.
Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data from land users, professionals and public officers
in selected public institutions while documentary data were acquired using archival method from
documents obtained in journals, internet and reports from public and private institutions. It also entailed
use of observation and GIS mapping techniques to capture extent of riparian zones in the study sites. A
total number of 137 respondents participated in the study. Data analysis was done using qualitative and
quantitative techniques. The paper has established implications of land use types, policies and
stakeholders roles, perceptions and behaviour towards riparian zone conservation along Nairobi River
Basin";"Muketha, Silas M.

for most places, remains the weakest link in nearly all
studies of historic vegetation change, in Africa as well
as other places in the world. Notwithstanding,
communities hold a great wealth of knowledge on the
processes and events influencing change on the land
they occupy. The Lambwe Valley, southwestern Kenya,
has a multi-ethnic population of settlers from the early
1950s. These people have seen the transformation of
an initially forested area with diverse challenges to
their survival, to present-day scramble for the remaining
high potential land. A large part of the forces driving
human settlement and consequent changes in land-use
and cover is attributed to the control of tsetse and
trypanosomosis. The application of a socio-economic
method of mapping land-use change with the
participation of the community in this study depicted
trends and the underlying causes. The control of tsetse
fly and therefore trypanosomosis infection was
significant in driving the changes in the valley.
Agricultural intensification is suggested as a means to
support the resultant higher populations of people and
livestock.";"Njoka, T J

Remote sensing and GIS techniques, supplemented with ground reports, were used to determine areas most susceptible to erosion. A representative catchment was then chosen for rainy season monitoring of soil loss, river suspended sediments and discharge response to rainfall. In addition, Gerlach-type traps were used to evaluate erosion rates under different crop covers and slope gradients. A sample of 200 households was interviewed about their perceptions of erosion problems on their farms. Preliminary results suggest that the major sediment-contributing areas are the densely populated and intensively cultivated foothills of the Aberdares, rather than the semi-arid lowlands directly bordering the reservoir. Poorly drained sealed and murram roads, together with footpaths, cattle tracks and gullies, act as extensions of the drainage network during storms, channelling sediment-laden runoff from bare areas around homesteads and schools directly into the river. Subsistence crops, particularly mono-cropped maize, appear to provide poor cover for a major part of the wet season.";"Gichuki, F N

pastoralism and wildlife conservation by providing vast biological resources for pastoralists and
their livestock; and habitat for wildlife. Recently, with the creation of Amboseli National Park
and rapid changes in land tenure systems, the human use of the ecosystem has intensified. This
change has shaped a pastoral landscape composed of livestock grazing, wildlife conservation,
rain-fed and riverine crop cultivation and permanent settlements. A study was undertaken to map
land use over time, and document the causes and consequences of these changes for land cover,
vegetation species diversity and distribution within the 3,112 km2 of Amboseli ecosystem.
Remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems and ground-based techniques were applied.
Land-use and land-cover maps were produced with an accuracy of 85.7% and changes ana lysed
for the years 1988 and 1998. During the ten-year period, changes in natural vegetation cover and
cultivated fields were significant (p<0.05) with cultivated fields replacing 8% of natural
vegetation. Cultivation increased along the mountain slopes, rivers and swamps- areas formerly
used by pastoralists and wildlife for dry season grazing. Land-cover types changed significantly
with bushed grassland and cultivated fields increasing by 10% and 8% respectively; while
grassland and bush land decreased by 6% and 11% respectively. The overall result is a change in
landscape structure with increasing patch diversity as number of patches increased from 157 in
1988 to 250 in 1998. Likewise ecosystem complexity declined with mean cover type area
decreasing significantly (p<0.05) from 1,989 ha in 1988 to 1,247 ha in 1998. Mean cover type
perimeter and dominance value both changed significantly (p<O.O 1) from 234 meters to 211
meters and 2.09 to 2.04 respectively. The emerging land-use and land-cover types can be
attributed to changes in land tenure policies and pastoralists' socio-economic lifestyles. These ongoing
trends pose greater threat to survival of pastoralism and wildlife conservation within East
African rangelands as pastoral lands and wildlife habitats continue to be fragmented and fenced
XII
off. The results of this study reveals the need for integrated research that would address policy
issues, pastoral welfare, benefit sharing, resource accessibility and utilisation, and wildlife
conservation so that landscape fragmentation and resource degradation can be managed.";"Atieno, FO";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2000-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/20112";"";"";"";"";"";"Land use;Land cover;Ecosystem;Amboseli;Kajiando District;Kenya";""

"uonbi:11295/88529";"Women’s Experiences On Food Security In Kenya: Major Challenges That They Face";"";"This paper discusses the major challenges women in Kenya face as they try to ensure and maintain food security at the household level. The challenges include access to and ownership of resources such as land, finance, water and affordable cooking energy; access to markets and proper infrastructure and

education. The paper demonstrates that women in Kenya lack land ownership deeds since land is owned by either their husbands or male relatives. Women also spend a lot of time walking long distances in search of water and wood fuel which prevents them from engaging in other income generating activities.

Moreover, poor infrastructure also makes it difficult for women to access markets for their products or to buy food even when they may have the income. Poor storage facilities or lack of such facilities makes it difficult for women to store food during times of glut and enable them to militate against food insecurity during times of drought. Finally, the paper shows that poor education or the lack of it makes it hard

for women to know the nutritional contents of various foods. Furthermore, this lack of education also makes it difficult for them to get employment and earn an income that is sufficient to maintain food security at the household level. This paper recommends that there should be sensitization of men and

women to the requirements of the Constitution that women should be equal to men in their rights to inheritance. It is, therefore, imperative that County Governments, NGOs, civil societies and community-based organizations should hold civic education sessions for both men and women and educate them on the same. Women should also be involved in the planning and implementation of various

projects that have an impact on their lives. Water, energy and road infrastructure projects should involve women in their identification, planning and implementation. Educating girls benefits the whole community and so just like sensitization on land ownership, parents should also be educated through civic
education on the need to educate the girl child because this will translate to improved welfare both for her and the household as well in terms of improved nutrition and food security.";"Ng’ang’a, Tabitha K";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2015-12-31";"en";"food security;women";"Land & Food Security;Land & Gender";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/88529";"";"";"";"";"";"Food security;food insecurity, food security policy water, land, energy, infrastructure, markets, constitution, experiences, women.";""
"uonbi:11295/19544";"Effects of industries and other land use systems on the water Quality within the Nairobi river sub-catchments, Kenya.";"";"This thesis examines water quality status and deterioration in the Upper-
Athi-Nairobi sub-catchments which covers an area of 1154.4 km2 with an annual
discharge rate of 99242 m3/year (9.9 X 104 m3/yr). It is based on field and
laboratory analysis of water quality parameters.
The subject matter includes the assessment of land use processes
responsible for water quality deterioration. These include Industrial and
Agricultural activities. The study demonstrates how useful industrial
(manufacturing) and agricultural (irrigation) activities are to the water quality
deterioration for different uses. No detailed work of this kind has been carried
out in Kenya so far and certainly not in the Nairobi river sub-catchments.
Water samples were collected from the two distinctive land use activities
and analysed for the different water quality parameters, notably heavy metals
and pesticides.
Heavy metals especially Mercury and Lead were found to' have high
concentrations above the critical WHOand the Kenya standards
[Mercury =0.03 and Lead =0.1 mg/L]. Other elements with harmful effects to
Human health such as Fluoride and Nitrate were found to have concentrations
surpassing the required WHOand keriya standards. Fluoride was measured at 2.5
rngZL and Nitrate at 0.5 mg/litre (L). Pesticide residues in water notably DDT,
""Ambush"" ,""Ridomil"", ""Malathion"" etc were all found to surpass the WHOand Kenya
standards for drinking water. DDT was measured at 0.000086 mg/L ""Ambush""
0.1413 mgZL, ""Ridomil"" 0.147 rngZL, ""Malathion""0.00039 mg/L. Their variations in
mass loadings per day are represented in table 48.
,
xi
Generally water quality was found to deteriorate from one river to another
in respect to the landuse activities at its proximity. Their rates of deterioration
were also found to vary. Ngong River exhibited the highest water quality
deterioration with a rate of 0.42 at Embakasi, followed by Nairobi River at
Dandora with a rate of 0.39. Kamiti River and Kasarani had the least rates of
rt<..
deterioration. This were well depicted in figure 13. These corresponded or
conformed well with the land use activities along their water courses.
Water pollutants were also found to vary with time (season) from one river
course to another. CODand BODdemonstrated a time persistence nature for most
rivers and the same with TDS. These again showed close relationship with the
land use processes. Their sources were also demonstrated to relate most to the
land-use activity.
The deterioration in water quality within the study area suggested harmful
effects to the human especially as it relates to
domestic usages of the water. This mostly related to surpasses of some water
quality parameters (e.g. Fluoride, Mercury, Pesticides such as DDT and
""Malathion"") of the recommended WHOand the Kenya quideline standards for
drinking water quality.
The study recommends an evaluation of the water quality status for
different uses within the study areas and especially groundwater and surface
waters. Human health aspects should also be considered. There must be j shiftt
towards proper land-water-conservation practices in-corporated within the
management of water resources. This must take in consideration the quality of
the waters and the sources of the water pollutants.";"Kithia, Shadrack M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"1992-12-31";"en";"land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/19544";"";"";"";"";"";"Industries and other land use systems;Water Quality;Nairobi river sub-catchments, Kenya.";""

"uonbi:11295/21138";"The impact of changing land use patterns on the numbers and distribution of livestock and wild herbivores in the Tana River District, Kenya";"";"The intent of this study was to examine the impact of
changing land use patterns on the numbers and distribution
of livestock and wild herbivores in the Tana River District,
Kenya.
A multi-method approach of aerial surveys,
questionnaires, interviews and secondary data sources were
employed to realize the objectives.
Results indicate that changes in land use patterns and
types have created conflicts that led to the reduction of
the range and affected distribution of pastoral livestock
and wild herbivores. Land use changes, such as irrigation
are possibly responsible for reduction in the numbers and
distribution of pastoral livestock and wild herbivores.
Parks, reserves and ranches have also reduced the range of
pastoral livestock. The creation of ranches has yet to
affect wild herbivore distribution because of minimal
development of the ranches but in future, wild herbivores
may be affected.
Other factors responsible for reduction in numbers
include diseases and pests, drought and poaching. Poaching
is directly responsible for the decline in elephant and
rhinoceros populations. The droughts of 1979 and
particularly that of 1984 also contributed to reductions in
numbers of livestock and wild herbivores.
Orma pastoralists attribute the curtailment of the
grazing range of theii stock to the influx of Somali
pastoralists. Overgrazing due to this influx and large
herds of livestock have rendered some range areas bare.
To alleviate the land use conflicts strategies
recommended include: multiple land use practice; continued
conservation of animals in parks and reserves; compensation
of farmers for losses suffered; provision of corridors for
access to grazing and watering areas; and allowing
pastoralists into reserves during periods of drought.";"Wargute, PW";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"1992-02-28";"en";"land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/21138";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/21138/Wargute_The%20impact%20of%20changing%20land%20use%20patterns%20on%20the%20numbers%20and%20distribution%20of%20livestock%20and%20wild%20herbivores%20in%20the%20Tana%20River%20district%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/21138/Wargute_The%20impact%20of%20changing%20land%20use%20patterns%20on%20the%20numbers%20and%20distribution%20of%20livestock%20and%20wild%20herbivores%20in%20the%20Tana%20River%20district%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land use;Distribution;Livestock;Wild Herbivores;Tana River District;Kenya";""

This study examines the responsibility undertaken by the African Union framework and Guidelines on Land Policy (AU F&G) in the resolution of land associated conflicts in Kenya. Kenya has experienced a long past characterized by land associated conflicts since the colonial era and in subsequent regimes, the attempt to resolve land associated conflicts has necessities the land reforms in the country and the undertaking of a National Land Policy. A consensus between African leaders on land matters and problems in Africa necessitated the development and subsequent endorsement of the in AU F&G the guidelines are to aid African states in developing their guidelines on land policy that attain acceptable global standards of good governance. This study uses a qualitative method of research. The main purpose of the study is to comprehend the role AU F&G, in tackling conflicts associated with land. The study findings indicate that Kenya’s of land reform agenda has taken into consideration the continentals guidelines on land policy. The reform agenda is geared toward developing land guiding principles and laws that address the setbacks of land, conflict on land being one of them. The study concludes that the Kenyan National land policy and her new constitution have attempted to handle the issues associated with land related conflict and provide for its resolution.

with significant domains of autonomous discretionary power, will lead to the equitable and efficient management of
natural resources. The paper focuses on the three domains of power conceived by some theorists as critical in the management
of natural resources, namely making rules, implementing rules, and resolving disputes in relation to these rules.
Based on a case study of a village in Tanzania, the article identifies some of the main constraints the village council
encounters concerning the efficient and equitable management of common lands, and discusses whether devolution is
the solution for overcoming these constraints. It is concluded that the role and functions of higher levels of government
in decentralised natural resource management are essential and require due consideration beyond the point of arguing
for more autonomy to local government.";"Nathan, Iben

It is postulated in this paper that there would be no significant variations inland sale value/ land purchase price in the areas of Eastlands within the
city of Nairobi and areas immediately outside the city fringe. As a result, a land speculator
would be indifferent between the areas within the city and areas outside the city because the two zones shall generate the same profit levels. However, the variations in land
delivery costs in the two zones would impel the land speculator to opt for areas outside the city where he/she shall maximize profits. To test the postulation advanced in this paper, the average land values in some sampled areas of Eastlands
and other areas sampled from the peri-urban zones were compared using the test static. Secondly,the average land values in the two zones were also tabulated and compared using the test. Thirdly, the average land transaction costs in the two areas were
compared using the test. The inquiry establishes that the duality in land use management in Kenya, began during colonial rule and continued to post colonial era, has resulted into a
more expensive urban land registration and delivery model in Nairobi and a less expensive rural land registration and delivery model outside the city. Yet, the investigation did not establish any significant variations in land values between East Lands and the areas sampled in Machakos and Kajiado. Consequently, the hiatus in land delivery
cost in the two zones has created an opportunity for land speculation in areas immediately outside the city fringe.This then was found to be the cause of accelerated urban sprawl.";"Ayonga, Jeremiah N.";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2013-12-31";"en";"area;land delivery;land speculation";"Land & Investments";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/71826";"";"";"";"";"";"Variations;Land delivery cost;A factor;In land speculation;Metropolitan Nairobi";""

The general aim of the research was to show that the Kenyan people in their constituent power have perceived land as more than just property which readily converts to market value with relevant injuries being recompensed conclusively with awards of damages. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 sets out governing principles on land policy. Finite, yet socially, economically and culturally vital, land in Kenya has merited the declaration that it, “shall be held, used and managed in a manner that is equitable, efficient, productive and sustainable. The findings of this research show that public land, community land and private land are the three categorizations made in the constitution; and community land, a core sphere of this research, refers to land attached, historically, socially and for beneficial use, to a distinct population group: an ethnic community, a cultural community, or some other social interest-group. The Constitution, in its solicitude for social-group welfare, lays a foundation for policy, programming and juristic openings towards practical solution. Moreover this research will also show that a governance question so fundamental in a progressive constitutional order merits legal attention to: community interests and the land question; Kenya‟s experience in relation to community land; and comparative experience drawn from further afield.

Sampling of mites from soils was carried out in eight LUTs which included maize-based system (Zea mays), coffee (Coffea Arabica), horticulture, napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), fallow, pine (Pinus patula), cypress (Cypressus lusitanica), natural forest.
LUT significantly influenced abundance, richness and diversity of the soil mites. During the short rains the diversity of soil mites increased in the order napier ,maize-based system, horticulture, coffee, fallow, natural forest, pine forest, cypress plantation while the long rains season abundance increased in the order maize-based system, coffee, horticulture, napier, natural forest, fallow, pine forest, cypress forest. Higher abundance, richness and diversity of the mites was observed in the less disturbed forest ecosystems unlike the agro-ecosystems, which are often disturbed with intensive cultivation A total of 37 families were recorded with 20 oribatid families, 10 mesostigmatid families and 7 prostigmatid families. The families that ranked highest in abundance across the LUT were Scheloribatidae, Oppidae (Oribatida) and Rhodacaridae (Mesostigmata).

The improvement of the welfare of inhabitants of arid and semi-arid lands, either through the enhancement of existing livelihoods or the promotion of alternative ones, and their potential constraints are discussed. Alternative livelihoods are discussed under regenerative and extractive themes with respect to environmental stability. Regenerative (i.e., non-extractive) livelihoods include activities like apiculture, poultry keeping, pisciculture, silkworm production, drought tolerant cash cropping, horticulture, community wildlife tourism, processing of livestock and crop products, agro-forestry for tree products, and micro-enterprises in the informal sector. Examples of livelihoods that are extractive or potentially so include timber production, woodcarving, basketry, brick making, sand scooping, and charcoal making. Suggestions to improve these livelihoods in a sustainable manner are offered.";"Ngugi, Robinson K

"uonbi:11295/97951";"Effects of extreme land fragmentation on wildlife and livestock population abundance and distribution";"";"Fragmentation, degradation and loss of natural habitats are now recognised as major threats to wildlife conservation and mobile pastoralism in East African savannas. These processes are driven primarily by land tenure and policy, increasing human population, expansion of settlements and agricultural farms, road networks, urban development and fencing. To understand and characterise the forces driving habitat fragmentation, we analyse how biophysical (soils, slope, rainfall, rivers) and human-created (roads, towns, parks, quarries) features influence where people choose to fence the land in the Athi-Kaputiei ecosystem of Kenya. We also explore the consequences of land fragmentation through fencing on the abundance and distribution of wildlife and livestock populations. We show that fences are most highly concentrated along the major roads and around the major urban centres. Movements of migratory wildebeest and zebra between the Nairobi National Park and the pastoral Kitengela Plains adjoining the park on the south are getting increasingly impeded by increasing concentration of fences. Populations of wildebeest and other herbivores have collapsed to a small fraction of their former abundance largely owing to destruction of their habitats and obstruction of their movements between the park and the pastoral lands by fences and other land use developments. Conserving the key seasonal wildlife dispersal areas in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains is critical to ensuring the future viability of several key wildlife species in Nairobi National Park. Several initiatives, including a conservation land lease program has been launched, but their spatial coverage and funding levels would need to be greatly expanded to secure sufficient open spaces for both wildlife and livestock.";"Said, Mohammed Y

supply and management. Overall, Africa's performance in terms of agricultural
production and productivity remain inadequate and the region has failed to make progress
in food security (Republic of Kenya, 2002). Therefore, successful agricultural reform
programs will require raising women's productivity. The current study examines the
existence of real evidence that women's limited access to land constitute a significant
barrier to agricultural improvement.
This study examines the relationships between the amount of agricultural land accessible
to women of different marital status, women's tenure security and agricultural
productivity. The study was carried out in central division, Machakos District, Kenya. A
sample of 100 women farmers was interviewed about their access to land and their tenure
security, their agricultural production, access to extension, level of decision making and
level of education. The study involved descriptive analysis, using percentages, cross
tabulations, correlation coefficients, chi-square and graphs to show the nature and the
influence of these variables. A regression analysis was used to establish the relationship
between various important variables.
The results established that the main factors that determine women's agricultural
productivity are: level of education, land tenure security, level of decision making and the
total production costs. The study also established that women access to land is influenced
by land tenure security, total area of land owned by the household and the household size.
The study showed that different categories of women face different problems in their
agricultural activities, widows being the most disadvantaged. Based on these findings,

sustained by a combination of factors. However, reviews indicate that these factors cannot be generalized, as they
tend to be case specific. A study was therefore conducted to explore the history and reasons for enclosure establishment
in Chepareria, a formerly degraded communal rangeland in north-western Kenya. While Vi-Agroforestry Organization
accounting for 52.5 % was the main source of knowledge on enclosure establishment; it has now emerged
that rangeland enclosures among the Pokot pastoral community existed prior to land management interventions by
Vi- Agroforestry. Results indicated that there are three categories of enclosures which were established for boundary
demarcation, provide grazing reserves, enable proper land management, facilitate crop cultivation in a pastoral setup
and to curb land degradation. The role of self-trigger [accounting for most of the spontaneous enclosures (73.5 %)]
indicates the continued establishment and expansion of areas under enclosure management as private land ownership
accounting for 51.7 % of enclosure tenure continues to gain momentum in Chepareria. While rangeland enclosures
in Chepareria were mainly established for boundary demarcation, to alleviate pasture scarcity and enable proper
management of formerly degraded areas; they have facilitated land restoration and rehabilitation by increasing flexibility
in land, fodder and livestock management amongst agro-pastoralists in Chepareria over the last three decades.
To ensure that rehabilitated areas do not revert to their previously degraded state; technical interventions are needed
to allow for a more intensive use of rangeland resources within enclosed areas.";"Wairore, John N

proceed unnoticed, thus reducing the likelihood of appropriate and timely control action. Presently, there are few practical frameworks to help
countries design national strategies and policies for its control. The study presented here developed a framework for the national assessment of
land degradation. This framework is envisaged to support governments in formulating policies on land degradation. It uses time-series remote
sensing data to identify the rate and extent of land degradation, local experts to identify prevalent degradation types and drivers of the degradation
and
field observations to validate the overall assessment. Its simplicity, use of freely downloadable input data and self-triangulation of the assessment methods make it suitable for rapid assessment of land degradation on a national scale. It was tested in Somalia, where it exhibited accuracy
greater than 60 per cent when assessing land degradation. This framework is relevant for designing national strategies and policies that address
land degradation and provides an opportunity for accurate identi
fi
cation of areas to target with comprehensive local assessment. Testing of the
framework in Somalia showed that about one-third of the country was degraded because of loss of vegetation cover, topsoil loss and to the
decline of soil moisture. Overgrazing, excessive tree cutting and poor agronomic practices in agricultural areas were identified as the primary
drivers of the country’s land degradation. These drivers are encouraged by the prevailing communal land tenure practices, poor governance

However, the performance of the various indigenous and exotic tree and shrub species in rehabilitating these saline soils has not been examined. Therefore this study aimed at evaluating the performance of various exotic and indigenous tree and shrub species in rehabilitating saline soils in North Horr. Mortality and relative growth rates for both exotic and indigenous tree and shrub species were assessed. Compared to indigenous species, exotic tree species (not naturally growing in the Marsabit ecosystem) failed to sustain an improved growth performance in saline soils of North Horr. The results of this study demonstrate that survival rates for indigenous plants in North Horr are higher than those of exotic ones. Thus, to rehabilitate saline soils and stabilize sand dunes, the use of indigenous tree and shrub species adapted to such saline conditions should be encouraged.";"Olukoye, G A

Africa by the Europeans the present route to Uganda originating
from the Kenyan Coast town of Mombasa was rarely used
because of the difficulties experienced in sustaining long
caravans over the arid Nyika Region between the Coast and
the Kenya Highlands, and the hostility of tribes inhabiting
this area - especially the Masai. Colonial penetration of
the present area known as Kenya began about 1850 and intensified

Colonial penetration from 1885 to 1894 was done by
Sir William Mackinon's Imperial British East African Company -

newly acquired sphere of influence. Hostile tribes were
easily subdued by use of advanced gun technology - the
invention of a Maxim machine gun - and astute diplomacy of
devide and rule as practiced by colocial administrators of
this time. With one menace eliminated it was possible to
manage caravans bearing water and other supplies to cross

and economic productivity is back on the international development agenda.
Belief in such a direct causal relationship had been abandoned in the early
1990s, following four decades of land tenure reform experiments that failed to
produce the anticipated efficiency results. The work of Hernando de Soto has
provided the springboard for this revival. De Soto argues that formal property
rights hold the key to poverty reduction by unlocking the capital potential of
assets held informally by poor people.
De Soto’s justifications of formal title do not differ much from justifications that
were advanced for ambitious land tenure reforms in various sub-Saharan African
countries, starting with Kenya in the 1950s. Introduction of formal title in the
African areas was seen as the key to solving problems of land degradation and
improving agriculture by providing farmers with security of tenure that would
create incentives for further investment in the land.
This paper argues that there are five shortcomings in both the old and contemporary
arguments for formalisation of land title. First, legality is constructed
narrowly to mean only formal legality. Therefore legal pluralism is equated with
extra-legality. Second, there is an underlying social evolutionist bias that presumes
inevitability of the transition to private (conflated with individual) ownership
as the destiny of all societies. Third, the presumed link between formal title
and access to credit facilities has not been borne out by empirical evidence.
Fourth, markets in land are understood narrowly to refer only to ’formal
markets’. Fifth, the arguments in favour of formulisation of title as the means
to secure tenure ignore the fact that formal title could also generate insecurity.";"Musembi, Celestine Nyamu";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2006-12-31";"en";"agriculture;land tenure;property;property rights";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/41553";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/41553/Wp272.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/41553/Wp272.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"property rights;land relations;agriculture;poverty reduction;land tenure;Africa.";""
"uonbi:11295/99821";"Land use strategies for sustainable wetland development and protection: a case study of Yala swamp";"";"Kenya has a wealth of wetland ecosystems that support diverse and unique habitats. These wetlands provide numerous ecological goods and services but are under tremendous stress due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and agricultural intensification; manifested by the shrinkage in their areal extent, and decline in the hydrological, economic and ecological functions they perform. Yala swamp, the largest fresh water wetland in Kenya measuring about 17,500 ha supports a large biodiversity and is a source of livelihoods to communities around it. The aim of this study was to establish the current utilization of the wetland, the effects of the utilization on conservation and to explore sustainable land use strategies for deployment at Yala Swamp to safeguard it from negative impacts of development and associated human activities. Data and information were obtained from primary and secondary sources through field survey in the Yala Swamp wetland, in which 90 households drawn from two locations bordering the swamp in Bondo and Siaya sub-counties were interviewed. Interviews were also administered to local community leaders, selected key informants in the Siaya County Government and Kenya Wildlife Service as well as officers from Dominion Farms. The research instruments included questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews (KII), direct observation and, lastly, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with two groups representing the two aforementioned counties. From the study, it is evident that Yala Swamp is the primary source of livelihood to the surrounding communities. They rely on it for a variety of ecosystem services such as fish harvesting, farming, papyrus extraction for mat making, livestock grazing amongst others. However, evidence on the ground such as land degradation, water pollution, encroachment and attendant conflicts shows clearly that continuous unplanned utilization of the wetlands‘ resources is a great and present threat to the existence of the fragile ecosystem. The study suggests a raft of land use strategies to bring order in access and utilization of the resource which in turn should ease the current pressure. These include development of land use plan whose outcome would be zoning of land for specific uses, regulation of intensity of use, formulation of legal and administrative instruments to support the plan; completion of survey of the swamp to define boundaries with the surrounding community and stem encroachment; compulsory acquisition of surrounding lands to create a buffer around the swamp; land exchange programme in which less ecologically sensitive parcels elsewhere are exchanged with private land near the swamp; and finally, the government through Kenya Wildlife Service to re-examine the process that led to the gazettment of a section of the swamp and come to a common understanding with the community.";"Okech, Fredrick O";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-11-30";"en";"development;land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/99821";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/99821/Okech_Land%20use%20strategies%20for%20sustainable%20wetland%20development%20and%20protection.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/99821/Okech_Land%20use%20strategies%20for%20sustainable%20wetland%20development%20and%20protection.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Wetlands, Land use, Strategies, Sustainable, Yala Swamp, Kenya";""

"uonbi:11295/22729";"Land degradation and its control in the Kibwezi area, Kenya";"";"Most of our semi-arid land is threatened with increased land deterioration due to
changes in land use especially in areas where soils have sealing properties which
hinder infiltration of rain- water. The study was carried out in Kibwezi Division,
Machakos District, a distance of 220 km. from Nairobi. It was designed to investigate
major causes of land deterioration following human settlement around 1963 and low
cost measures of reversing it.
The experiment was designed to investigate whether slashing bush and spreading
it on the denuded ground would improve infiltration and if so, whether the effect would
be due to interception of rainfall energy and reduced sealing, interception of runoff,
insect activity i.e. termites or other organisms living on the deadwood and breaking the
seal in the process or due to a combination of one or more factors. This was
investigated using twelve (12) runoff plots on a mean slope of 0.1% with ferral chromic
Luvisols and 20% brushwood cover. Different forms of treatments under natural rainfall
were applied. Supplementary studies on infiltration; after insect activity on the soil seal
when the soil seal is intact and after the soil seal is removed ,were conducted by
surface ponding next to runoff plots for comparison. A farm survey with a
questionnaire on causes and state of land deterioration, and measures used to
encourage revegetation, was carried out on settled areas. Studies were conducted to
determine the botanical composition of virgin land. Socia-economic data on some
plants, for example, Baobabs left in cropland, was collected from the local communities.
Treatment effects compared with the control plots, were significant (P (- 0.05) in
reducing soil loss and runoff. Rainfall and runoff interception using 20% brushwood
cover together with or without insect activity is significant in reducing soil loss and
runoff.
Bare denuded plots lost an average of 53% of the rainfall as runoff and 65.5t/ha.
of soil compared with 38% of rainfall as runoff and 19tjha. of soil from plots with
rainfall/ runoff interception together with insect activity. Rainfall interception only and
rainfall/runoff inter.~eption without insect activity lost a total of
32t/ha. and 25.7t/ha. respectively.
Efficiency values in reducing soil loss and runoff were generally high for all the
treatments. Raintall/runoff interception with insect activity treatment reduced soil loss
by 71% ,without insect activity 61%, and rainfall interception only by 51%
Soil sealing in semi-arid areas as a result of raindrop impact could be due to low
organic matter (~ 0.1%) and high sand content ( ~ 69%) and fine clay fractions which
could possibly block the soil pores after the soil aggregate disintegrates under raindrop
impact. Soil sealing may also be attributed to runoff. Clay fractions in the soil, act like
cement in sand and it contributes to the hardness of the soils during the dry season.
The effect of this is low infiltration, high runoff and water erosion when rains come.
Clay content at the soil surface causes decreased porosity and thus soil sealing.
Insect activities were found to assist in creating rough and fragmented surfaces on
the denuded sealed soils. This was found to enhance rainfall infiltration for a short
period on ponding water, implying that enhanced revegetation of denuded lands can
be achieved by creating conditions necessary for rainwater to pond.
Settlement in the area ,though relatively recent and mainly within the last 25 years,
has resulted in serious erosion in some places. This indicates that much greater
attention should be paid to soil and water conservation.
Most of the land deterioration from stable vegetated land with minimal soil erosion
has been due to vegetation removal exposing soil to accelerated erosion and increased
runoff in most cultivated farms. This has been made worse by poorly maintained and
. lor lack of soil and water conservation measures on cropland and lack of proper
grazingmanagement and jor restoring cover whenever it is diminished, by using

information systems (GIS). The primary objective of this project is an attempt to
develop an automated Land Information Management System (LIMS). In Kenya today,
land information is held mostly in paper form, managed manually and even the paper
records themselves are not optimally organized. The process of retrieving and
disseminating this information is inefficient, time consuming and cannot support timely
decision making.
This project represents the formalization of the geometrical portion of data concerning
certain kinds of geographical phenomena. This formalization is modeled in unified
modeling language (UML) to develop a database. The UML is used to capture both the
static and dynamic components of the cadastre given its many entities and attributes.
The report develops a prototype database that is based on the Cadastre 2014
document and attempts to customize the database to suit the Kenyan environment. The
project concludes that UML presents an opportunity to render the data and its
processes in a manner that reduces redundancy and eliminates duplication of roles in
the cadastral data recording system. Modeling presents a simpler way of presenting a
standardized way for designing the database. This study has developed a prototype LIMS using the object-oriented modeling approach. This approach provides a natural method for describing real world spatial entities, avoids data fragmentation and enables useful capabilities for managing databases. The object-oriented modeling allows better integration, data consistency,
minimizes reformatting, convenient data merging and saves a lot of time. It is a feasible

The results show that the dominant actors were the bulking and processing agents who provided inputs and were a source of grass seed market to the producers. The producers preferred contractual agreements that allowed them to sell their grass seed to markets of their choice. As independent grass seed traders allowed for seed price negotiation, they were popular amongst the producers and thus handled the most volume of seeds marketed. Drought occurrence, inability of existing outlets to purchase grass seed at times, together with low prices offered for producers’ grass seed were found to be among the challenges facing the producers.

This study evaluated methods of establishing grasses in the semi-arid rangelands of Makucni District, Kenya. Three methods of land preparation and two seeding methods were compared for their effectiveness in the establishment of three range grasses. These were tractor ploughing, oxen ploughing and burning. Drilling and broadcasting as seeding methods were investigated. The grasses used were Eragrosris superba (Pycr), Cenchrus ciHaris L and Ententpogon macrostachyus (Hochst and A. Rich) Munro ex Benth. Height, tiller production and grass seedling mortality were the parameters measured as indicators of seedling establishment.
Land preparation treatments involving ploughing were significantly different from burning (P<0.1). The burned plots had the shortest plants with the least number of tillers and suffered from the highest seedling mortality. However, the burned plots had the highest density of volunteer annual grasses. There were no significant differences (P<0.1) between tractor and oxen ploughed plots. The method of seeding did not significantly affect tiller production and seedling mortality.
Significant response to seeding method was observed in height only. On average the drilled plots showed better establishment.
Response of the three grasses to land preparation and seeding was significantly different (P<0.1). Eragrostis superba had the better establishment than Cenchrus ciliaris and Erueropogon macrostachyus.
From this study, oxen ploughing was shown to have the same effectiveness as tractor ploughing in pasture establishment. Vegetation degradation can therefore be controlled if suitable species, and cultural practices which are easily adoptable are used. Oxen ploughing and broadcasting Eragrostis suprrba are recommended for the Kibwezi area according to the findings of this study.";"Njenga, Francis, M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"1992-12-31";"en";"rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/96206";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/96206/Njenga_The%20Effect%20of%20Land%20Treatment%20and%20Seeding%20Methods%20on%20Establishment%20of%20Three%20Range%20Grasses%20in%20the%20Semi-arid%20Rangelands%20of%20Makueni%20District%2c%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/96206/Njenga_The%20Effect%20of%20Land%20Treatment%20and%20Seeding%20Methods%20on%20Establishment%20of%20Three%20Range%20Grasses%20in%20the%20Semi-arid%20Rangelands%20of%20Makueni%20District%2c%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Land Treatment";""

The effectiveness of aging contour hedgerows and grass strips for erosion control on an about 15% slope of an Alfisol was compared. The five treatments were Senna siamea hedgerows with tree prunings applied as mulch to crops (H + M), hedgerows with crops with prunings removed (H), mulch only applied to crops (M), crops with Panicum maximum grass strips (G), and a sole crop control of a rotation of maize (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Cumulative results for four consecutive seasons showed that most successful treatment H + M reduced soil loss from just over 100 to only 2 Mg ha-1 (or t ha-1) and runoff from just below 100 to 20 mm as compared to the sole crop control C. Grass strips were less effective (15 Mg ha-1 and 46 mm, respectively). Cumulative maize yields (1993-1995) were reduced by 35% in H + M, 55% in H, and by more than 60% in G. Generally, the M plot produced similar yields to those of C. Cowpea yields were less affected than maize because mean rainfall was well above average during the cowpea seasons. The hedgerows, particularly in combination with mulch, and grass strips kept soil loss on steep slopes at tolerable and sustainable rates. Strong trade-offs between erosion control and crop productivity need not be a major deterrent to adoption by farmers, if the grass and trees provide other significant benefits to farmers";"Kinama, J.M.

Random soil samples were collected from 40 farms (12 under LG and 28 under AC) and 11 forest sites together with 7 water samples from rivers and streams leading to Sasumua Dam. A further 36 core ring soil samples were collected at 0-10 cm depth, from three land uses, 12 from each land use type for analysis of bulk density and hydraulic conductivity. Measurement of CEC, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, pH, EC, base saturation, total N, soil carbon and texture, bulk density and hydraulic conductivity was done on soil samples while water samples were analysed for quality. Effects of land management practices were determined using structured questionnaire. Data obtained from laboratory was subjected to analysis of variance using Genstat while that from questionnaire was analysed using SPSS.  To determine the minimum data set, results obtained were subjected to factor analysis using principal component analysis. The results showed a significant change of soil pH and silt content when land is converted from forest to grazing land and annual crops cultivation. In grazing land  ; CEC , exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ ,  base saturation and SOC decreased by 8%, 42%, 52%, 32% and 8% respectively while Total N increased by 6 % . In annual crop cultivated land; exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ , base saturation and SOC decreased by 31%, 40%, 32%  and 8% respectively, while CEC, Total N, and bulk density increased by 14%, 23% and 10% ,respectively.  Land management practices such as intensive cultivation of horticultural crops, overgrazing of pastureland and farming on steep areas were contributing to soil chemical and physical degradation while addition of farmyard manure and agro-forestry were contributing to sustainability of soil organic carbon and bulk density. Tillage in cultivated fields influenced increase in CEC. Water quality results indicated that land use management affected quality as it flows from forest to areas with human settlements.  Soil pH, texture, SOC and CEC were found to be the minimum data set for determination of soil health in the catchment as they cumulatively accounted for 83% of the variation in component loadings.";"Kimigo, J

Climate change interlocks with peoples life-worlds differently for different reasons. Understanding the foregoing can inform and make policy more relevant. What are the Samburu peoples discernment of climate change and how have they confronted it? The paper examines the Samburu perspectives of climate change and the resulting coping, adaptation mechanisms and practice, and their prospects. The paper is based on a case study of Samburu East District through a survey, life histories and focus group discussions. The Samburu indicate that climate change leads to soil erosion, some fauna species extinction, water and pasture scarcity and intensified conflicts over resources. This trend impacts negatively on their livelihoods due to food shortage, human and livestock diseases, social and family instability. Nomadic herding increased their vulnerability due to conflicts over resources and livestock losses to cattle rustling. Diversified livelihoods center on adaptive drought tolerant species like camels and cropping which turns out more precarious. Although it conjures up a helter-skelter livelihood imagery, the Samburu display resiliency and order in confronting climate change and policy support will further buttress their responses.";"Ogara, William O

"uonbi:11295/51149";"Analysis of the Effect of Land Tenure on Technical Efficiency in Smallholder Crop Production in Kenya";"";"Agriculture is the backbone of the Kenyan economy contributing 26% to GDP and 70% to
employment. Majority of the farmers in Kenya are smallholder farmers possessing less than 3
acres of land. The agricultural sector in Kenya has been facing several challenges among them
declining yields. While the decline in yields could be associated with several other factors, it
could also be as a result of the effect of insecure land tenure systems which are little understood.
This study examines the technical efficiency of alternative land tenure systems among
smallholder farmers and identifying the determinants of inefficiency with the objective of
exploring land tenure policies that would enhance efficiency in production. The study is based on
the understanding that land tenure alone will not be enough to indicate the levels of efficiency of
individual farms, other socio economic factors such as gender, education and farm size would
also be expected to be important determinants of efficiency. A stochastic frontier was used to
estimate technical efficiency and relate it to land tenure and socio economic factors using data
from 22 districts from the main agro–ecological zones.
The study found that parcels with land titles have a higher efficiency level. Other factors such as
education status of head, access to fertilizers, and group participation were also found to
significantly influence technical efficiency. The study recommends that the process of land
registration should be extended to other regions of the country but at the same time other factors
such as access to inputs and improvement of education status should also be addressed.";"Kariuki, D K

The Desert Margins Programme (DMP) in Kenya has made some contribution to understanding which technology options have potential in reducing land degradation in marginal areas and conserving biodiversity through demonstrations, testing of the most promising natural resource management options, developing sustainable alternative livelihoods and policy guidelines, and replicating successful models. In extension of sustainable natural resource management, two types of strategies were used: (i) strategies for the promotion of readily available technologies and (ii) approaches for participatory learning and action research. Thus DMP-Kenya initiated upscaling of four ‘best-bet’ technologies. Under the rangeland/livestock management options, scaling-up activities include improvement of rangeland productivity, rangeland resource management through community-based range resources monitoring/assessment, and fodder conservation for home-based herds. Restoration of degraded lands included rehabilitation of rangelands using the red paint approach in conservation of Acacia tortilis, control of Prosopis, planting of Acacia senegal trees in micro-catchments, and rehabilitation of degraded areas through community enclosures. Improved land, nutrient, and water management involved upscaling water harvesting and integrated nutrient management (INM) technologies. Activities under tree-crop/livestock interactions included upscaling of Melia volkensii and fruit trees (mangoes) and enhancing biodiversity conservation through support of beekeeping as a viable alternative livelihood. Participatory learning and action research (PLAR) was used for technology development and dissemination. Capacity building and training was a major component of upscaling of these best-bet technologies";"Esilaba, AO

These land-use and land-cover changes affect directly and indirectly the environment, economy and society at Ruiru subcounty, Kiambu county and Kenya in general. Although their impacts have been recognized long ago, it‟s only a few years back that they became a cause of countrywide concern. The result is an intricate web of impacts that threaten the long-term viability of natural and social systems.In other words, the sustainability of the total environment–society–economy system is under threat.Various studies have been done but most of them are concerned with land use management and development control measures in Ruiru. This study aimed at determining the cause and effects of land use change and to understand the reason the land use change is increasing instead of decreasing.The study determined the current land uses in Gitothua ward, examined the cause of conversion of land use in Gitothua ward, established the impacts of conversion of land use conversions in Gitothua ward, explored intervention measures to be taken to reduce adverse effect of land use conversions.
The research used semi-structured questionnaires to interview 370 households and 5 Key informants as well as observation and photography to collect the data. The population of Gitothua ward is mostly composed of immigrants and the people who have stayed in Gitothua ward all their life. This is because of the sprawl from Nairobi that attracted people from different places to Gitothua ward. Rapid urbanization took place in Gitothua ward only recently as indicated by the population that has resided in Gitothua ward in the last 10 years. The study established that there is low public participation on land policies in Gitothua Ward resulting to weak and ineffective land institutions which have led to increased land conversions in the in
vi
Gitothua ward to a very great extent. The reasons given by the respondents were that the Ruiru Land Control board, which is mandated by Land Control Act Chapter 302 to protect agricultural land from conversions, is incompetent due to inadequate staff, funds and technical capacity. Also, it was noted that land conversion in Gitothua ward has led to increase in land values to a great extent. In addition, land conversion in Gitothua ward has led to job creation to a very great extent and thatland conversion in Gitothua ward has led to has led to pressure on the existing infrastructure to a great extent.Moreover, the study revealed that policy framework to regulate agricultural land use conversions in Gitothua ward is inadequate and ineffective. The respondents cited lack of a national land use policy, urban sprawl and wanton destruction of agricultural land as evidence of inadequate policy. The respondents indicated that there must be deliberate efforts national policy to regulate agricultural land use conversions. It was also revealed those regulatory and institutional frameworks to regulate agricultural land use conversions in Gitothua ward are inadequate and ineffective.";"Macharia, Chris Karanja";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2018-12-31";"en";"area;land use;urban areas";"Urban Tenure";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/104255";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/104255/IMPLICATIONS%20OF%20CONVERSION%20OF%20AGRICULTURAL%20LAND%20USE%20IN%20PERI%20.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/104255/IMPLICATIONS%20OF%20CONVERSION%20OF%20AGRICULTURAL%20LAND%20USE%20IN%20PERI%20.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Agricultural Land use";""

A review of catchment studies (n = 37) conducted in East Africa evaluating the impacts of Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) on discharge, surface runoff, and low flows.

New hydrological insights
Forest cover loss is accompanied by increased stream discharges and surface runoff. No significant difference in stream discharge is observed between bamboo and pine plantation catchments, and between cultivated and tea plantation catchments. Trend analyses show that despite forest cover loss, 63% of the watersheds show non-significant changes in annual discharges while 31% show increasing trends. Half of the watersheds show non-significant trends in wet season flows and low flows while 35% reveal decreasing trends in low flows. Modeling studies estimate that forest cover loss increases annual discharges and surface runoff by 16 ± 5.5% and 45 ± 14%, respectively. Peak flows increased by a mean of 10 ± 2.8% while low flows decreased by a mean of 7 ± 5.3%. Increased forest cover decreases annual discharges and surface runoff by 13 ± 1.9% and 25 ± 5%, respectively. Weak correlations between forest cover and runoff (r = 0.42, p < 0.05), mean discharge (r = 0.63, p < 0.05) and peak discharge (r = 0.67, p < 0.05) indicate that forest cover alone is not an accurate predictor of hydrological fluxes in East African catchments. The variability in these results supports the need for long-term field monitoring to better understand catchment responses and to improve the calibration of currently used simulation models.";"Guzha, A.C.

Laikipia district, Kenya, between 1991 and 1995 inclusive, to understand crop yield behaviour due to
selected soil moisture conservation methods applicable in semi-arid areas. The treatments were:
Grevillea robusta trees root pruned, compared to unpruned, both in combination with (1) minimum
tillage and mulching with 3t/ha maize stalks harvested from the plots with additional stalks collected
from the nearby farms, and (2) the locally applied method of deep tillage practiced by the immigrants
from wetter regions, acting as the control. Results showed that: (i) plots with root pruned Grevillea
robusta trees that were mulched and minimum tilled had most soil moisture available in the shallower
layers, during the wettest and the driest season on which this paper is based; (ii) the variation of soil
moisture with distance from the Grevillea robusta trees showed patterns that were quite similar for plots
with root pruned trees in the dry and the wet season; (iii) beans had greater seed yields and maize had
more (stover) biomass and (only in the wettest season) grain in plots with pruned trees, minimum tilled
and mulched, than in other AF plots. In the wettest season this resulted in identical maize yields but
lower bean seed yields compared to those in the mulched and sometimes also the local control plots
without trees. In the driest season bean yields remained the same but maize biomass yields improved
above the control yields for the most successful agroforestry intervention applied; (iv) competition
between the six year old Grevillea robusta trees and the crops was indirectly confirmed to be stronger
than in earlier experiments in the same plots. This way the agroforestry demonstration plots were very
successful in showing the consequences of the ageing agroforestry system, where the soil moisture
conservation measures of pruning and mulching kept their effects. Statistical analysis only weakly
confirmed the positive effect of root pruning on reducing competition for soil moisture between crops
and trees that were very clearly shown to exist by the physical error analysis";"Otengi, SBB

Before then, Kenya was considered an icon, a bastion of political stability and economic prosperity in Africa. It surprised many that this icon would go up in flames so fast. Analyses of what went wrong with Kenya tend to gloss over the land question and ethnicity as factors behind the violence. Yet ethnicity and the manner in which the land question in the former white highlands and especially in the Rift Valley region has been addressed throughout the post-colonial period played an important role in the post-2007 election violence. This contribution argues that the reforms pursued through the settlement schemes and the land purchase programme by successive governments ethnicised the land question and established a ground for political conflict. It also shows that by looking at Kenya's politics of access to the former white highlands this violence becomes predictable. The discussion concludes that political leaders have not been keen to address the land question and it therefore remains a hot spot that, unless addressed in a democratic manner, may well ignite recurrence of violence";"Kanyinga, Karuti";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"University of Nairobi";"2009-12-31";"en";"land rights";"";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/38899";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/38899/Abstract.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/38899/Abstract.pdf.jpg?sequence=9&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Kenya;Violence;Land;Ethnicity;2007 election";""
"uonbi:11295/20990";"Environmental impacts of some scenarios of land-use Change: a gis assisted assessment of soil erosion hazard in The Mutirithia-Kariunga area of Laikipia District, Kenya.";"";"Characterizing soil erosion hazard and its spatial variability is critical for maintaining
user confidence in planning soil- and water- conservation programmes and general
land-use management. Predicting the average rates of soil erosion for a combination
of specific soil and land-use types is vital. This is because such predictions form a
basis for providing guidelines for effective erosion control.
The purpose of this investigation was to examine the erosion effects of alternative
land-use practices in the Mutirithia-Kariunga area of Laikipia District, Kenya. Four
different resource management systems or land-use scenarios were investigated.
These were the base scenario representing the current state of land use in the study
area, the maize scenario which represented an annual crop production situation, the
maize-management scenario representing land use in the form of annual maize
cropping in combination with a mulching management option and finally a perennial
cropping scenario. The effect of each land-use scenario on annualised erosion rates
was then examined through simulation modelling on all fields of the study area. The
study then evaluated the effects of the latter three land-use scenarios i.e. the maize
scenario, maize-management scenario and the perennial scenario against each other
and against the current land use; the base scenario. The Universal Soil Loss Equation
of Wischmeier and Smith (1978) was employed to estimate annual erosion rates. The
Arc Info & IDRISI Geographical Information Systems (GIS) assisted with the
determination and mapping of the spatial distribution of impacts due to soil erosion
from the various land-use scenarios. Soil loss was then calculated for the study area
in cells or pixels with a true ground-size of 50 meters by 50 meters.
Results showed that the optimal resource management scenario which minimized net
annual erosion rates and maximized returns to land, labour and management consisted
of a scenario maintaining a perennial crop cover, i.e., the perennial scenario. This
, land-use scenario decreased total area erosion of regions experiencing an annualised
soil loss of over 10 tlha yr', by 145 times relative to a representative annual crop
scenario - the maize scenario. A soil loss tolerance of 10 tlha yr', is the standard
established for conservation compliance though this value may vary from place to
place depending on the depth of different soils. The perennial scenario also
decreased total area erosion by 3 times in comparison with a representative
x
management modified annual crop scenario, the maize - management scenario and 13
times relative to the base scenario.
The worst-case scenario was the maize scenario in which soil loss of over 10 tlha yr'
was experienced on over 70% of the study area. Apart from a standard flat tillage and
a previous incorporation of crop residue treatment for all the cases, this maizescenario
was without extra management. On introducing land management in form
of residue mulch at a rate of 2 tonslha to this maize scenario, the resultant maize -
management scenario experienced a substantial reduction in areal extent with respect
to places experiencing soil loss of over 10 tlha yr', Such areas reduced in extent to
cover only 3% of the study area - a reduction of over 65%. This improvement is also
evidenced by a comparative ""mere"" 3 times that the soil loss in the maizemanagement
scenario was over the best-case perennial scenario. The planting of a
low bushy perennial crop reduced the annual soil loss from over 97% of the study
area to less than 5 tlha yr', Furthermore, only three percent of the study area
experienced soil losses above the five tonnes per hectare value in this perennial
scenario.
Vital implications for achieving and maintaining sound soil management practices
arise from the results of this study. The conclusions drawn from the study results
indicate that land-use with greatest negative impact on the study area with respect to
soil erosion is annual cropping with no soil conservation. However, investment in
land management techniques such as mulching substantially reduced the soil loss
from cropping land. A vegetative cover of perennials on the other hand also greatly
reduced erosion. The reduction of soil erosion rate therefore absolutely requires
improved management on both perennial and annual croplands. Erosion will only be
eventually reduced through improved levels of technology and increased technical
knowledge of the farmers. It is recommended that planners move in rapidly to
prioritise erosion protection measures on those areas that have been identified to
suffer extremely higher erosion and take remedial action before they are rendered
completely useless. Specifically this would entail, improved land use management,
strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture extension activities, revision of district
wide development plans policies to reflect current and anticipated land use trends and
concerns of study area. This should be followed by educating the farmers of this area
on appropriate land management techniques using ongoing participatory planning
Xl
processes and developing public education and land use advocacy programmes, each
prescription being area specific due to differential rates of susceptibility to erosion.
On the other hand, the use of GIS tools to characterise annual soil loss potentially
offers great promise to expand quantitative databases. These tools provide
capabilities to provide vast information and knowledge to resource planners and land
managers in concise and informative map formats. The combined modelling and GIS
approaches allowed for rapid assessment of erosion hazard of the entire study area
with minimal data. This methodology was also flexible enough to rapidly simulate
different scenarios of land use, a feat that would take many years to achieve under
fieldwork conditions. The results of the study do not necessarily reflect the exact
amount of erosion that is occurring at specific sites of the study area but it does
provide planners with a guide showing areas that would require most attention from a
land management compliance standpoint. Much more confidence in the results would
only be achieved if consistent ground-truthing of the study results is undertaken. It is
recommended to scholars that validation of the model to this specific area is
necessary and would go a long way in developing models that can be used to
confidently and rapidly predict long-term soil loss relevant to this region. It is
specifically recommended that further research be conducted within an expanded
realm to encompass whole watersheds which will allow an understanding of region
level dynamics, that further spatial inventories of land and ecological resources be
undertaken and that much more accurate prediction models be built for this region and
be integrated with GIS.";"Adero, Macopiyo L";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2000-12-31";"en";"area;assessment;environment";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/20990";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/20990/Adero_Environmental%20impacts%20of%20some%20scenarios%20of%20land-use%20Change%3a%20a%20gis%20assisted%20assessment%20of%20soil%20erosion%20hazard%20in%20The%20Mutirithia-Kariunga%20area%20of%20Laikipia%20District%2c%20Kenya.?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/20990/Adero_Environmental%20impacts%20of%20some%20scenarios%20of%20land-use%20Change%3a%20a%20gis%20assisted%20assessment%20of%20soil%20erosion%20hazard%20in%20The%20Mutirithia-Kariunga%20area%20of%20Laikipia%20District%2c%20Kenya..jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Environmental impacts of some scenarios of land-use Change;The mutirithia-kariunga area of laikipia district, Kenya.";""

"uonbi:11295/73274";"Community participation in the rehabilitation of a sand dune environment in Kenya";"";"This study aims to document various community efforts in land rehabilitation and assess their potential. Data were captured using interviews and focus group with 150 community members. A public participation index was used to establish the extent of community efforts in land rehabilitation. The study revealed that in the absence of proper management and dune stabilisation, large areas covered with mobile sand dunes continue to be a threat to grazing lands in northern Kenya. In recognition of this threat, the people of North Horr have launched several initiatives to contain the problem. Environmental and non-environmental group members scored participation rates (PP) of 87·5 and 50%, respectively. These include tree planting on both communal and individual plots and the management of Suaeda monoica through natural regeneration. Although the survival rates of most planted trees on group plots were low, Azadirachta indica that were planted on individual homesteads appeared to be performing comparatively well. Natural regeneration of indigenous plant species such as Suaeda monoica has the potential to perform important economic and ecological functions. The study concludes that in order to effectively arrest the process of desertification on the pastoral drylands of northern Kenya and to restore productivity and biodiversity, it is important to take actions that incorporate both biophysical and human considerations. Linking sociology to ecology is thus paramount in any sustainable dune stabilisation (SDS) programme. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Olukoye, G A

"uonbi:11295/25750";"Impact of land use and cover change on soil quality and pasture productivity in semi-arid rangelands";"The case of Nakasongola district, Uganda";"The impact of land use and cover change on soil quality and pasture production was investigated
in the rangelands of Nakasongola District, Uganda, Landsat (TM) images of 1986 and 1990 and
Landsat (ETM+) of 2000 and 2004 for Nakasongola District were used to determine the extent
and patterns of land use and cover change using the Integrated Land and Water Information
Systems (ILWIS) 3.6 software. A modified-Whittaker sampling design was used to collect soil
and pasture samples in three land cover types (bare, herbaceous and woody) under three
production systems (settled, semi-settled and non-settled). The soil samples were analyzed for
selected chemical and physical properties while pasture samples were oven dried for biomass
yield. Analysis of variance, discriminant analysis and principle component analysis were
conducted using XL-Stat software to differentiate the sites and ascertain the effects of different
land cover and use types on soil properties. Multivariate analysis for 18 properties of soil was
conducted for physical (5), chemical ""(7), organic matter (3) and aggregate stability (3) for the
upper 15 ern of soil which were combined into a single general indicator of soil quality (GISQ).
The area covered by grassland decreased by 13.1% from 90,020 ha in 1986 to 78,199 ha in 2004.
Between 1986 and 1990, much of the grasslands were converted into bush land (38,608 ha),
woodland (19,659 ha) and cropland (9,159 ha) while between 1990 and 2000, 21,838, 5,912 and
4,506 ha of grassland were converted to woodland, cropland and bush land respectively and
between 2000 and 2004, 33,354, ha were converted to woodland, 12,029 ha to bush land and
6,114 to crop land. In general, bush and woody encroachment engulfed approximately 65%,50% and 54% of grasslands In the periods of 1986 - 1990, 1990 - 2000 and 2000 - 2004,
respectively.
Soils from bare land under non-settled production systems had significantly high levels of clay
(p<O.OOOl)and bulk density (p<0.02). Soil from herbaceous vegetation had significantly high
levels of organic matter and total nitrogen (p < 0.001) compared to woody and bare soils, while
soils from woody vegetation had significantly high levels of available Phosphorus (p < 0.04).
The semi-settled production system had high levels of pH (p < 0.04), Ca (p < 0.038) and CEC (p
< 0.001) compared to the settled and non-settled systems. Basing on chemical and physical ,
properties, soils from herbaceous vegetation were very distinct from those of bare ground but
were 72% similar to soils under woody cover.
When the equation for calculation of the General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) was
developed (GISQ = 0.015PHYSICAL + 0.02CHEMICAL + 0.0170RGANIC MATTER +
0.024AGGREGA TE STABILITY) and applied to all sites, GISQ was significantly affected by
production system (p < 0.05) and the interaction between production system and cover (p <
0.001). Herbaceous cover under semi-settled production systems had the highest GISQ of 0.64
that ranged from 0.41 - 1.00, while bare cover under non-settled systems had the lowest GISQ of
0.23 that ranged from 0.1 - 0.53. Most soils had lower levels of organic matter and soil nutrients
and thus the generally low GISQ.
Pasture biomass yield was significantly different between cover types (p < 0.0001), with high
biomass in herbaceous (2019 kglha) and least in bare. Production systems also had significantly different (p < 0.013) biomass yield, highest in settled (1266 kg/ha) and least in semi-settled (953
kg/ha). Biomass yield was more associated with high levels of OM (r = 0.91), Ca (r = 0.91), Mg
(0.83), N (r = 0.77) and base saturation \r = 0.88) and were therefore identified as the most
critical soil nutrients limiting pasture production.
The results indicated that the rate at which grassland cover is lost to other land use and cover
types is greater than the rate of grassland expansion meaning that grasslands are at the verge of
disappearing if no conservation measures are instituted to protect them. Grasslands have been
degraded to levels below their recuperative capacity and therefore rehabilitation back to
herbaceous cover would require more time and external investments. The soils in Nakasongola
are generally very strongly acidic (average of pH = 4.5) and therefore improving soil pH and
addition of organic matter are major soil management practices that should be undertaken to
increase pasture biomass yield in the degraded rangeland ecosystems. From this study, semisettled
production systems and herbaceous vegetation cover have been identified as the most
appropriate land use and cover types for 'the semi-arid rangelands of Nakasongola District in
terms of sustainable soil quality conservation and pasture production.";"Emmanuel, ZA";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2011-11-30";"en";"land use;rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/25750";"";"";"";"";"";"Soil quality;Pasture productivity;Semi-arid rangelands;Land use";""
"uonbi:11295/102854";"Influence of Miraa Cultivation on Changing Agricultural Land Use Patterns in Mbita and Kianjiru Locations, Embu County";"";"This study focuses on the influence of miraa (Catha edulis) production on land-use patterns in Mbeere South Sub-County, Embu County. It was borne out of the need to interrogate the phenomenon of invasive and unregulated land-use practices, particularly agricultural practices that have far-reaching spatial and socio-economic implications on livelihoods; and seek mechanisms to safeguard rural areas from negative consequences emanating from the same. The study endeavored to critically examine and understand the spatial facets of miraa farming in the study area with a view of providing an integrated and sustainable model for land use in the study area and in the country at large.
The study area was purposely sampled based on its role as the second largest miraa production area in the country after Nyambene Hills in Meru County. The study specifically focused on 10 sample villages in Mbita and Kirima Sub-Locations. The study partly involved critical analysis of theoretical underpinnings informing production of miraa from interrogation of literature and theories of land use and land cover. The study revealed that miraa production in the study area has occurred spontaneously and has continued to expand rapidly over the years, tending to dominate over other forms of production. The production has directly altered the land-use pattern through extensification and intensification of production and indirectly through multiplicationof human activities in the region. Further, the production has reconfigured human settlement patterns. On one hand, there is rapid concentration of population around the emerging commercial nodes that offer auxiliary services and double as miraa collection centres. On the other hand, there are scattered settlements around the miraa farms where actual production takes place. The main drivers of miraa production are its high commercial benefit, high market demand and the existence of an elaborate trade network.
As part of recommendations, the study proposes efficient land administration, fast tracking land-use planning universally, from the national to the local level and sectoral planning for agriculture development including planning for institutional changes so as to fully exploit the value chain of other agricultural products in the region. The study further proposes the regulation of miraa production through policy guidelines for provision of alternative sources of livelihoods and diversification of production.";"Mugendi, G M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/102854";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102854/Mugendi%2cG%20M_Influence%20of%20Miraa%20Cultivation%20on%20Changing%20Agricultural%20Land%20Use%20Patterns%20in%20Mbita%20and%20Kianjiru%20Locations%2c%20Embu%20County.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102854/Mugendi%2cG%20M_Influence%20of%20Miraa%20Cultivation%20on%20Changing%20Agricultural%20Land%20Use%20Patterns%20in%20Mbita%20and%20Kianjiru%20Locations%2c%20Embu%20County.pdf.jpg?sequence=6&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Influence of Miraa Cultivation on Changing Agricultural Land Use Patterns in Mbita and Kianjiru Locations, Embu County";""
"uonbi:11295/101567";"Exploring the Potentials of a Gis-based Street Addressing System in the Management of Land Rates. Case Study: Machakos Town";"";"A study on street addressing system reveals that there are several benefits associated with the system. In fact, it is one of the most feasible systematic efficient approaches for managing properties and locating places. A sizeable sample of planning authorities in developed countries have applied successfully street addressing to manage cities, towns and urban areas. Addressing allows for effective revenue management, ease of navigation (way finding), identification of various properties including business location, provision of utilities and ease of circulation of emergency services such as ambulances, fire and security services among other benefits. However, regardless of its numerous potentials, there has been little effort to apply this concept in revenue management by the County Governments in Kenya. Land rates are the most important sources of local revenue for the devolved government. This is because land is immobile therefore rates from land are a certain sustainable source.
Over the past five years, various counties have had challenging encounters in the management of land rates which have made the rating authorities issue waivers through print and visual media as a measure to lure defaulters in order to pay their arrears. This is an indication of management challenges perhaps due to lack of adequate information to make important managerial decisions and incorporation of technologies to track defaulters. About fifteen per cent of national budget funds is shared among 47 counties. These monies end up either in individual pockets, mismanaged and settling recurrent expenditure, leaving counties with the option of depending on locally generated revenue (inadequate) for development.
The study focused on codifying streets and assigning addresses to land parcels (unique identifiers) within Machakos town (study area), did a comprehensive land rates inventory register using a GIS-based street addressing in the study area, and designed a GIS geo-database of street address index and land rates inventory. All this was done with the overall objective of designing a GIS-based Street addressing system and demonstrating its potentials in the management of land rates within the study area. Addressing helps in precise location of properties. Indeed, addition of the geo-spatial information component to the properties will enhance Machakos rating department and County Government at large to collect more rates through an improved revenue management system. The expandability and sustainability nature of GIS-based addressing system should allow Machakos County also to roll out the system to other towns and urban centres to improve on service provision, development and urban planning in the County. This system can be replicated in other counties as well.";"Muinde, Sammy M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/101567";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/101567/Muinde%2cSammy%20M_Exploring%20the%20Potentials%20of%20a%20Gis-based%20Street%20Addressing%20System%20in%20the%20Management%20of%20Land%20Rates.%20Case%20Study-Machakos%20Town.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/101567/Muinde%2cSammy%20M_Exploring%20the%20Potentials%20of%20a%20Gis-based%20Street%20Addressing%20System%20in%20the%20Management%20of%20Land%20Rates.%20Case%20Study-Machakos%20Town.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Exploring the Potentials of a Gis-based Street Addressing System in the Management of Land Rates";""

Using Michuki Memorial Park as a case study, the study sought to assess dynamics of urban land space contestation and their implications on utilization of public green spaces. The study found that public urban green spaces have increasingly been threatened by competing urban land uses for control hence their quality over time has deteriorated thus denying city residents access to the much needed recreation and leisure areas. Catalysed by lack of a consolidated policy framework for urban green spaces in Kenya, the existing loopholes in policy have resulted to their vulnerability and dilapidation. Further the study reveals that proper planning, management and utilization of the Park can be mainstreamed into policy and practice when factors associated with their positive utilization are incorporated in its planning and design. In addition, any Park mainstreaming program in policy and practice is pegged on adequate financial support, political good will, involvement of all and access to information as well as a robust enforcement agency. Hence the study recommends formulation of urban green spaces policy framework for their planning and sustainable management. It further recommends strengthening strict adherence to land use development controls, optimizing on Park users satisfaction, promoting urban eco-tourism through revitalization of green spaces advocating public private partnerships, payment of parks services and other Park funding options as well as inculcating robust green spaces collaborative governance.";"Naibei, Peter N";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2018-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/104931";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/104931/Naibei_Dynamics%20Of%20Urban%20Land%20Space%20Contestation%20And%20Their%20Implications%20On%20Utilization%20Of%20Public%20Green%20Spaces.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/104931/Naibei_Dynamics%20Of%20Urban%20Land%20Space%20Contestation%20And%20Their%20Implications%20On%20Utilization%20Of%20Public%20Green%20Spaces.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Urban Land Space Contestation";""

The study established that the importance of land ownership hinges on socio-economic and political considerations especially in developing countries such as Kenya. Land enables one to have security mainly in terms of access to credit. It can be utilized for both, economic and subsistence purposes. To some people, land gives power and prestige. Indeed, land ownership has been a true manifestation, of power and wealth in Kenya. This myth has been fueled by the rampant land grabbing, misallocation and other underhand dealings by those with administrative, political and economic powers.
Unfortunately, this is carried out at the expense of the weaker sections of the society in general, and in particular mainly at the expense of the poor. To make matters worse, the laws governing real property that should be employed as a solution, have been found by a section of legal experts to be archaic, outdated, retrogressive and alien. The introduction of the individual land tenure system translated into a tenure arrangement based on an indefeasible title and not use. Registration process has not given individual title holders the security and power to deal with their land.
Key components of Draft National Land Policy were examined, analyzing why, in many respects, informal systems work better than formal ones and suggesting some ways in which this might inform improvements to land administration. The main focus was on property rights (tenure, registration and titling), although use regulation, direct public participation in the land market and infrastructure provision were also of importance.";"Nzomo, Patrick, S";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2008-12-31";"en";"development;land registration";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/96667";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/96667/Nzomo%20Patrick%20S_An%20Investigation%20Into%20Land%20Registration%20Process%20and%20Its%20Effects%20on%20Urban%20Land%20Development.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/96667/Nzomo%20Patrick%20S_An%20Investigation%20Into%20Land%20Registration%20Process%20and%20Its%20Effects%20on%20Urban%20Land%20Development.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"An Investigation Into Land Registration Process and Its Effects";""

This study examines an intervention strategy to reduce the risk of chromium (Cr) exposure. It follows a previous Cr exposure investigation, which revealed that large volumes of Cr-contaminated waste were burnt on site. The study site had a long history of land-based waste disposal since 1994.

Objective. The potential for phytoremediation using bamboo species to restore Cr-contaminated soil was evaluated.

Methods. Chromium levels and physico-chemical properties of the tannery and control soils were analyzed before transplanting six different bamboo species. Translocation, bio-concentration and bioaccumulation factors of the species were assessed for phytoremediation capabilities.

Results. Chromium levels in the tannery soils ranged from 1337.0 to 3398.0 mg/kg dw. The chromium levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the control soils (0.20 to 2.34 mg/kg dw) and markedly exceeded the recommended limit of 100 mg/kg dw. The physicochemical properties of the tannery soils were also significantly varied (P < 0.05) compared to the control soils. In all cases, the species grown in the tannery soils were tolerant to a wide range of prevailing conditions. All of the bamboo species in the present study had a 100% survival rate in the tannery soils, except for D. birmanicus, which had a survival rate of 83.3%. Moreover, growth performance of the species in the tannery and control soils as evaluated by height and clump diameters did not vary significantly (P > 0.05). However, Cr levels in the tannery differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the species and rhizosphere soils. D. asper, B. vulgaris, D. membranaceus and B. blumeana had a bio-concentration factor (BCF) > 1 and translocation factor (TF) < 1, indicating that they are suitable for phytostablization. On the contrary, B. bambos had a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) < 1 and TF > 1, indicating potential for phytoextraction, while D. birmanicus showed no potential for phytoextraction or phytostabilization.

Conclusions. The present study identified D. asper, B. vulgaris, D. membranaceus and B. blumeana as suitable for restoration of Cr-contaminated tannery sites. Close monitoring of toxic metals is necessary during application of these species. Further studies are also recommended using a wide variety of bamboo species to optimize their application in phytoremediation.

The historical perspectives of the land question in Kenya are outlined, and the factors that shaped the content of Kenya's land law and attendant institutional and constitutional regimes are addressed. The operationalization of the legal regimes and policy frameworks emergent from the colonial legacy is also extensively dealt with, focusing on the way the state has sought to balance private and public interests in land through the instruments of law. Analyses of the interface between tenure, land use and environmental conservation are presented. The various theories and paradigms of land related development are reviewed. Pertinent issues that need due attention in the process of land reform are identified.

Marsabit forest, Kenya";"";"The Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR), a green island in an arid environmental setting, generates multiple ecosystem goods and services (ES) to the local community critical for their livelihoods. The forest has been experiencing substantial land conversion for town expansion, agriculture production and settlements threatening long-term ES provision. Sustaining the forest ES under increasing anthropogenic pressures is one of the great challenges of the Marsabit forest community. We used focus group discussions in the thirteen locations around the forest and individual key informant's interviews in the identification of drivers of change and their potential impacts on ES in MFR. We used the scenario development process (SDP) in coming up with four divergent but plausible exploratory scenarios. The study established that the main ES provided by the forest was, water, fuelwood, forage (dry season grazing resource), medicinal plants and timber for construction. Stakeholders identified population pressure, unsustainable utilisation of forest resources, institutional barriers to effective resource management, land use and climate change as the main drivers impacting ES provision in the forest. Land use change and climate change were considered the most significant drivers yet the most uncertain in the future impacting ES provision in the MFR. The SDP identified four alternative future scenarios for the MFR by the year 2044 with the Marsabit we want scenario identified as the most desirable future for the sustainable supply of ES with adequate adaptation to observed changes. Stakeholders came up with a joint action plan implementation matrix for the identified scenario while mitigating the negative aspects of the alternative scenarios. The results support the need for participatory land use planning that takes into to account the growing threat of climate change to natural forest systems.";"Olago, Daniel

However, enclosure benefits cannot be generalized as there are variations across dryland ecosystems and societies. This study assessed the qualitative and quantitative benefits derived from rehabilitating degraded rangelands using private enclosures in Chepareria, West Pokot County, Kenya. Dry-season grazing reserves, healthier livestock, improved livestock productivity, easier livestock management, food security, reduced animal losses, ecosystem services, land ownership, independence and improved standard of living were the main qualitative benefits from private enclosures identified. Quantitative benefits were manifested through various enclosure enterprise combinations, sale of enclosure marketable products and adoption of alternative income generating activities. They included the sale of livestock and livestock products, maize, wood cutting, grass cuttings, contractual grazing, grass seeds, poultry products, fruits and honey, amongst others. Livestock production directly accounts for 42·4% of the total enclosure income and is the main source of livelihood in Chepareria. There was a significant trend of increasing total enclosure income with enclosure acreage (p ≤ 0·05) while enclosure age was insignificant. Enclosures cushion households against climatic shocks such as drought by providing additional flexibility in land, fodder, livestock management and the uptake of various income generating activities. We conclude that enclosures have the potential of contributing to resilience as attested from the benefits reported in this study. However, private enclosure tradeoffs such income differentiation, reduced communal land and conflict have implications on how the ecological and socio-economic aspects may be impacted as the establishment of private enclosures in Chepareria continues.

"uonbi:11295/100125";"Land Use Practices And Their Impacts On Wise Use And Conservation Of The Tana Delta Wetland";"";"Globally, wetlands are under serious threat from the continuous reclamation due to demand to
satisfy human development needs. Wetlands are the worlds’ most productive environment and
rich in biological diversity of plants and animals. Wetlands provide many ecosystem services to
humans and the environment ranging from fresh water, food, regulation of climate, coastal
protection, regulation of floods, tourism and recreational activities, and water purification.
Despite the mounting recognition of the need to protect wetlands, many continue to be
overexploited sometimes resulting to their total loss.
Wetland ecosystems in Kenya similarly face serious threats of degradation. This is mainly
caused by conversion of wetlands for agriculture and industrial use and high population directly
dependent on natural resources coupled with poor wetlands regulation. The situation is also
worsened by lack of funding and the active participation of the people in the controlling of the
various resources in the wetland regions, unplanned developments in wetland areas, and lack of a
working National Wetlands Policy and crosscutting sectoral laws.
The Tana River Delta is among the most important wetlands in Kenya listed as a Wetland of
International Importance under the Ramsar Convention; however, various land uses, either
proposed or ongoing are not consistent with the wise use and conservation of the wetland
ecosystem. Large-scale commercial land uses remain the biggest threat to the Tana River Delta
wetland.
The purpose of the research was to study the environmental impact of land utilization practices
in the Tana Delta wetland, assess the compatibility of the land uses with the principal of wise
use, and recommend necessary mitigation measures.
The study was conducted in villages of Kulesa, Wema, and Hewani in Minjila area of Garsen in
the Tana Delta. The local leaders totaling 23 and 9 key informants were selected through the
purposive sampling method. Data was gathered from the local leaders and the key informants
through focus group discussion and in-depth interviews respectively.
The findings of the study are that: the land use in the Tana Delta is not consistent with wise use
and sustainable utilization of the Tana Delta resources. Some of the land uses include conversion
of large tracks of land for rice irrigation, diversion of the river through a canal from Kitere area
to a rubber dam at Sailoni, the creation of 43-kilometer long dyke affecting the hydrological
cycle of the flood plain. It has also led to the involuntary displacement of people, loss of habitat
for water birds and wildlife, over abstraction of water, and conflicts over resources.";"Abdullahi, Garane A";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-12-31";"en";"land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/100125";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100125/Abdullahi%20_Land%20Use%20Practices%20And%20Their%20Impacts%20On%20Wise%20Use%20And%20Conservation%20Of%20The%20Tana%20Delta%20Wetland.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100125/Abdullahi%20_Land%20Use%20Practices%20And%20Their%20Impacts%20On%20Wise%20Use%20And%20Conservation%20Of%20The%20Tana%20Delta%20Wetland.pdf.jpg?sequence=11&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Land Use Practices And Their Impacts On Wise Use And Conservation Of The Tana Delta Wetland";""

per capita
food availability poses challenges to overcoming land
degradation and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a need to identify ways of improving land
productivity particularly among smallholders. This study investigated the contribution of integrated soil
fertility management (ISFM) practices to both technical and allocative efficiencies in the maize farming
system of Kenya. To determine efficiency gains from ISFM, we compared efficiencies of two groups of
smallholders: those within the contact areas and their counterfactuals. We estimated Cobb-Douglas
stochastic functions based on maize production data collected from a stratified sample of 373 farmers.
The results indicate that farmers who applied ISFM were more efficient both technically and allocatively
than those who did not. Application of ISFM practices increased technical and allocative efficiencies by
26 and 30%, respectively
.
However, other favourable factors are required for farmers to realize
maximum efficiency gains from maize farming activity. They included farming experience, extension
contacts, off-farm income and market access. Therefore, policies and practices aimed at enhancing
farming efficiency in smallholder
agriculture should address these factors. We recommend increased
dissemination of ISFM technologies to the wider farming community through effective and participatory
approaches to increase efficiency and enhance farm returns.";"Mutoko, Morgan C

Nguruman sub-catchment in the northern part of Kajiado County has experienced rapid land use and land cover changed over the past decades. However, the extent to which these changes have impacted on the ecosystem and indigenous livelihoods has not been assessed. This remains a critical challenge that must be addressed due to its potential severe impacts on rural human livelihoods especially in arid and semi-arid areas in Kenya. This study aimed at assessing the effects of LULCC from 1994 to 2014 on the indigenous livelihoods in Nguruman sub-catchment. In order to achieve a positive gain in management, the study aimed at investigating available options to engage the indigenous community in identifying and finding solutions to issues on management of land and water resources in the study area. An integrated approach combining
LANDSAT image analysis, household surveys using questionnaires, Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) and Participatory GIS (PGIS) was employed in the study. This approach allowed conceptualizing LULCC from both a scientific and an indigenous community perspective. Household surveys and FGDs were conducted in Entasopia, Pakasse, Nguruman, Musenge and Shompole locations. Significant land use changes (p<0.05) were recorded in cropland, open water, open grasslands and bareland. Areas occupied by croplands increased significantly and forestland reduced. There were fluctuations in areas occupied by wetlands in the form of swamps (vegetated wetlands) and open water (rivers, ponds and lakes). The fluctuation in the two land covers showed similar trends with both increasing between 1994 and 2014 and reductions between 2004 and 2014 reported. Areas occupied by open water increased significantly (p<0.05) by 1.15% (1994-2014). Significant (p<0.05) reduction in bareland was also recorded between 1994 and 2014. Open grasslands increased significantly (p<0.05) while wooded grasslands reduced though this was not significant. Expansion of cropland has been identified as the main driving force of land use changes in Nguruman sub-catchment. This implies that more land is being converted to cropland. The results of household surveys and PGIS analysis demonstrated that the residents are aware of the dynamics and causes of LULCC. Majority of the respondents (67%, n=204) linked the changes to an expansion in cropland while 31% and 2% associated the change to an expansion in open grassland and forestland respectively. Significant expansion (p < 0.05) in irrigated cropland was observed in both Pakasse and Entasopia sub-locations between 1994 and 2014. Results from household surveys reveal that there has been a sudden shift from a traditional pastoral livelihood to extensive agro-pastoral practices. This poses a critical challenge on both rural livelihood and will consequently have negative consequence on the current and future sustainability of the ecosystem. Additionally, expansion of irrigated cropping which has become a major economic activity in the study area will continue to exert more pressure on the scarce water resources in the catchment. Such pressure will be directed along the riparian land where availability of water suitable soil conditions for farming is guaranteed. There is need to identify and implement best management practices to sustainably manage land and water resources in Nguruman sub-catchment. This should involve all key stakeholders including local communities in identifying, designing and implementing sustainable strategies for land and water resources management in Nguruman sub-catchment.";"Malaki, Philista A";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2018-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/104130";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/104130/Malaki_Perceptions%20and%20knowledge%20on%20land%20use%20and%20land%20cover%20changes%20and%20impact%20on%20resources%20and%20livelihoods%20in%20Nguruman%20Sub-catchment%2c%20Kajiado%20County.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/104130/Malaki_Perceptions%20and%20knowledge%20on%20land%20use%20and%20land%20cover%20changes%20and%20impact%20on%20resources%20and%20livelihoods%20in%20Nguruman%20Sub-catchment%2c%20Kajiado%20County.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land use change;Community Perceptions;Participatory GIS;Nguruman catchment management";""

Rapid population growth and subsequent pressure on land raise the problem of how to increase and sustain agricultural production while at the same time conserving the natural resources (montane forest with Olea africana and Juniperus procera as main species at 2900 m asl.). Deterioration in soil physical and chemical properties following deforestation for agriculture can adversely affect crop production, especially from soils on mountain slopes. Appropriate conservation and management for sustainable use of such soils require monitoring the changes in their fertility. The effects of land clearing for potato cultivation and livestock grazing on the fertility of an Andosol (after 5 to 8 years) were investigated in the 0 to 10, 20 to 30 and 40 to 50 cm soil layers. Topsoil pH decreased significantly in the potato and grass plots, as did organic C, total N and available P.

trypanosomosis both spread by tsetse. This was a deterrent to human occupation despite the suitability of the land for most agriculrural practices. In order to encourage seftlement, concerted efforts by foreign donors and the Kenya government have seen a significant reduction in both human and animal trypanosomosis. Due to the proximity within which people have settled to the park and the abundance of wildlife, bush encroachment
is seen as a potential threat not only to the mainly grazer wildlife, but also to agricultural
development in the area, due to the challenge posed to livestock by the disease. Experiments to control tsetse by trapping and selective bush clearing began in 1935 (Wellde, 1989a). During the late sixties and early seventies, tsetse control was aimed at isolation of the tsetse-infested thickets within the park. Consequently, bush clearing
aerial spraying, ground spraying, traps and targets have all been applied principally in the
Park, with different aims and levels of success
(Davies, 1993). Despite the enormous scientific attention in this park owing to tsetse and its control, there has been no examination of trends in land cover, which are a main determinant of tsetse habitat,and are crucial in the sustenance of the wildlife,
the preferred tsetse host, and in the case of the Ruma park, are important to the survival of the roan antelope, the only herd in East and Central Africa. This study was therefore designed to examine the trends in land-cover change in the Park, and to assess the perception of the local inhabitants ofthe valley on the park and therefore explore potential conflict areas crucial to its survival.";"G.W, Muriuki

"uonbi:11295/95389";"Land Use Conflicts and opportunities in a Livestock Market: Case study of Garissa Market";"";"Livestock is a crucial source of financial capital for the rural poor. The arid and semi arid lands
are home to nearly 70% of the national herd with an estimated value of Kenya shillings 70
billion. For many, it is the only form of savings available. Therefore, its efficient production and
marketing is essential for sustaining pastoral livelihoods. The existing Garissa livestock market
in Central Division of Garissa District covers a total area of approximately 10 acres. It provides a
range of employment and income-earning opportunities. Despite its importance, its spatial size is
small compared to the large number of livestock that are traded through it thus leading to a spill
over effect to the neighbouroods and causing land use conficts.
This study determined the major land use conflicts of the existing Garissa livestock market,
estimated the population of livestock traded at the market by type and determined the appropriate
market size, design and location to optimize benefits and minimize negative impacts. It also
determined the social, economic and environmental impacts to its neighbourhoods and Garissa
town as a whole and has proposed intervention measures to ensure efficient marketing of
livestock and reduction of land use conflicts.
The first phase of the study involved literature review where information on livestock market
and livestock in general was reviewed. The second phase involved collection of secondary data
on animal diseases, economic, social and environmental impacts of the market and land uses.
The third phase involved collection of primary data where data was collected as it existed with
the source. After data collection, it was edited and analysed. Finally, a final report in the form of
maps, figures, photographs, tables and charts was produced.
The findings show that there is a permanent road that passes through the livestock market that
links the neighbourhoods to Garissa town. This road is mainly used by pedestrians and vehicular
traffic and is the main cause of accidents within the livestock market. The main livestock traded
in Garissa livestock market are cattle, goats, sheep, camels and donkeys. They have different
selling prices. The size of the market is inadequate and is not well designed and thus lacks most
of the facilities that are required by a livestock market. The market is the major source of
employment and income. It employs thousands of people ranging from livestock herders to
traders. Some government departments from Garissa County collect revenue from the market.
The main social impact is that it has improved on the diversity of the people. Intermarriages
between different communities and gaining knowledge from one another are also important
social impacts of the market. Negative social impacts include, cultural degradation and
insecurity. Some of the negative environmental impacts include, air and noise pollution and
spread of zoonotic diseases.
The main recommendations of the study include; Improvement on market facilities, closure of
the market road, provision of alternative parking areas outside the market, establishment of
livestock market management board, fencing and relocation of the existing market. Further
research can be carried out on modern ranching practices that can enhance livestock production
in Garissa county. Further research can also be carried out on the improvement of the road
infrastructure in Garissa County.";"Rashid, Hassan H";"";"";"University of Nairobi";"2014-07-31";"en";"land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/95389";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/95389/Rashid%20_Land%20Use%20Conflicts%20and%20opportunities%20in%20a%20Livestock%20Market%20Case%20study%20of%20Garissa%20Market.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/95389/Rashid%20Hassan%20H_Land%20Use%20Conflicts%20and%20opportunities%20in%20a%20Livestock%20Market%20Case%20study%20of%20Garissa%20Market.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land Use Conflicts";""
"uonbi:11295/107758";"An Assessment of Factors Influencing Smallholder Farmers’ Willingness to Adopt Mushroom Production for Livelihood Diversification in Vihiga County, Kenya";"";"Poverty is a critical problem in many parts of the world, especially in the developing countries. This has necessitated policy makers to have a keen interest in seeking ways of improving livelihoods and alleviating poverty. Agriculture remains a key sector for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and creating employment opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa. However, in areas where land acreage is small, it has become difficult to carry out any profitable agricultural production as a means of livelihood sustenance. There is need to identify enterprises that can be incorporated into the farmers’ production processes that are economically viable. There is limited research on the drivers and the extent of willingness of smallholder farmers’ to adopt mushroom production for livelihood diversification in Vihiga County in Western Kenya.
Using primary survey data from a sample of 240 smallholder farmers, this study assessed the factors that influence smallholder farmers’ willingness to adopt mushroom production as a livelihood diversification option in Vihiga County. Systematic sampling was used to select the respondents, where every 3rd and 5th household was interviewed in sparsely and densely populated areas, respectively to ensure that each household had an equal opportunity at being interviewed. Densely populated areas were mostly found around shopping centres and near tarmac roads. Descriptive statistics used in data analysis included frequencies, percentages and means and they were presented in graphs and tables. These were employed in the characterization of farmers’ socio-economic profiles. A binomial logit model was applied to assess the factors that influence awareness of mushroom production by the farmers in the study area and their willingness to adopt mushroom production as a livelihood diversification option.
Results show that 68.8% of the farmers in the study area were aware of mushroom production and 82.5% of the total respondents were willing to engage in mushroom production as a livelihood diversification option. From the logit analysis, the main factors that were found to have a significant positive influence on farmers’ willingness to engage in mushroom production were age, gender, consumption of mushroom and total land size in acres per household.
Based on the results, it is recommended that the stakeholders in the agricultural sector in the study area begin awareness campaigns of mushroom production as a livelihood diversification option for smallholder farmers in the region. It is also recommended that mushroom production be included in the County’s agricultural strategy. A training strategy on mushroom production could be enhanced by encouraging the farmers to be members of development groups. This is because the development groups are the main channel for information access on new agricultural production practices in the study area. The Agricultural Sector Development Support Programme (ASDSP) in the study area should allocate more funds for awareness campaigns and trainings to ensure that the farmers in the area have knowledge on mushroom production as a livelihood diversification option.

Land is a pertinent source of livelihood, the problem has persisted and in a number of years caused chaos as people grow impatient. Over time, there have been complaints from various communities and recently, the past governments have sought to listen to the ailing communities. The National Land Policy and the National Land Commission characterize efforts to remedy the continued situation bedeviling the African communities. A prominent feature of the problem was the sudden change of the existing mode of land ownership, whereby in Africa land was a communal property, to an individual situation whereby the rich could get more than the poor and the community’s comment about it would be met with deafening silence.
Since the passing of the 2010 Constitution, the issue of land and the prospect of land reforms has been reignited. However, this time around, it has come with a heightened level of hope given the immense power given to the National Land Commission by the National Land Commission Act of 2012. In fact, the commission has the power to repossess disused land, control land use, and settle squatters. Such has been the major problems facing Kenyans since independence. With the new laws and the purposefulness shown by agencies given the power to manage land, there is hope on the eventuality of utterly settling the land question.";"Mulevu, Eric";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/102183";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102183/Mulevu_A%20Critical%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Extent%20to%20Which%20the%20National%20Land%20Commission%20Addresses%20the%20Land%20Question%20in%20Kenya..pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102183/Mulevu_A%20Critical%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Extent%20to%20Which%20the%20National%20Land%20Commission%20Addresses%20the%20Land%20Question%20in%20Kenya..pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"National Land Commission Addresses";""

For this reason substantial investments have been made in research to improve agricultural technologies in various parts of the world, from the development of new crop varieties to new practices of land management. This paper explores the impact of land rights among other factors on adoption of soil and water conservation practices. The study further tests for Boserup's hypothesis (correlation between population density, land conservation and property rights) using panel survey data collected from farming households. The key findings of the paper are that property right regimes and population density affect both the decision to conserve land as well as the type of conservation practices used by farmers. The results further suggest a positive correlation between land tenure security and population density, thus supporting Boserup's hypothesis. The findings call for pursuit of both short-term and long-term policy measures that offer incentives for land conservation through government initiatives and participation of local communities.";"Kabubo-Mariara, Jane";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2007-10-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/48214";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/48214/Abstract.PDF?sequence=2&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/48214/Abstract.PDF.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land conservation;Tenure security;Population density;Kenya";""
"uonbi:11295/73813";"Evaluation of the Economic Net Benefits of the various fields found on a smallholder farming system in Vihiga-Kenya";"";"Strong gradients of decreasing soil fertility are found with increasing distance from the homestead within smallholder farms in Vihiga-Kenya. Nutrient use efficiency varies strongly between fields along these gradients of soil fertility. There is continuous accumulation of nutrients in areas around the homestead at the expense of nutrient depletion in further and larger fields. Unequal distribution of nutrients on the farm causes differences in yield with more yields being obtained in some areas on the farm than others. This has affected the overall crop yield and general wellbeing of the households on the smallholder farm. This study therefore undertook an evaluation of the economic benefits of the various fields belonging to smallholder farmesr. This was an effort to recommend strategies aimed at improving soil fertility levels to nutrient deficient fields. The objective of the study was to determine Economic Net Benefits across the fields on smallholder farms in Jinja and Vihiga. A division of the smallholder land into three farm portions of Near House (NH), Mid Farm (MF) and Far Farm positions with respect to distance from the homestead was done. An onion design layout was adopted to refer to these reference points. A household survey was administered to 76 households from in Vihiga. Using data on the gross margins collected from farmers, the Economic Net Benefits of various fields found on smallholder farms were calculated. Data was analysed using SPSS version 14. T test analysis showed a high significant difference of P≤0.001 in Economic Net Benefits between the (NH and MF) and (MF and FF) positions. Differences in Economic Net Benefits across the farm as a result of differences in soil fertility occasioned by unequal resource allocation might have implications in the economic as well as nutritional wellbeing of the household members. Appropriate intervention therefore need be instituted.";"Munialo, S

rates and related soil physical properties of the semi-arid
Sirima and Hukogodo catchments in Laikipia district were
investigated. Representative six soils in Sirima and four
soils in Hukogodo, surveyed at detailed level, were assessed.
Within soil types, four site condition treatments with respect
to vegetation cover and land use designated as Tr_ee/Bush _(TB),
Open Grass (OG), Bare Ground (BG) and Cultivated Surface (CS)
were studied. Infiltration rates were measured during a dry
and a wet season by a double cylinder infiltrometer. The top
three soil horizons bulk density, saturated hydraulic
conductivity, organic carbon, texture, antecedent water
content and water retention were also investigated .
In each catchment, within horizons, all the soil physical
parameters except texture were consistently significantly
different (p<.05) among site conditions; but rarely among
soils. Also, within soils among site conditions, the surface
horizon physical parameters exhibited significant differences
(p<.05) more often than those of subsurface horizons.
Infiltration rates were significantly different (p<.05)
among soils and site conditions in both catchments. The

difference among soils in Sirima was due to the occurence of
vertic and non-vertic ~oils; while in Hukogodo it was due to
the occu'ren ce of so iIs formed in situ and those deve loped from
alluvial material. Among site conditions, in both areas and
seasons, intake rates were highest under TB, intermediate on
OG and lowest on BG. Cultivation temporarily increased
infiltration rates above those of TB sites, however, due to
clod collapse and subsequent high susceptibility to surface
sealing , most of the increase was eliminated within a short
period.

multiple regression as significant in influencing variation in
infiltration rates.Soil cracking and swelling in Sirima during
the dry and wet season respectively, partially obscured the
influence of the physical parameters on infiltration rates.
Consistently, Sirima soils retained more water than
Mukogodo soils at all suctions, but the later had more
available water. In both areas, BG surface soils retained
significantly (p<.05) less water and also held the least
amount of available water. Cultivation reduced water
retention of surface soils, but had no significant influence

Using Kenya as an example, it is demonstrated that current constitutional arrangements put excessive emphasis on the protection of private property rights without requiring the corresponding duty of ecological stewardship. This has resulted in the failure of government policies and development practices to fully integrate environmental considerations into growth strategies. The linkages between governance and natural resource management are examined, and the relationship between land tenure and the management of soils, water, forests and wildlife is analysed. The strengths and weaknesses of current tenure systems are explored and alternative approaches are suggested. A governance scheme that takes into account environmental management should be a central part of the constitutional order. Traditional or customary land use practices already embody ecological principles which should be recognized by the law and reflected in constitutions. Options for constitutional reform are presented. These include the use of doctrines of public trust and customary use, and provisions which acknowledge the rights of nature, so that a balance is created between private property rights and public interest.";"Juma, Calestous

This paper combines two complementary data sets obtained from two locations in Kenya, drawn against distinctively different land availability patterns, to examine the diverse rural asset base and key sources of livelihood in the rural areas. The analysis reveals that while access to productive land is still an important determinant of livelihoods in the rural areas, even where land holdings are very small, growth in farm productivity alone may not guarantee households sufficient incomes to escape poverty. We find evidence to suggest that growth of non-farm sector is necessary and may be much more important in reducing risks and vulnerability to poverty and should be equally emphasized if households in such regions are to escape poverty. Off-farm earnings accounted for at least 50 percent of total household incomes in the two research locations. The study further revealed existence of significant barriers to entry to remunerative livelihoods both at farm and off-farm level. The study advocates for expansion of educational services, infrastructure and strengthening of rural institutions to spur broad-based development in the rural areas.";"Karugia, J T

"uonbi:11295/14558";"Use of GIS to manage community-based land transactions: Case Study: Kirinyaga Central District";"";"The elements of Land Administration in Kenya are very fragmented and independently operated
within the Ministry of Lands. During institutional reform there is opportunity to provide a much
more integrated Land Administration service to the citizens, especially at the district level
through the formation of ‘one-stop-shops’, through the integration and rationalization of the
existing land administration and land rights delivery systems.
This project report highlights the benefits offered through the application of GIS in management
of community based land transactions. Applying GIS technology in the management of land
transactions enables information to be managed more effectively and productively, and therefore
providing the opportunity to undertake new tasks. Improvements are shown in the capture,
storage, accuracy, completeness, integration, maintenance and analysis of data, which
consequently improves the quality and dissemination of information. However, GIS has complex
software systems, which require experience and expertise to utilize effectively. Customizing GIS
provides a solution, by offering user friendly interface for the operations and functions of a GIS,
which reduce the skills required for obtaining their output.
The study involved assessment of land transactions operations in Survey and Land Registration
departments of the Ministry of Lands, in Kirinyaga Central District. The results of this
assessment and the user needs and requirements established, were used to the development of
this system.
The project objectively addressed the land issues through development of a GIS database that
the community can use to find relevant land information. The database gives information about
qualified professionals within the district as well as land buyers and sellers by querying the
database. This is aimed at eliminating quacks who act as land surveyors or land management
agents. The database allows spatial data analysis for instance, deriving a suitability map about
land parcels locations according to requirements of the interested buyer or seller. The system
answers queries on land information on parcels based on the user needs.
The digital map database was developed through manual digitization process of analogue maps
that involved: Entering the spatial data, Entering the attribute data, Spatial and attribute data
verification, and linking the spatial to the attribute data. The results were analyzed through
querying of the database and derivative mapping for generation of the suitability maps based on the user needs and requirements.";"Mbui, John K";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2009-12-31";"en";"land transactions";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/14558";"";"";"";"";"";"Community land;GIS";""

Embu and Taita benchmark sites in Kenya with
relation to land use practices was investigated. The
study areas were chosen because of their significant
land use intensification and for being biodiversity hot
spots. Soil washing and dilution plate techniques were
used to recover Trichoderma spp from the soil samples
collected from different land use types. The fungal
isolates were identified and assigned to nine species
from Embu soils and eleven species from the Taita
soils. Greater populations were observed in Embu than
in Taita. Geographic differences between the regions
explained the differences in ecological niches of the
two regions that result to different soil assemblages
and plant types in the regions and therefore variation
in available substrate for the fungus. Land use at each
site affected the distribution, richness and abundance
of Trichoderma with napier grass having the highest
abundance in both Embu and Taita while coffee had
the lowest richness and abundance. Trichoderma
favoured plants with shallow and widely spreading
rooting systems, compared to the deeply rooted
perennial coffee and tea trees. This underpins the
importance of plant type and in effect land use system
in the abundance of Trichoderma. The unevenness in
the distribution of Trichoderma within the LUTs
suggested that other factors influenced the distribution
of Trichoderma apart from the LUTs. Unevenness was
greater in Embu than in Taita. The differences could
mostly be attributed to soil management practices
employed by different farmers while managing their
land and crops. Trichoderma harziunum was the most
frequently isolated species and the most abundant in
both Embu and Taita. Presence of Trichoderma
species in some land use types and absence in others,
provided a clue on the most preferred habitats, plants
and/or crops. Considering the beneficial aspects of
Trichoderma such as being antagonistic to the
pathogenic fungi, crops or plants such as napier grass
that induce high abundance and richness of Trichoderma can be used in crop rotations or in
combinations with other crops to maintain high levels
of the fungus in the soil.";"Okoth, Sheila A.

Location of Meru North district of Kenya. It comes at a time when Kenyans are
pressurizing the government increasingly to issue title deeds not only at the Coast
province but also all over the country (GoK -Ministry of Lands). Maua Location is of
concern owing to the fact that the land registration process has been on going since
1966. This is a long time (43 years) for the land registration process not to have been
completed, hence the researcher's interest in the location. Other regions of the country
where land registration has taken long include the Coastal region of Kenya, the Rift
Valley and Nyanza provinces as opposed to central and western provinces where this
delay was not experienced as it was done immediately after independence. (From 1994
to 1997, the Location has been subdivided into six locations, thus; Antobochiu-1994,
Luluma-1997, Kithetu-1997, Miori-1997, Nguyuyu-1994 and Maua-1994). For purposes
of this research, all these locations are combined into one and referred to as Maua
Location (See figure 4). Landowners have not yet received their title deeds and this
delay has occasioned economic, social, political, and environmental problems. This
study examines the different factors that have affected the land registration process
such as politics and governance, contradictory policies and institutional framework.
Study objectives are identification of relationships between current land policies and the
pace of land registration, determination of whether the current land dispute resolution
p
methods are related to incidences of land cases and identification of the relationship(s)
between land subdivision and environmental degradation in the Location.
The study shows how introduction of modern land dispute resolution methods as
opposed to traditional methods has impacted on the land registration process. This
research examines the environmental parameters associated with land registration in
Maua Location, and then offers solutions and recommendations to policy makers and
others on how to address the issues resu-.lting from land registration in the location. The study consists of five chapters. The background in Chapter 1 is on various legislations
that were introduced by the colonial administration (to replace customary land tenure)
v
and adopted at independence for land registration and their various shortcomings. The
chapter contains Statement of the research problem, justification of the research,
literature review, and objectives of the study, the hypotheses and the conceptual
framework. The scope and limitations of the study is also contained in this chapter.
Climate and topography, population, temperature, resource potential, vegetation, winds
and relative humidity of the study area are addressed in Chapter 2.
The methodology in Chapter 3 included Stratified random sampling and direct
observations. Data was from both primary and secondary sources; and was of
quantitative nature. Structured questionnaires were administered to the different
respondents and focused group discussions were held. On the other hand, specific
quantitative techniques of data analysis using SPSS such as Cross Tabulation and the
non- parametric Chi- square (X2) test were used. The contributions of this research are
highlighted in the findings which are presented in graphs, tables and pie .charts. In
conclusion in Chapter 5, the study shows that conflicts resulting from institutions
dealing with land matters are resolvable in nature with a positive effect on the pace of
land registration and modern methods of dispute resolution leading to high incidences
of land disputes. The pace of land registration also affects environmental
conservation; registered land owners want to protect their land from natural and
artificial disasters and politicians tend to cause delays in land registration.";"Ogega-Siameto, Esther N";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2009-12-31";"en";"land registration;land tenure";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/20808";"";"";"";"";"";"Land tenure;Land registration";""

Fighting land degradation is essential to ensure the sustainable and long-term productivity of the habited semiarid lands. In Kenya, grass reseeding technology has been used to combat land degradation. However, despite the use of locally adapted perennial grass species namely Cenchrus ciliaris (African foxtail grass), Eragrostis superba (Maasai love grass) and Enteropogon macrostachyus (Bush rye) failure still
abound. Therefore, more land is still being degraded. The aim of this study was to determine the main factors which contribute to failures in rehabilitating denuded patches in semi-arid lands of Kenya. A questionnaire was administered to capture farmer perceptions on failures on rangeland rehabilitation using grass reseeding technology. Rainfall data was collected during the study period. Moreover, rehabilitation trials using the three grasses were done under natural rainfall. Results from this study show that climatic factors mainly low amounts of rainfall to be the main contributor to rehabilitation
failures. 92% of the respondents asserted that reseeding fails because of low rainfall amounts received in the area. The study area received a total of 324 mm of rainfall which was low compared to the average annual mean of 600mm. Reseeded trial plots also failed to establish due to the low amounts of rainfall received. This showed how low rainfall is unreliable for reseeding. Other factors namely destruction by the grazing animals, pests and rodents, flush floods, poor sowing time, poor seed quality, lack of enough seed and weeds also contribute to rehabilitation failures in semi-arid lands of
Kenya";"Mganga, Kevin Z.

This study assessed the impact of enclosure age and enclosure management on the vegetation composition in the Njemps Flats range unit, Lake Baringo Basin (Kenya). Six communal enclosures (13–23 years since establishment) and six private enclosures (3–17 years since establishment) were selected. Point-line transect and quadrat-based measurements were made of herbaceous cover, functional group relative abundance and standing crop inside the enclosures and in the adjacent open rangeland. Unpalatable forbs and sedges dominated the herbaceous vegetation of the degraded open rangeland. Informal semi-private land ownership reduced open rangeland degradation as shown by a higher cover of surviving annual grasses. Rangeland enclosure fostered regeneration of annual and perennial grasses, and significantly increased grass cover and standing crop. Private and communal enclosure management were equally successful in rehabilitating grass cover. Standing crop in the communal enclosures was fully recovered, but it was sub-optimal in all private enclosures reflecting recent grazing or grass cutting activities. The variability in rehabilitation success highlights the high potential of individual herders’ incentives to promote rangeland rehabilitation but also stresses the importance of more detailed characterisation and monitoring of the enclosure management decisions.";"Ranst, E.

that provide rapid and less expensive assessment of the impacts of land management on
surface runoff is critical in the management of soil and water resources. In this study, a
stratified sampling procedure was used to set up 51 runoff plots on representative land
use types on the three slope zones in the landscape. On each slope zone a completely
randomized design was utilized. Runoff measurements were done for 120 rainfall events
involving two rain seasons. Three rain gauges with one gauge on each slope zone were
used for rainfall measurements. Infiltration measurements were also conducted on all the
land use types using two single ring infiltrometers. Topsoil samples (20 em deep) were
collected from each runoff plot for laboratory soil spectral analysis.
One way analysis of variance was utilized to investigate the effects of land use types on
surface runoff in each slope zone. Calibration of soil spectral reflectance to mean
seasonal runoff was done using partial least squares (PLS) technique.
Results of the study showed that land use significantly (p=0.001) influenced runoff
generation in on all slope zones. There were differences in seasonal runoff generation
patterns in the lowlands due to the presence of saturated overland flow in the long rainy
season. Results show that runoff generation mechanisms significantly (p=0.001)
influenced surface runoff in the lowlands in the long rainy season.
There were no statistical differences at 5% level of significance among tillage treatments
in the uplands and midlands slope zones. However, runoff from conventionally tilled
areas showed the highest variation (Cv=109%).
There were good correlations (R2>0.70) between surface runoff and soil spectral
reflectance for both rain seasons. However, the model validation of the relationship for
short rains, 2001 had a coefficient of determination ofr2 = 0.54.

Soil samples for this study were collected from the College of
Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences (CAVS), field station. Soil
samples for the determination of bulk density, organic matter

soil erodibility indices, pore size distribution, soil moisture
release characteristics, profile water holding capacity, available
water capacity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, were
collected from 0, 10, 30, 60 and 100 soil depth at four different
representative areas on each site. Soil samples were then taken
for laboratory analysis of physical and hydrologic soil properties
using standardized laboratory procedures.
The bulk density for the cropland had an average value of
1.16 g -3 em as opposed to forest and grassland sites with average
va1ues af 1 .02 and 1 .1 g cm-3 respec t'lve1y. 0rganl.c matt.er con-ten t

indices showed significant differences between the three sites.
The forest site showed higher readily available water content
than the other two sites. The cropland site had the highest amount
of non readily available water than grassland and forest sites.
The three sites showed different patterns of soil moisture release

"uonbi:11295/27542";"Effects of land use change on soil qualities in Sasumua catchment";"";"Sustainability of natural resource base is dependent on good land management. Land use change
from forest to agricultural land can endanger sustainability of soil productivity if not well
managed. Effects of land use change from forest to annual crop cultivation and grazing on soil
qualities were investigated in Sasumua catchment with the aim of (a) determining the changes in
selected physical and chemical qualities (b) establishing how various soil quality indicators vary
with different land management practices and (c) developing the minimum data set for
determination of soil health. A survey of farms and forest was carried out by collecting soil and
water samples from randomly selected sites. Measurement of CEC, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and
Na, pH, EC, base saturation, total N, soil carbon and texture, bulk density and hydraulic
conductivity was done on soil samples while water samples were analyzed for quality. Effects of
land management practices were determined using structured questionnaire. The long term
effects of cultivation of land after land use change from forest was determined by comparing the
levels of selected soil qualities over a 30 years period. These results were then subjected to
factor analysis using principal component analysis to determine the appropriate indicators by
developing the minimum data set. The results shows significant change of soil pH and silt
content when land is converted from forest to grazing land and annual crops cultivation. In
grazing land ; CEC , exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+, base saturation and sac decreased by 8%,
42%, 52%, 32% and 8% respectively while Total N increased by 6 % . In annual crop cultivated
land; exchangeable Ca2+and Mg2+, base saturation and sac decreased by 31% ,40% ,32% and
8% respectively, while CEC, Total N, and bulk density increased by 14%, 23% and 10%
respectively. Land management practices such as intensive cultivation of horticultural crops,
overgrazing of pastureland and farming on steep areas were contributing to soil chemical and
physical degradation while addition of farmyard manure and agro forestry were contributing to
sustainability of soil organic carbon and bulk density. Tillage in cultivated fields influenced
increase in CEC. Water quality results indicated that land use management affected quality as it
flows from forest to areas with human settlements. It was found that there is a decline of soil
quality over the 30 year period. This soil quality decline from 1977 to 2007 is related to the
increase in the area population from 9 to 260 persons per square kilometer over the same period.

After lengthy efforts to control tsetse over many years, the valley is currently experiencing an increase in human population growth rate, and rapid changes in land-use and cover are taking place. Using time-series aerial photograph interpretation, social survey methods, and a review of human population trends over five decades, a three-fold expansion in cultivation in the settled areas over a 50-year period, with a consequent decrease in woody vegetation cover was identified. In the Ruma National Park, occupying a third of the valley floor, shrublands and thickets have expanded while open grasslands have decreased. The sudden increase of land under cultivation adjacent to prime agricultural land designated for wildlife conservation, exacerbated by bush encroachment and dwindling resources for tsetse control could provide a situation suitable for land-use conflicts. Sustainability of this unique rangeland is dependent on how judiciously the resources are shared among all stakeholders in the valley. This study suggests continued tsetse surveillance and agricultural intensification in the settled areas to minimise chances of conflicts in land-use.";"Muriuki, G W

"uonbi:11295/102855";"The Impact Land Sub-division and Fragmentaion on Rural Development: a Case Study of Vihiga County";"";"Vihiga is one of the most densely populated counties in Kenya with a current population density of 1,045 persons per square km. The high population has exerted enormous pressure on available land resource resulting in land fragmentation and uneconomic subdivision. However the seriousness of the problem has not been systematically analyzed and documented. This study determined the level, causes and analyzed impacts of land fragmentation and uneconomic sub-division on rural development, assessed the acceptability of alternative human settlement pattern and has proposed policy and planning interventions. Using simple random sampling method, 127 households from Lusengeli Sublocation in Sabatia District and 183 households from Esianda Sublocation in Vihiga District were interviewed to determine the level and causes of land fragmentation and un-economical land subdivision. In addition to secondary data, primary data were collected using household questionnaires, observation, check list, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The data was analyzed by use of descriptive statistics and presented in form of tables, charts, photographs and text. With Simons Index (SI), the study reveals presence of land fragmentation in the county. However, the level of fragmentation is higher in Lusengeli Sublocation (0.5) compared to Esianda Sublocation (0.8) with a total average of 0.65. There is also problem of small land size and uneconomical land sub-division with average household land size of 0.41 hectares. A large proportion of households (56.5%) lack title deeds of the land on which they reside. The cause of land fragmentation and uneconomic land subdivision is tradition of land inheritance, land purchase for purpose of farming, investment or bequeathing the heirs and need for space of settlement. Land fragmentation has had both socio-economic and environmental impacts on rural development. There is reported low household income, population out migration and negative environment impact in addition to land related conflicts that are linked to Land fragmentation and uneconomic sub-division in the county. Though dispersed settlement pattern is preferred, the challenge it poses to a highly populated area with scarce land resource is noted. However, the values of cluster settlement are acknowledged though there is need of attitude change to embrace this form of settlement. The study recommends the following: Adhering to land use planning both in rural and urban areas, starting a land bank program, enabling functional and dynamic land market by facilitating acquisition of land title deed, alternative form of inheritance to replace land inheritance, land consolidation at both household and neighborhood level, creation of more job opportunities and family planning to control population growth.";"Kihima, Mise V";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"development;rural development";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/102855";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102855/Kihima%2cMise%20V_The%20Impact%20Land%20Sub-division%20and%20Fragmentaion%20on%20Rural%20Development-a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Vihiga%20County.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102855/Kihima%2cMise%20V_The%20Impact%20Land%20Sub-division%20and%20Fragmentaion%20on%20Rural%20Development-a%20Case%20Study%20of%20Vihiga%20County.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"The Impact Land Sub-division and Fragmentaion on Rural Development";""

It was observed that patterns of land-use have principally changed from nomadic pastoralism to sedentary pastoralism, agropastoralism, and, in some cases, pure cultivation. These trends have adversely affected livestock production and the productive capacity of the Mara ecosystem. Diminishing grazing area occasioned by expanding cropping patterns has negatively impacted on vegetation resources and the biodiversity of the ecosystem. It has also increased the intensity of conflict over diminishing land resources. Because the production system is largely subsistence with a strong livestock base, it is further undermined by, among other factors, animal diseases, water scarcity, land individualisation, poor marketing infrastructure, and livestock/wildlife conflicts. Based on the findings of the present study, development approaches need to emphasise
integrated livestock and wildlife utilisation, land tenure reforms that embody livestock mobility as a key strategy of optimising the use of transient forage resources, disease control, and development of livestock marketing.";"Nyariki, D. M

This paper traces the land tenure systems that have existed in the Kenya’s secondary towns. In general, the paper examines the effects of land tenure forms on the provision of housing and the related infrastructure. The effects of existing land tenure identified include influence on housing development, influence on planned land development, cloudiness of titles, hoarding and speculation, insecurity, inflexibility and inequity.

"uonbi:11295/20395";"Development of integrated land information management system in Kenya";"";"Land is a key asset of any country. It is one of the factors of production which includes labour
and capital. It is critical for economic, social and political development of a country. There exists
a correlation between proper utilization of land and the economic advancement of a country and
its proper management can only be achieved if information on the said land is available. The
current globalization trend in the world, demand for efficient and effective land services requires
development of an integrated land information management system. Land information is both in
spatial and attribute form. The basics of an integrated land information management system are
the cadastral and land administration systems. These systems playa critical role in collection,
management and dissemination of information about land ownership, use and value. Therefore
an integrated land information management system should address the four key components
which includes; land tenure; land value; land use and land development.
In developing an information system the process involves following a formalized approach to
implement System Development Life Cycle. System Development Life Cycle is composed of
four distinct phases which include planning, analysis, design and implementation. Depending on
whether the emphasis is on business processes or the data that supports business there are various
methodologies or approaches. These models includes; Waterfall Model, Prototype Model,
Throwaway Prototyping Model, Spiral Model, Rapid Application Development Model, Serum
Model, Extreme Programming Model, Object Oriented Model, Dynamic Systems Development
Model, Capability Maturity Model, View model and Unified Process Model. A model that will
be used to develop an integrated land information management system is key in the management
of land. This will ensure the country offers effective and efficient services to its citizens and the
land information produced can be used by the country to make timely and efficient decisions.
In this research, we explored the above models and identified their weaknesses, strengths and
gaps. This was done visa a vis the characteristics of the Integrated Land Information
Management System. We adopted the Unified Process Model for developing the Integrated
Land Information Management System. The main characteristics of this model which includes;
Iterative and Incremental, Use Case Driven, Architecture Centric and Risk Focused were some
of the major points that made us adopt the methodology. Further in selecting the methodology
the following factors were considered: on whether the system has unclear user requirements; the
developer is familiar with the technology to be used; the methodology is complex, reliable; the
schedule of developing and implementing the system i.e., the system is on time, budget and
captures the user's needs.
To find out whether it was appropriate to develop the system and also to identify the user and
system requirements the research methodology used in this research was mainly survey. We
collected data from clients and staff in 10 districts where the land offices are located. The results
of the study showed that both the clients and staffs would like us to develop a system. This
system should be an integrated system and should integrate all the key Ministry services.
To find out whether the adopted model for developing the Integrated Land Information
Management System was appropriate, a prototype of the system was developed and
implemented. This prototype was for Buruburu Block 78 and 79 or Phase IV and V which is
based in Nairobi County. The prototype is a web-based system.
Finally, we identified the various challenges of developing the Integrated Land Information
Management System which includes: Political goodwill, Commitment of Heads of departments,
Establishing a project management team, Change management, Voluminous land records data, Establishing a uniform modem Geodetic Control Network framework and resurveying all the parcels to ensure accuracy and update information, Legal and Institution changes which may affect the handling of data and information, Security of land information both physically and logically, Rapidly changing technology and High cost of developing the system.
The outcome of our research is a prototype that can be implemented in the whole country by the Ministry of Lands.";"Mwangi, Gideon W";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2011-12-31";"en";"development";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/20395";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/20395/Mwangi_Development%20of%20integrated%20land%20information%20management%20system%20in%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/20395/Mwangi_Development%20of%20integrated%20land%20information%20management%20system%20in%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land;Information Management System";""

Ethno¬ecological studies on termite dynamics are central to formulation of sustainable termite management strategies in such ecosystems. This study was thus conducted to investigate farmers' traditional ecological knowledge of the termite problem with the intent to build more coherent principles required in the development of appropriate termite management strategies. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted to capture information on farmers' ethno-ecological knowledge of the factors enhancing termite damage on vegetation, temporal and spatial variability of damage and diversity of termite species in the Nakasongola ecosystem. Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a significant difference (X2=451.5, P>O.0001) among farmers' ranking of factors responsible for the destructive behavior of termites on rangeland vegetation. Overgrazing and deforestation ware ranked significantly higher (X2=156, P>O.0001) than other factors. Eight species were identified and the species belonged to one family (Termitidae) and two sub-families (Macrotermitinae and Termitinae). The study provided basic information about farmers' knowledge of the biology and ecology that could aid the development of sustainable and socially acceptable termite control strategies.";"Mugerwa, swidiq

In particular, it is made more urgent by the rapidly increasing levels of urbanisation that has resulted into acute shortage of residential land for low-income households. Using the neighbourhood of Bahati Estate in Nairobi as a case study, this paper analyses the land utilisation in the inner city residential areas in Nairobi that were built before 1963. The analysis reveals that land in these neighbourhoods is currently under-utilised. This calls for a realistic strategy of intensifying the use of existing land. It is, therefore, recommended that a policy framework should be worked out within which the land rationalisation strategy would be operationalised";"Shihembetsa, Laban U.

woody vegetation degradation associated with intensive land use activities has become a national
concern. It was undertaken with an overall objective of documenting the impacts of land use and
topography on the spatial distribution of two gum and incense producing tree species, Boswellia
papyrifera (Del.) Hochst and Commiphora africana (A. Rich.) Engl.. Five land use units, each with two
slope categories ( 25% and > 25%) were subjected to a 5x2 factorial arrangement and a total of 50
sample points were employed to measure density, crown cover, and age ratio of trees. Analysis of
vegetation attributes revealed that, except for density of C. africana, all the vegetation attributes did
show lower status in the heavily populated land use units than the control site reflecting the differential
impact of intensive land use pressure against protection. In the heavily populated land use unit (Luu-
3) for example, density, cover and age ratio of B. papyrifera trees were as low as 8.3 trees/ha, 7.7% and
0.21 respectively. In contrast to this, i.e. in the site of low population pressure (the control) the same
attributes appeared to be measured as 77 trees/ha, 7.7% and 0.51 respectively. However, attached to
the proximity ecological position, density and crown cover of B. papyrifera showed no significant
difference (P. > 0.05) between Luu-1 and Luu-2. Density of C. africana, most likely due to its affinity to
a specific microhabitat, it did not differ among all land use units (P > 0.05). Between the slope aspects
of the area, B. papyrifera and C. africana were found to dominate the steep (>25%) and gentle ( 25%)
slopes respectively. Regarding density of B. papyrifera, while it was 196 trees/ha in the steep slope,
146 trees/ha were documented from the lower slope aspect. Inversely related to this, C. africana had 68
and 102 trees/ha on >25% and 25% slopes respectively. Age ratio analysis of B. papyrifera trees,
however, did not show significant difference (P > 0.05) between these two slope categories. In the
study area therefore, land use and slope were identified as determinant factors to the spatial distribution
of woody vegetation and policy frameworks to account these factors are suggested to be substantial
in the management of such resources.";"Turi, Chane G

The study evaluated supplementation of weaner Galla goats with increasing amounts of Prosopis juliflora seedpods that is widely distributed in arid and semi arid areas of Kenya. This species is drought tolerant and with high productivity of seed pods whole year round. The overall aim of this study was therefore, to assess the feasibility of incorporating P. juliflora seedpods into a typical dry land livestock production system. The study further sought to find out the optimum supplementation level for improved performance. The experiment involved 20 weaner Galla goats of similar age (6 months) and weights (11-14 kg) which were randomly assigned to four treatments of 5 weaners each. The treatments were No P. juliflora (PJP0), 100 g/goat/day P. juliflora (PJP100), 200 g/goat/day P. juliflora (PJP200), 400 g/goat/day P. juliflora (PJP400). Supplementation involved providing the goats with their respective diets in the morning before mixed species range grass hay was offered as basal diet. The animals were weighed on weekly basis and weight gains calculated as difference in previous week’s weight and current week’s weight. The experiment lasted for 70 days. Overall, all the treatment groups exhibited higher average weekly weight gains than the control group throughout the experimental period. However, for the first 3 weeks, this was not statistically significant (p<0.05). From the 5th week up to the 10th week, there was significant difference (p<0.05) in the growth rates for the treatments except for the control group. Overall, treatment PJP200 exhibited highest total weight gain (3.960c) followed by PJP400 (2.700 kg). Group PJP0 had the lowest weight gain by the end of the experiment. The supplemented groups showed good weight gains, body condition and retained nitrogen levels compared to the un-supplemented groups";"Kipchirchir, Koech, O

can mainly be attributed to increased livestock populations and the response of the increased human
population to both local and exogenous opportunities and constraints. This study was carried out in
Kibwezi district of Kenya mainly inhabited by agro-pastoralists. The main objective of this study was to
establish how different land use types influence soil properties in tropical semi-arid rangelands.
Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples from three land use types namely cultivated land (CL), grazing
land (GL) and fallow land (FL) at a depth of 15-30cm were collected and analyzed using standard
laboratories for soil nutrients and soil physical properties. Results show open grazing lands (CEC 19.59
meq/100g) to be more fertile than cultivated (13.88 meq/100g) and fallow (6.40 meq/100g) lands. This
was attributed to the continuous dropping of faecal material by grazing livestock. Higher bulk density in
grazing land (1.36 g/cm3) compared to cultivated and fallow lands with 1.29 g/cm3 and 1.33 g/cm3 was
attributed to the hoof action of livestock. These results suggest that different land use types in the
semi-arid rangelands contribute immensely to soil properties.";"Mganga, Kevin Z.

Africa has become the one continent in the world where human life is hardly worth living because of the man-made problems of inequality and impoverishment.
This thesis examines the effect of land consolidation on gender inequality and feminized poverty in a particular community in Kenya. This depends on historical documentation, comparative statistical evidence and interviews that the author conducted in the Siaya District of Kenya as well as in Nairobi. The thesis argues that land consolidation turned out to be a policy of dispossession and impoverishment imposed and sustained by a particular colonial authority on the people of Siaya. It does not accept suggestions that land consolidation was a positive development policy. Initially it started as a punitive measure that was imposed by colonial force in a state of emergency. The Luo people were not recognised as having their own traditional way of land ownership and use, a right and a heritage that had served them for centuries. An honest and ethical approach to life that had been inculcated in the culture and widely reflected due to lack of policy informed development. The Luo as a society sacrificed and lost all their dignity, and their social, human, physical and economic resources to colonial and post colonial Kenya. Siaya eventually became the most socially underdeveloped and therefore the poorest district in Kenya.
This thesis is presented at a time when, paradoxically, the international community has resolved to eradicate poverty from the face of the earth. Different international agencies accept that this is possible. Certainly it will depend on a strong will. There are many people in the world who are ready to help others empower themselves, but not discriminate against them or dominate them. These are the people who will confront the problem discussed in this thesis. Overall, this thesis contributes to an understanding of the reasons why poverty has not been eradicated in Siaya and may even have increased. Having^vitnessed the failure of development policy, humanity will be defeated and international citizenship will remain a dream in the next century unless strategies to eradicate poverty and gender inequality become more successful.";"Odhiambo, Lewis Omwanda";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2006-12-31";"en";"land policies;women";"Land & Gender";"202";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/40500";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/40500/Odhiambo_Land%20Policy%20And%20Gender%20In%20Sub-Saharan%20Africa%20The%20Effect%20Of%20Land%20Consolidation%20On%20The%20Differential%20Status%20Of%20Women%20And%20Men%20In%20The%20Siaya%20District%20Of%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/40500/Odhiambo_Land%20Policy%20And%20Gender%20In%20Sub-Saharan%20Africa%20The%20Effect%20Of%20Land%20Consolidation%20On%20The%20Differential%20Status%20Of%20Women%20And%20Men%20In%20The%20Siaya%20District%20Of%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land policies;Sub-Saharan Africa";""

"uonbi:11295/20254";"Effects of land tenure status on land productivity and sustainable livelihood in the traditional pastoral areas of Kenya: a case of Narok District.";"";"This Thesis analyzed the effects of land tenure status on land productivity and sustainable
livelihoods in the traditional pastoral areas in Narok District, and recommended policy
guidelines to the government and other stakeholders. Land tenure status is a critical concern
facing traditional pastoral areas in Kenya, especially in Narok District. It affects production
activities and influences livelihoods. Rapid population growth, deferring individual
preferences amongst the communities, the existing legal framework and inappropriate
technologies within the fragile ecosystem, pose a great challenge to sustainable livelihoods in
these areas.
The main objective of the study was to specifically analyze the effects of land tenure status
on land productivity, its influence on the intensity of land degradation and its effects on
sustainable management of land resource in terms of investment decisions on land
improvement. A survey was conducted in Narok District between October and December
2004. One hundred fifty (150) household heads were interviewed in thirty-eight (38) villages:
within five (5) Locations spread over two (2) Divisions in the medium and marginal areas in
the District. The selection of the survey villages was accomplished through a stratified
random sampling. The concept of group ranches was used as basis for the study and adopted
three models; Cobb-Douglas production function for land productivity, Tobit model for
intensity of land degradation and Multinomial Logit model for investment decisions on land
improvement. The models were estimated and the parameter estimates were interpreted.
The major findings of the study revealed that the effects of land tenure change from the
group ranch system decreased household size, increased formal education levels. decreased
reliance on livestock keeping as the sole source of livelihood. increased infrastructural and
residential status development from traditional hut to modem buildings, decreased factor
inputs productivity, increase access to credit. decrease household vulnerability to drought,
increased the number of alternative livelihood activities, increased investment decisions on
land improvement, increased technological transformation from simple tools to modem
machinery and increased intensity and accelerate land degradation. Therefore. the study
concluded that land tenure status affects land productivity and influenced livelihood
activities, and moreover, subdivision of the group ranches into individually owned parcels in
The study recommend the government to review the existing legal framework and formulate
ASALs policy with clear guidelines on land subdivision which is based on resource potential
that recognizes indigenous tenure systems and entrench gender concerns in land distribution.
The government and other stakeholders should invest in formal education efforts,
environmental conservation, and value adding processes backed up with appropriate
technology in line with alternative livelihood strategies such as dairy goats, bee keeping,
poultry and tourism related micro enterprises among others. The government through.
microfinance agencies should provide infrastructural development loans to establish
individual water sources and fodder development for each privately owned parcel. The
development plan should focus on community capacity building and strengthening household
vulnerability initiatives through effective institutional drought management measures. The
plan should seek to provide market outlet both locally and internationally that takes in large
number of livestock especially times of stress such as drought. These recommendations are
geared to guarantee sustainable livelihoods for inhabitants of the area";"Kateiya Edward L";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2006-12-31";"en";"area;land tenure";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/20254";"";"";"";"";"";"Land tenure;Land productivity;Sustainable Livelihood;Traditional Pastoral areas;Narok District;Kenya";""

"uonbi:11295/12130";"Land use change and its effects on soil and vegetation degradation in Kibwezi District.";"";"Land degradation is caused by removal of vegetation cover and subsequent fertility loss. Frequent
assessment of land use changes and their effects on soil and vegetation in ranches is critical to their
conservation. This study, carried out in four selected ranches in Kibwezi District is important because
previous studies in the area have mainly dwelt on soil erosion and no research has been done on
effects of land use changes on soil quality in terms of organic carbon, total nitrogen and vegetation
cover. The objectives of the study were to determine plant species density and diversity; assess soil
quality in terms of total nitrogen content and organic carbon; and determine the relationship between
abundance of plant species and soil characteristics to ascertain levels of soil and vegetation
degradation. This study was intended to shed light on the impacts of land use changes on the
productivity of rangelands in relation to soil quality and vegetation cover.
Transects measuring 200m traversing cultivated farms and grazing areas were established within the
study sites namely Kiu, Ngaamba, Ulu/Aimi and Konza South ranches. Data was collected in three
seasons. Phase one and three during the wet seasons and phase two in the dry season. Trees and
herbaceous plants species were sampled using the Point Centered Quarter method (PCQ) and 1m2
quadrat respectively. Where shrubs were encountered a 5m xl Om quadrat was used. Soil samples were
collected from a monoIith measuring 10cm x 10cm x 30cm at the centre of each 1m2 quadrat.
Total nitrogen was determined using the Wet Digestion method, Organic carbon using Walkley-Black
method and soil texture by Bouyoucos or hydrometer method. Soil moisture was determined using
Anderson and Ingram method while for soil pH 50ml of deionised water was added to 20 ± O.Ig soil
measured on 2.5: 1water to soil suspension.
A total of five species belonging to four families were recorded during the study. Acacia tortilis had
the highest density across seasons (291.4 trees per hectare) and Lannea schwanfurthii (8.25 trees per
hectare) the least. Diversity indices of trees revealed a significant difference in species richness among
the ranches (F [3, 16] = 5.066, P <0.05) with Konza ranch recording the highest diversity index.
ANOV A test revealed a significant difference in the mean abundance of tree stumps among the
ranches (F [3, 6] = 159.458, P <0.05) where Ulu/ Aimi ranch contributed the highest number of tree
stumps in the study area while Ngaamba had the least. ANOV A test revealed a significant difference
in the mean abundance of shrubs species among the ranches (F [3, 126] = 0.993, P <O.OS) with Ulu ranch
recording the least abundance. There was also a significant difference in the mean abundance of grass
species among the ranches (F [3, 169] = 21.S04, P <O.OS).
Results of ANOY A test revealed significant differences in the mean abundance of forbs species
among the ranches (F [3,214] = S.792, P <O.OS). ANOYA test results for soil analysis revealed no
significant differences between the ranches in terms of both total nitrogen (F [3,5] =3.262, p>O.OS) and
organic carbon (F [3,5] =1.763, p>O.OS) in the soil. The broad ratings of carbon and nitrogen confirmed
that the four ranches had very low levels of both organic carbon and total nitrogen.
Both grass and forbs species had no significant correlations with pH (r = 0.24, p>O.OS and 0.2, p>O.OS
respectively), while shrubs showed significant correlation (r = -0.4, p<O.OS). Shrubs (r= 0.61, p>O.OS;
0.42, p>O.OS and 0.06, p>O.OS respectively) and forbs (r = -0.02, p>O.OS; -0.18, p>O.OS and -0.17,
p>O.OS respectively) had no significant correlation with organic carbon, total nitrogen and moisture
respectively while grass had a significant correlation with moisture (-0.S3, p<O.OS) but no significant
correlation with organic carbon (r= -0.3S, p>O.OS) and total nitrogen (-0.2S, p>O.OS).
The results of the study showed that there was a decline in plant species diversity, this probably being
as a result of increased human activities in the ranches. It is therefore important to sensitize farmers on

However, desertification characterized by vegetation degradation and soil erosion is a major threat to the sustainability of land-based production systems. Native rangeland forage species Cenchrus ciliaris L. (Buffel grass/African foxtail grass), Eragrostis superba Peyr. (Maasai love grass) and Enteropogon macrostachyus (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) Monro ex Benth. (Bush rye grass) have been used to combat desertification. The objectives of the study were to identify the best-suited native grass species to combat desertification in a semi-arid environment in Kenya and to identify the preferred grass species among the agropastoralists in the area. Percentage basal cover, plant densities and frequencies of the three grasses in pure stands and mixtures were estimated. Grass species preferences were through household survey and focus group discussion. Results showed a significant difference (P < 0·05) in plant densities and cover estimates: E. macrostachyus was ranked first; C. ciliaris and E. superba were ranked second and third respectively. The agropastoral farmers, however, preferred E. superba followed by C. ciliaris and E. macrostachyus, a reverse trend. These results suggest that the choice of grass species to combat desertification is influenced more by its contribution as a source of forage for livestock than its contribution for rehabilitation purposes.";"Mganga, K Z

Kenyan Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) have been facing extensive land use/ cover changes in the last three decades prompting a review on the impacts it has on soil quality and consequently on land degradation. This study was carried out in 2016 in Olesharo Catchment, Narok County, one of the prominent ASALs of Kenya. The main objective of the study was to study how the different lands use types within the catchment affects SOC and Total Nitrogen (TN) stocks in the catchment. Using LandSat imageries, four land use types were identified: Shrubland (SH), Agricultural Land (AG), Grasslands (GR) and BareLands (BL). Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from 30 x 30m plots randomly distributed for each of the Land use type (LUT) at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths for the analysis of SOC/ and TN stocks. The study showed that the means of SOC in land use types were significantly different (P<0.05). Shrublands registered the highest mean total of 31.26 Mg C ha-1 which was significantly higher than GR (13.54 Mg C ha-1) and BL (12.85 Mg C ha-1). In terms of TN mean values, SH was the highest (4.22 Mg N ha-1) while BL was the lowest (1.6 Mg N ha-1). Similarly, the mean SOC and TN stocks in the surface layers (21.38 Mg N ha-1) were significantly higher than the sub-surface (18.74 Mg N ha-1) layers indicative of the stocks decreased as depth increased. The results suggest that land use types have influence on soil properties and their management can contribute to sustainable land management to mitigate negative effects of climate change.";"Sainepo, Bernice

food requirement and is referred to as a net importer of food.
However, technologies that can improve food production in the area
exist and continue being developed. These technologies include:
deep tillage, timely planting, use of green manure, animal manure •
and fertilizer application.
Social capital refers to the various social relationships and networks
and the resources that become available thereof. Adoption has to do
with application of at least one or all of the following land and water
technologies: deep tillage, early planting, line planting, green manure,
animal manure and fertilizer rates.
The study set out to investigate the effect of social capital on adoption
of land and water technologies by smallholder farmers in Kaloleni
division of Kilifi District. The study took a representative sample of
120 smallholder farmers in three locations namely Ruruma, Rabai
and Kaloleni. The objective of this study was to examine the role of social capital in
smallholder farmers' access to the factors that facilitate adoption
focussing on land and water technologies. The data for the study was
collected using structured interviews, direct observation and in-depth
interviews. The study findings show that social capital plays an important role in
the process of acquiring ingredients necessary for successful
adoption in terms of access to information, resource mobilisation,
technology awareness and application. There was significant
relationship between the various aspects for example farmers are
willing to contribute resources if they trust that they will be used for
the intended purpose. The results. further show that other factors play
important role in adoption for example access to resource which are
necessary to purchase inputs necessary for successful adoption.
The study concluded that social plays an important role in technology
adoption, especially in making it possible to reach a large number of
farmers using limited resources. This is made possible by farmers'
willingness to share information with fellow group members, friends
and neighbours thus enabling spread of information. However social
capital on its own does not enable technology adoption. It acts as a
catalyst for accessing the ingredients necessary for successful
adoption. It recommended that there is need to develop a subsidy or
credit system that enable farmers purchase the inputs and
implements necessary for successful adoption. Technologies
developed and packaging should take into consideration the varied
economic levels of farmers in order to ensure successful uptake and
adoption.";"Wachira, Stephanie W";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2007-08-31";"en";"farmers";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/17273";"";"";"";"";"";"Social capital;Land & water technologies;Kenya";""

resources undocumented. Environmental conflicts mostly depend over human needs and issues
such as distribution, allocation and natural resources management. History documents show how
resource-based conflicts had contributed to highly destructive wars at Karamoja and Kagera
regions of Uganda, Darfur in Sudan, in Rwanda genocide and even in the Niger Delta. Mau
Forest Complex is Kenya’s important water tower. Important rivers that deplete in to Lake
Victoria, such as Rive Nile the longest one in the world originate there. Yet this important
resource has come under enormous human pressure, that lead to degradation and which is
pregnant with the antecedents of conflict. In early 1993 and 1994, for example, plantations and
forest areas were widely destroyed after a sequence of presidential decrees that allowed evicted
settlement after the elimination of the ‘shamba’ system in 1987. On diverse date’s between1990s
and 2000, a component of the Mau Forest Complex was excised to settle forest-dwelling
communities with aim of conserving the remains of the forests. The aerial recommendation over
Mau Complex destruction done in support of United Nations Environmental Program, Ministry
of Environment and Mineral Resources on 7th May 2008 documented the amazing level of
obliteration and degradation at Mau ecosystem. Thus, environmental conflict and land
degradation at Mau Complex present a clear and present threat, to Kenya’s domestic political
stability and achievements of its Vision of 2030 goals, even significant regional and global
threats as well. Over 80% of land area in Kenya consists of arid and semi-arid lands with low
population densities that depend on livestock to cater for their livelihood. 12% of Kenya’s land
cover has suited climate with closed canopy forest, protected either under Forest Reserves under
management of Kenya Forest Service or National Parks under management of Kenya Wildlife
Service or trust land forests under management of Local Authorities. The study point out the
general intention of the causes and manifestations of land degradation and environmental conflict
at Mau Complex, how they affect the mandate and the work of the Kenya Forest Service. The
study explored how conflicts may be prevented or resolved peacefully. Primary and secondary
data were both used in the study. It used purposive and snowball selective sampling and
interview respondents in the known categories in both main research sites. The quantitative and
qualitative collected data has been presented according to the specific objectives of the study in
the research. Weak institutional policies and poor enforcement of forest laws were noted as
major drivers of Kenya’s forest cover change.";"Mwaniki, Samuel K";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-12-31";"en";"environment;land degradation";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/100228";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100228/Mwaniki_The%20Role%20of%20the%20Kenya%20Forest%20Service%20in%20the%20Management%20of%20Land%20Degradation%20and%20Environmental%20Conflict%20in%20the%20Mau%20Forest%20Complex.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100228/Mwaniki_The%20Role%20of%20the%20Kenya%20Forest%20Service%20in%20the%20Management%20of%20Land%20Degradation%20and%20Environmental%20Conflict%20in%20the%20Mau%20Forest%20Complex.pdf.jpg?sequence=6&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Land Degradation and Environmental Conflict";""

"uonbi:11295/93093";"Effects of holistic grazing management on soil physico-chemical properties and herbaceous vegetation production in  Naibunga Conservancy, Laikipia County, Kenya";"";"This study evaluated the effects of holistic grazing management (HGM) on biomass production and soil properties under holistic and non-holistic grazing sites. The study was conducted in two Group Ranches namely, Koija and Il Motiok in Naibunga Conservancy, Laikipia County, Kenya. Vegetation attributes and soil parameters were determined in four plots randomly sited and established within the Il Motiok Ranch, which is under HGM, and in the same number of plots sited and established in Koija Ranch which is under free-range grazing system. Herbaceous vegetation and soil parameters were determined along two transects placed diagonally across each plot. Along each transect, soil samples were collected at two depths 0-10cm and 10-20cm using a standard soil auger. The results of the analyses show that herbaceous standing biomass and yield was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in holistic than non-holistic grazing sites. Mean organic carbon and moisture content, pH, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity (CEC), potassium, phosphorus, aggregate stability, hydraulic conductivity, and water content were significantly higher (P < 0.005) under holistic grazing than non-holistic grazing sites. Conversely, soil bulk density and penetration resistance were greater under holistic grazing regimes. This study has demonstrated that holistic grazing management has the potential to significantly improve the soil properties and range productivity. These results are attributed to the beneficial effects of grazing that includes hoof action on soil and fertilization from animal dung and manure that occur when grazing animals are congregated together to assert maximum impact on soil and pasture for a short duration followed by adequate rest durations to allow post-grazing pasture recovery. However, monitoring of the study sites would be helpful in determining the long-term effects of holistic grazing management in pastoral rangelands.

"uonbi:11295/26114";"Influence of soil, climate and land use on soil water balance in the Upper Ewaso Ng'iro Basin in Kenya";"";"The influence of soil, climate, and land use on soil water balance was investigated in 3
agroclimatic zones within the Upper Ewaso Ng'iro Basin. Water balance was quantified
for various land uses and management systems in each zone. These were natural forest (NF),
grazing land (GL) and potato cropland (PC) on a mollic Andosol at Karuri; conventional
tillage (CT), mulch tillage (MT), overgrazing (OG) and controlled grazing (CG) on a ferric
Luvisol at Kalalu; and perennial grass (PO), enclosed perennial grass (PE), bare ground
(BO), enclosed bare ground (BE) and runon (bare ground with a bush and grass at the lower
end (RO) sites on a chromic Lixisol at Mukogodo. Soil moisture, runoff and soil cover for
each system; and rainfall and evaporation at each site, were monitored for four rainy
seasons (September 1993-August 1995). Selected soil physical properties for each system
were also measured.
The climatic water balance was negative at all sites as the ratio of mean annual rainfall to
mean annual potential evaporation was 0.65, 0.47 and 0.16 for Karuri, Kalalu and
Mukogodo, respectively. The annual rainfall means during the monitoring period were
similar to available long term records. Total mean runoff as percentage of rainfall in the
four seasons at Karuri was 6.6% in PC and 1.6% in GL; at Kalalu it was 6.6, 0.01, 30.0
and 4.0% in CT, MT, OG and CG, respectively; and at Mukogodo it was 25.1, 35.2, 9.9,
51.1 and 47.6% in RO, PO, PE, BO and BE, respectively. Runoff from cropland at Karuri
and Kalalu during big storms (>20 mm day"") was up to 40% of rainfall, and for similar
events up to 80% from overgrazed sites at Kalalu and Mukogodo. Bush canopy basal
cover (RO) intercepted and infiltrated up to 50% of runoff flowing from bare ground.
Both BO and BE at Mukogodo had similar cover. However, cover in PE increased to
about 3 times that in PO. Runoff decreased with increase of cover in all sites and
treatments. Calculated minimum (threshold) amount of rainfall required to generate
runoff increased with soil cover and ranged from 11-14 mm day"" in cropland and from 6-
12 mm day"" in grazing land. Runoff significantly correlated with amount of rainfall in
cropland only at Karuri and for cover >30% (r2 = 0.71), but at all sites in grazing land (r2
= 0.65 at Karuri, 0.76-0.94 at Kalalu, and 0.51-0.62 at Mukogodo). Runoff also
significantly correlated with rainfall erosivity at all sites; that in grazing land (r2 = 0.88 at
Karuri, 0.56-0.98 at Kalalu, and 0.49-0.68 at Mukogodo) was stronger than in cropland
(r2 = 0.49-0.79 at Karuri and 0.77 at Kalalu).
Available soil water stored at Karuri ranged from 140, 130 and 120 mm in the driest
period to 230, 205 and 185 mm in the wettest period of the year for NF, GL and PC,
respectively, in 160 em soil depth. On annual average, NF (192 mm) had significantly
higher available water than GL (169 mm) and PC (153 mm). Available water stored in
Kalalu cropland was 88 and 37 mm in the driest period, and 222 and 176 mm in the
wettest period of the year for MT and CT, respectively in 160 em soil depth. Higher
moisture was recorded in MT than CT in both times. In grazing land, CG stored 46%
more water (147 mm) than OG (101 mm) in the wettest period, but there was no available
water in the driest period in both CG and OG. Moisture recharge in the wet seasons was
limited to only 90 em in OG, but like in cropland, it percolated beyond 120 ern in CG.
None of the treatments at Mukogodo had any available water in the dry seasons. Even in
the wettest period, only 19, 13, 20, 9 and 7 mm of water was available within a depth of
80 em in RO, PO, PE, BO and BE, respectively. That in RO and PE were significantly
higher (P<0.05) than the rest. Moisture percolated to only about 50 em under good cover
and to about 30 cm on bare ground even in the wettest period at Mukogodo.
Water use was higher in PC (4-18%) and GL (7-20%) than NF in the 4 growing seasons,
indicating that the forest extracted less water than potato and grass from within the 160
em soil depth. At Kalalu, MT used more (18-42%) water than CT during the long rains.
However, in the short rains, some moisture was conserved and carried over, resulting in
lower (10-26%) water use in MT compared to CT. Water use was higher (21-24%) in CG
compared to OG in all seasons. At Mukogodo water use was 13-20% and 32-55% lower
in PO and BO, respectively, than RO in the 4 growing seasons. In all seasons PE used
significantly (P<0.05) more water than PO (23-61%) and BO (57-95%). Higher (8-33%)
water use by PE than RO was attributed to higher evapotranspiration by grass in the open

production. The district relies heavily on farming for food and income generating activities for the households.
However, poverty level has been on the increase due to poor crop production and limited diversity in sources of
income. Analysis of field survey carried in the district shows high variability of soil nutrients (Nitrogen,
Phosphorous, and potassium), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and soil pH due to various land use systems
which have been in use for a long time. These land use systems have contributed to land degradation and
increased sediment fluxes from farm lands. Subsequently, food production has declined by 50%due to soil fertility
decline leading to increased household poverty levels. This is based on a survey study carried in the district
between the year 2005 and 2008. The district has also experienced increased sediment influxes problem in water
supply systems. These have affected immensely water sources in the district namely, earth dams, water pans,
traditional river wells among others. Continued sedimentation of these water sources has compromised the
quality and quantity of water supply in the district and therefore, changing the socio-economic characteristics of
many households. Increased sediment load is attributed to poor methods of farming and grazing such as lack of
contours, cut off drains, terraces and overgrazing. This paper examines soil erosion incidences, intensity of land";"Wambua, BN

More particularly, the study examines the place of aliens in Kenya with respect to property rights, notably rights to land. The Kenyan Constitution expressly deals with the question of discriminatory laws. Section 82(4)(a) allows the making of laws that discriminate between citizens and noncitizens. This gives validity to the various statutory provisions that restrict the acquisition of property by aliens. The general principle by which acquisition of landed property by aliens is restricted, takes concrete form under the Land Control Act, which relates to agricultural land. According to this Act, the acquisition of agricultural land by aliens is a privilege. However, by succession, testate or intestate, an alien can acquire landed property (even agricultural land) under the regime of property law.";"Bhalla, RS

Roadside transects conducted in 1976 and 1988 were compared with surveys done from 2003–2005 in and around Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Staggering declines in abundance were found for seven of eight scavenging raptors surveyed. No Egyptian vultures were seen during recent transects. We compared trends between the ungulate migration and non-migration season among three land use types (reserve, buffer, and grazed) and among the species surveyed to establish the causes of declines in scavenging raptors. Large declines during the ungulate migratory period suggest that most scavenging raptor species are declining well beyond the area of study. For all species, except Hooded vultures, substantial declines outside of the reserve indicate an important role of land use change in causing observed declines. In addition, significant declines of populations of Gyps species in the reserve itself, especially during the migration season, provide evidence that human activities occurring in other parts of the species’ range such as poisoning of carcasses may be causing their decline. Declines found in this study suggest that at a minimum African white-backed, Rüppell’s, and Hooded vultures should be relisted as Vulnerable. Management actions that limit land use change around the reserve combined with a countrywide ban on carbamate pesticides will be important for conserving keystone members of the scavenging guild. Future research should further examine possible causes of these declines and quantify the effect of reduced scavenging raptor abundance on scavenging efficiency.";"Thomsett, Simon

Ownership and Acquisition
Until 1967 the land belonged to a dairy farmer. His workers
had set up a co~operative with the intention of buying off
the farm from him. They formed a compa~y called Githurai
Thinganga. The land they bought consisted of three plots,
plot no. 5964/2 along the Kamiti road, plot no. 3543 which is
divided in two parts by the Thika road and plot no. 8867
which is on the Kiambu side of the settlement.
Sub-division
At the time of sub-division, the company allocated land in
three categories.
- residential plots which measured 50'x50' on the Nairobi side
and 100' x 100' on the Kiambu side. Each shareholder in
the company received two of each type of plot for every I
share he owned.
- plots for farming which measured 300' x 300' and were situated
in a tract of land along the river. Each shareholder received
one plot.
public utility space: 10 acres of land were given to the
Nairobi City Commission for use in providing public services.
8 Acres were set aside for a primary school which has already
been built. The remaining 2 acres were initially reserved
for a public health dispensary. However, instead the NCC
built a market which has Slnce remained unoccupied. This is
because the NCC has also permitted trading from within the
houses and this, coupled with heavy competition from the
hawkers, has discouraged traders from renting stalls in the

The study analyzed changes in natural resources in Kathakakai settlement scheme, Machakos County using participatory resource mapping, with the aim to discuss possible effects. The area, which used to be a ranching enterprise for nearly a hundred years, was sub divided in 1995 into individual farm holdings with average farm size of 2.5 hectares per household. Individual farmers cleared the land for agricultural activities and other land developments. The results show that natural resources have decreased since the ranch became a settlement scheme in 1995. Farmers indicated that the natural forests had decreased and were replaced by exotic trees. Vast land was cleared for cultivation, rivers, and dams had dried-up while soil erosion had increased. Majority of farmers (98%) said they had observed a general change in the climate of the area. They cited declining crop production (29%), increased drought (15%), and increased temperatures (10%) as some of the major pointers to climate change. However, farmers adopted various adapting and coping strategies. Drought tolerant crops (25%), early maturing crops (17%), and water harvesting (14%) were some of the strategies adopted by farmers in response to emerging changes.

"uonbi:11295/106671";"Evaluation of Grass Ecotypes for Potential Use in Reseeding of Pastoral Fields in the Arid and Semi-arid Lands of Kenya";"";"Cenchrus ciliaris L. (African foxtail grass) and Eragrostis superba Peyr. (Maasai lovegrass) grass
species that are native to the rangelands have been promoted for rehabilitation of degraded areas
and improve forage production. A major challenge to successful reseeding of the rangelands has
been lack of certified seeds of these species in the formal seed systems except through collections
from the wild. The main objective of the study was to contribute to improved livestock production
in the ASALs through characterization, evaluation and identification of higher yielding ecotypes
of C. ciliaris and E. superba that can be submitted for certification process.
Germplasm was collected from the wild in four agro-ecological zones (AEZ), represented by
Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Makueni and Kajiado Counties for AEZ III, IV, V and VI, respectively. Seeds
of eleven ecotypes for C. ciliaris and nine for E. superba were processed and planted in five rows
of four metres long in randomized complete block design with three replicates at KALRO Kiboko
Research Centre. Data were collected for stem, leaf and flowering traits while plant samples were
analysed for crude protein, crude fibre, ash, percent dry matter, and in-vitro digestibility of dry
matter. The levels of correlation and relatedness among the ecotypes was determined. Two clusters
of robust and small sized types were formed using plant height, stem thickness, leaf length and
leaf width. The small sized ecotypes were clustered as early flowering while the robust types were
late flowering indicating presence of early and late maturing ecotypes among the C. ciliaris
collection. MGD1 ecotype was found to be different from the rest due to clustering as a robust and
early flowering type. The recorded correlation between stem and leaf traits and nutritive
components, CP and INVDMD, in C. ciliaris ecotypes could be used to select for higher yielding
plants for the target nutritive values within the ecotypes. Clustering patterns for E. superba

ecotypes remained the same using either 16 different morphological traits, selected robustness
traits, namely, plant height, stem thickness, leaf length and leaf width, or seed yield traits. KBK1
and KBK2 ecotypes of E. superba remained clustered together in one group as robust types against
the rest of the seven ecotypes. Effect of the environment of collection including climate and
grazingland management may have influenced the plant size and maturity time among the C.
ciliaris ecotypes. The identified different clusters of C. ciliaris ecotypes allows for selection along
maturity time such as within the early flowering types, late flowering types and MGD1 as an early
maturing and robust type.
Significant genetic differences (<0.01) was recorded among ecotypes of C. ciliaris where Kajiado
population recorded the highest diversity indices while Kilifi and Narok collections were the most
distant populations. High genetic differentiation between populations of E. superba was recorded
with Fst=0.237, Gst= 0.534, mean Shannon diversity index (I=0.357) and Nei’s genetic diversity
index (h=0.223) among populations. There was possible exchange of genetic materials between
ecotypes of E. superba conserved in common gardens.
Evaluation of biomass yield among C. ciliaris ecotypes was done in three sites Kiboko, Buchuma
and Mtwapa KALRO Centres. Plots were established in three replicates of five rows each
measuring four metres long. Dry matter yield data was collected for two seasons and analysed
using AMMI stability value (ASV) and Yield stability index (YSI). Mean dry matter yield (DM)
of the C. ciliaris ecotypes across three sites ranged from 3986 to 11,792 kgha-1 where the small
sized types had the lowest yield. KBK3 ecotype was ranked the most stable across sites with ASV
and the highest yielder with YSI. Ecotype KBK1 was the most suitable for Kiboko and Mtwapa
sites and MGD3 for Buchuma.

Evaluation of farmer knowledge and perceptions on ecotypes of C. ciliaris grass species was
carried out using Focused group Discussions (FGDs) where farmers developed criteria for
preferred grass types. The farmers knew of the existence of various ecotypes of C. ciliaris and had
varied perceived preferences on them. TVT1 and KLF1 ecotypes were selected by over 80 % of
the participants due to their perceived tolerance to droughts and heavy grazing. The criteria for
selection of ecotypes by farmers varied depending on the type of utilization of the grass. Successful
development and promotion of grass varieties should consider the mode of utilization by the target
farmer group";"Kirwa, Everlyne C";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2019-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/106671";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/106671/Kirwa_Evaluation%20of%20Grass%20Ecotypes%20for%20Potential%20Use%20in%20Reseeding%20of%20Pastoral%20Fields%20in%20the%20Arid%20and%20Semi-arid%20Lands%20of%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"";"Arid and Semi-arid Lands";""

Consequently, they take back years of development, thus posing a major challenge to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals especially the target of halving extreme poverty by 2015 and Kenya's set development goals as contained in Vision 2030. The nature of natural disasters in Kenya especially landslides has constantly eroded the recovery capacity of communities especially in the affected areas, hence affecting their economic development year in year out. This requires more vigorous attention and planning to mitigate the effects as they have impacted greatly on the country's fight against poverty and efforts to reduce the number of people living below the poverty line. The economic cost of the impact of landslides in the past has been estimated in millions of shillings. This chapter provides a background on landslides in Kenya, the most common locations/areas affected by landslides in Kenya, factors contributing to vulnerability to landslides in Kenya, and economic and social impacts of landslides in Kenya. The impact of such hazards is compounded by poverty and lack of adequate resources to develop the affected areas, rendering the populations more vulnerable. The chapter highlights on the need to take up a proactive strategy in the management of natural disasters in Kenya, which would improve the coping capacity of communities, lessen the impact, and therefore improve the lives of Kenyans in the areas prone to harsh weather conditions. A clear vision for future actions is inevitably necessary to set the pace for development aimed at mitigating the impact of landslides in Kenya, thereby improving the lives of communities in Kenya.";"Maina-Gichaba, Charles

These values averaged 6.35, 4.67, and 3.03% for A. senegal var. kerensis, leiorhachis, and senegal, respectively, and were lower than those of the adjacent reference species. There were also significant differences in the amount of N2 fixed (%Ndfa) among the varieties. A. senegal var. senegal showed the highest levels of N2 fixation with a mean of 36% while A. senegal var. kerensis and leiorhachis had equal estimates of 25%. However, no nodules were observed in the collected soil samples. Leaf N values were significantly different among the varieties with a mean of 2.73, 2.46, and 4.03% for A. senegal var. kerensis, leiorhachis, and senegal, respectively. This study shows that the three varieties of A. senegal are able to fix N2 in their natural ecosystems and the differences could probably be due to soil properties and nutrient availability under the different environments. The species can hence be utilized as plantations in agriculture and land rehabilitation programs.";"Eunice, Githae

on soil health and soil biodiversity, use of
biological methods has become most acceptable
alternative methods for farmers to control soil

therefore undertaken to determine the occurrence of
nematode destroying fungi in Taita Taveta with the
aim of isolating and characterizing them for biological
control of plant parasitic nematodes. Twenty eight
fungal isolates, distributed in three genera, were
identified as nematode destroying fungi from all the
positive soil samples. Out of the isolates that were
identified, 71, 25 and 4 % were in the genera
Arthrobotrys, Monacrosporium and Nematoctonus
respectively. Arthrobotrys oligospora had an
occurrence frequency of 42.9% which was the highest
followed by A. dactyloides, M.cionopagum,

fungi was affected by land use and organic inputs (P ≤
0.05) while it was not affected by crop rotation (P ≥
0.05). Napier land use was more diverse than the other
land uses with a mean shannon diversity index of
0.717 followed by horticulture (index 0.497). Maize

support a rich biological diversity, including 40% of all bird species. However, these rain
forests have been shrinking due to increasing rate of deforestation, fragmentation, and other
forms of resource exploitation. Degradation and loss of rainforests has threatened their rich
biological diversity and the life-support systems. However, the rate at which birds are
displaced by forest clearing and the potential for birds' conservation on farmlands are not
well understood. This study sought to establish the role of farmlands adjacent to tropical
rainforests in birds' conservation. The study was carried out for the period of seven months
(September 2010-March 2011) in small scale farms lying between two forests (Kakamega
main and Kisere) in Kakamega County, Kenya. The objectives were to determine the
cropping systems in farmlands adjacent to Kakamega forest determine the spatial and
temporal variability of birds' habitats in Kakamega, assess the relative abundance of birds
found in different cropping systems in the study area and to determine the variability in the
community structure of bird guilds in the study area. Information on crop cover types, crop
growth stages and estimates of percentage cover was obtained. Data on bird species
composition, diversity, richness and abundance in the identified habitats were collected
through timed species counts, conducted in a circular plots of 35m radius. Individual birds
were counted, identified and classified into feeding guilds. Their foraging sites were also
noted by crop cover and flight height levels present at the sampling sites. Sampling of birds
was done twice a week and crop growth stages were evaluated twice a month. Three major
habitat types (sugarcane farms without trees, sugarcane farms with trees and farms with
mixed crops) were identified. A total of 17,397 birds belonging to 126 species were found in
all habitats. Bird species richness was variable among the various cover types while species diversity remained relatively stable (Shannon diversity' H'=3.1 and H'=3.5). There was
difference (X2=6, df=5, p < 0.05) in number of birds in different bird guilds, insectivorous
having the highest number while the nectivorous contained the lowest number. Similarly, the
birds showed preference for top height level than the middle and the bottom levels (X2=3,
df=2, p < 0.05). Birds utilized various crop stages opportunistically and hence monthly
differences were not significant (dmax P > 0.05). Farmlands in the study area hosted a rich
community of birds, some of which utilized the adjacent tropical rainforest. It was also found
that farmlands provided refuge for displaced species and the presence of indigenous trees and
fruits appeared to offer favorable feeding and breeding opportunities. Bottom height level
was, however, unstable because of the manipulations by the land owners. Nevertheless, this
study showed that the mixed farming landscape in Kakamega offered ample potential for
birds' conservation provided that key habitats remain stable and are enriched with tree crops";"Editruda, Alfred M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2011-11-30";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/14365";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/14365/Mbegu%20-%20Comparative%20Study%20Of%20Bird%20Guilds%20In%20Different%20Cropping%20Systems%20On%20Farm%20Lands%20Adjacent%20To%20Kakamega%20Forest.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/14365/Mbegu%20-%20Comparative%20Study%20Of%20Bird%20Guilds%20In%20Different%20Cropping%20Systems%20On%20Farm%20Lands%20Adjacent%20To%20Kakamega%20Forest.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Comparative study;Bird guilds;Cropping systems;Farm lands;Kakamega forest";""

Its purpose was to establish the direction and magnitude of change that had occurred among the resettled farmers, socially and economically.To achieve that goal, it became necessary to document and analyze the socio-economic changes among the settlers in the scheme. The demonstration model was the theoretical orientation that was used to guide and inform this study. It presupposes that for any meaningful changes to be effected, government change agents such as veterinary and agricultural extension workers should have dialogue with the farmers. It is indicated that the demonstration model is viable for planned social change. The methodology that was used to collect data in this study was documentary library search, focus group discussion, interviews and participant observation methods. The respondents were randomly selected using systematic random sampling, in which every 5th household head was interviewed. The household was the unit of analysis.The findings indicate that, on the overall, Abagusii farmers in Nyansiongo settlement have undergone significant socioeconomic transformations. They enjoy a higher standard of living than they did in the pre-settlement area. They now have bigger pieces of land that they utilize in the production of more food and cash crops. Most of them derive adequate income from their farming activities which they invest in both farming and non-farming ventures. It was also established that, socially, there settlers have to a large extent adapted to the new environment by leading lifestyles that tend to be urban oriented, characterized by investing in the environment, being more individualistic and self-reliant.

cotton,
• To identify the relationship between levels of household food security
in relation to income and expenditure,
• To investigate women's access to income from cotton production, their
food production and food security roles,

Quantitative Data was analyzed using SPSS Computer package which
generated the percentages and frequencies for interpretation. Qualitative
data was also analyzed.
It emerged from the findings that cash crop farming has had negative
impact on food security as a result of neglect of indigenous subsistence
farming which are drought resistant and livestock keeping, which provide
a whole year-round household food security.
Farmers have dedicated their efforts to the cash crop at the expense of
subsistence farming consequently affecting household food security.

Numerous accidents occur in quarries across Kenya leading to deaths of 30 people annually. Mining is an activity presenting a plethora of environmental, social and economic problems thus using abandoned quarries as sites for new construction is a useful form of reclamation, one that has occurred throughout history.
Reclamation of degraded landscapes in developing countries is an environmental issue that is under consideration. Human activities have intensified thus disturbing the ecological balance and decreasing the availability of viable land. Environmentalists have come up with policies to tackle degradation and its effects globally. This drive was mainly inspired by the conservation strategies developed and promoted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).
The proposed research is intended to provide planning approaches and design guidelines for integrated and sustainable development that would be more responsive, repurposing former quarry sites for community recreation needs and aspirations.
A case study approach is used, to give sustainable measures that most countries have adopted for projects of this nature. Different methods of degraded land rehabilitation activities will be discussed through a critical interrogation of existing literature and field experiences. The resulting study is expected to proffer solutions that ameliorate challenges facing today’s landscape designer.

These changes can mainly be attributed to increased livestock populations and the response of the increased human population to both local and exogenous opportunities and constraints. This study was carried out in Kibwezi district of Kenya mainly inhabited by agro-pastoralists. The main objective of this study was to establish how different land use types influence soil properties in tropical semi-arid rangelands.
Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples from three land use types namely cultivated land (CL), grazing land (GL) and fallow land (FL) at a depth of 15-30cm were collected and analyzed using standard laboratories for soil nutrients and soil physical properties. Results show open grazing lands (CEC 19.59 meq/100g) to be more fertile than cultivated (13.88 meq/100g) and fallow (6.40 meq/100g) lands. This was attributed to the continuous dropping of faecal material by grazing livestock. Higher bulk density in
grazing land (1.36 g/cm3) compared to cultivated and fallow lands with 1.29 g/cm3 and 1.33 g/cm3 was attributed to the hoof action of livestock. These results suggest that different land use types in the semi-arid rangelands contribute immensely to soil properties.";"Mganga, Kevin Z.

Formerly large-scale farms converted into smallholder farms and plantation forests have gradually been lost. These changes in soil use have brought in different soil use and management approaches that have triggered soil erosion and other forms of land degradation. Up to 8.6 Kg of soil, loss per hectare from the cultivated soils has reportedly been lost in one storm. This massive soil loss was probably due to reduced aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity. The objective of this study was to trace the changes in soil use and determine their effects on aggregate stability, organic matter and hydraulic conductivity. The study undertook a semi detailed soil survey of the watershed through a three-tier approach comprising image interpretation, ﬁeld surveys and laboratory analysis. The measured variables in the soil were analysed using a two - way ANOVA and correlation analysis. The study found the major land uses to be forest, agriculture, grassland, and Wetland, and also observed a strong soil — landscape relationship within the Watershed. Soils of slopes were moderately to severely eroded, shallow and les developed whereas those on summits, pen plains, uplands, plateaus and valleys were deep and well developed. Aggregate stability Was in the order of forests > grasslands > agriculture Wetland. The mean Weight diameter in various land uses Was 0.68, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.41 respectively. Hydraulic conductivity Was in the order of forests > agriculture > grasslands > wetland. Hydraulic conductivity significantly correlated negatively With bulk density and Lay content. We concluded that land use changes that reduced the amount of organic matter significantly reduced aggregate stability. In addition, soil use and management activities that reduced organic matter content signiﬁcantly lowered hydraulic conductivity and therefore likely to contribute to erosion and other forms of land degradation.";"Mainuri, ZG

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of land fragmentation and agro-ecological zones (AEZs) on food security and farm efficiency in Kenya. The study used data collected from 384 farm-households that were randomly selected from three AEZs in the Embu County, using a multistage stratified sampling technique. The three agro-ecological zones were the Sunflower, Coffee and the Tea zones, based on the official AEZs classification system in Kenya. The status of household food security was determined using household caloric acquisition method which was used to compute a household food security index (HFSI). Farm efficiency was measured using stochastic frontier method. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multinomial Logit Regression Analysis were used to evaluate the effect of land fragmentation on food security and farm efficiency. The effect of land fragmentation on household food security was found to be negative in the Sunflower and Tea zones, but not in the Coffee Zone. Further, it was found that the minimum farm-size that could ensure the attainment of threshold level of household food security (HFSI = 1) was above 2 ha in the Sunflower Zone and 0.5 ha in the Tea Zone. Land fragmentation was found to have a positive effect on farm efficiency in the Coffee and Tea zones, but not in the Sunflower Zone. For assurance of sustainable food security in Embu County, this study based on its findings recommends that further fragmentation of farms below the minimum size for attainment of threshold level of household food security should be discouraged. For the farms that are already below the minimum cut-off size for food security, measures to increase these farms‟ productivities so that they can support more people per ha should be devised and implemented.

Other measures that should be taken to improve food security are increased technology adoption, farmer training, market and road infrastructure and credit.";"Ndirangu, Samuel N";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"food security;land fragmentation";"Land & Food Security";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/103003";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/103003/Ndirangu_An%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Effect%20of%20Land%20Fragmentation%20and%20Agro-ecological%20Zones%20on%20Food%20Security%20and%20Farm%20Efficiency-%20the%20Case%20of%20Embu%20County%20in%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/103003/Ndirangu_An%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20Effect%20of%20Land%20Fragmentation%20and%20Agro-ecological%20Zones%20on%20Food%20Security%20and%20Farm%20Efficiency-%20the%20Case%20of%20Embu%20County%20in%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=6&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Land Fragmentation and Agro-ecological";""
"uonbi:11295/35041";"The effect of narrow grass strips in controlling soil erosion and runoff on sloping land";"";"The study was carried out on twelve runoff
plots installed at Kabete Campus Field Station,
University of Nairobi, on a 10% natural slope of
eutric Nitisol to assess the effect of grass strips
in controlling soil loss and runoff on sloping land.
Four treatments, a control plot without grass strip
and three different widths (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m.) of
Nandi setaria (Setaria anceps), were tested under
natural rainfall during 1982 and 1983, simulated
runoff, and simulated rainfall of 80 mm/hr.
Results showed that the treatment effect was
highly significant in reducing both soil loss and
runoff under natural rainfall. Annual soil loss
for the control plot was 97.7 t/ha. while for the
0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m. wide grass strips annual soil
losses were 35.4, 35.6 and 17.8 t/ha. (36, 36 and
18%) respectively. Annual runoff from the control
plot was 100~. (20%) and percentage runoff for
the 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m. wide grass strips were
56, 44 and 24% of the control piot, respectively.
The difference between the three different grass
strip widths was not stat~stically significant
although annual soil loss from the 0.5 m. wide
grass strip was double that from the 1.5 m. wide
grass strip.
The simulated runoff test showed that soil
losses from the plot with 0.5 m. wide grass strip
were only 4.5, 7.8 and 41.1% of the soil losses
from the control plot under the three application
. -4 -4 -4
rates of 1.5 x 10 ,2.5 x 10 and 3.6 x 10
3 -1 m s respectively •• Runoff from the 0.5 m. wide
grass strip were 1.9, 3.5 and 50.2% of the runoff
from the control plot for the same application
rates.
Under heavy simulated rainfall, soil losses
from the plot with 1.5 m. wide grass strip were
17.1, 25.1 and 36.7% of the soil losses from the
control plot for dry, wet and very wet antecedent
soil moisture conditions, respectively. Runoff from
the plot with 1.5 m. wide grass strip were 32.7, 41.0
and 46.0% of the runoff from the control plot for the
same three applications. Efficiency of grass
strips in controlling soil loss and runoff
increased from the 0.5m. wide grass strip to
1.5 m. wide grass strip and decreased from the dry
to very wet antecedent soil moisture conditions.
Strip width was exponentially related to soil
loss and runoff with coefficient of determination
(r2) of 0.96 for soil loss and 0.88 for runoff
under dry antecedent soil moisture condition.
Sediment was deposited on the plots with grass
strips, with most of the deposition taking place
on the uphill edge of the grass strip, extending two
metres in one and half years. There was little
deposition in the grass strips. The maximum mean
depth of deposition was 7.6 cm. at the 0.5 m. wide
grass strip. Much of scour took place on the upper
section of the plots. In almost all the plots
the ground slope was reduced by about 2%
Two thirds of sediment transported was in sand
size aggregates although the soil contained more
than 50% clay. Grass strips had no influence in
the trapping of different sized aggregates.
Of the six erosivity indices tested, the amount
of storm (A), in mm., was highly correlated
(r = 0.88) with soil loss followed by the El1S(r=0.86)
and the EI30 (r=O.73) indices. The KE> 25 index gave
the least correlation coefficient (r=O.41). The

"uonbi:11295/100354";"Assessing the Effectiveness of the National Land Commision in Addressing Irregular and Illegal Allocation of Land in Kenya";"";"Irregular and Illegal allocation of land is a major component of the land question is in Kenya.
The land question is a major rhetoric as it is not one issue but a myriad of issues entrenched in
archaic, pre colonial administrative methods and systems which led to lack of transparency and
abuse of high held offices in the self interest of individuals as pertaining to land. The targets for
fulfilling such self interests were public land and land that could not be acknowledged by law for
the simple and erroneous fact that the law did not allow for the means of acknowledgment by
affording the custodians of such land the luxury of registration. Indeed the effects of such
systems were to be felt decades later and brought out in broad daylight by such painful
happenstance as the post election violence of 2007. Many stakeholders championed the land
reforms as the answer to the land question. The issues needed addressing and the national land
policy was birthed, intricately identifying and detailing the issues marring the then land regime
and recommending curative measures.
The Constitution of Kenya promulgated in 2010 embedded the core values of the land policy
giving the government the mandate to see to it that land in Kenya is managed in a manner that is
equitable, efficient, productive and sustainable. Different laws were therefore enacted and the
land regime equipped with the institutional capacity to see this through. The National Land
Commission was the ‘saviour’ institution. This study has a general objective of assessing the
effectiveness of the National Land Commission in addressing illegal/irregular land allocations in
Kenya. The specific objectives include establishing the extent to which the commission has
managed to deal with illegal/irregular land allocations four years since its inception and the
forms of such allocations while detailing the challenges it faces. The study also reviewed the
current laws relating to illegal/irregular land allocations. The research methodology involved the
use of qualitative and quantitative data with desktop research taking the bulk of the data
supplemented with interviews conducted on Ministry of Land officers from the relevant
departments that deal with allocation of land. The study found that there exists a Constitutional
and legislative framework that is ill-prepared to curb illegal and irregular land allocations; lack
of a critical mass of political goodwill and the obscure mandate of the National Land
Commission; and, the capacity of the National Land Commission to investigate historical land
injustices having been tied to Parliament’s legislative discretion and political whims.It therefore
recommended the establishment of a fund account for the National Land Commission as well as
a raft of Constitutional and legislative amendments, not only to reinforce National Land
Commission’s institutional capacity to address the problem, but also to expand its scope to cover
the management of community land. It also recommended speedy digitization of land records.";"Atieno, Betty";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/100354";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100354/Atieno%20Betty_Assessing%20the%20Effectiveness%20of%20the%20National%20Land%20Commision%20in%20Addressing%20Irregular%20and%20Illegal%20Allocation%20of%20Land%20in%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100354/Atieno%20Betty_Assessing%20the%20Effectiveness%20of%20the%20National%20Land%20Commision%20in%20Addressing%20Irregular%20and%20Illegal%20Allocation%20of%20Land%20in%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Assessing the Effectiveness of the National Land Commision";""
"uonbi:11295/24604";"Impact of land use and cover change on soil quality And pasture productivity in semi-arid rangelands: the Case of Nakasongola district, Uganda";"";"The impact of land use and cover change on soil quality and pasture production was investigated in the rangelands of Nakasongola District, Uganda. Landsat (TM) images of 1986 and 1990 and Landsat (ETM+) of 2000 and 2004 for Nakasongola District were used to determine the extent and patterns of land use and cover change using the Integrated Land and Water Information Systems (ILWIS) 3.6 software. A modified-Whittaker sampling design was used to collect soil and pasture samples in three land cover types (bare, herbaceous and woody) under three production systems (settled, semi-settled and non-settled). The soil samples were analyzed for selected chemical and physical properties while pasture samples were oven dried for biomass yield. Analysis of variance, discriminant analysis and principle component analysis were conducted using XL-Stat software to differentiate the sites and ascertain the effects of different land cover and use types on soil properties, Multivariate analysis for 18 properties of soil was conducted for physical (5), chemical (7), organic matter (3) and aggregate stability (3) for the upper 15 cm of soil which were combined into a single general indicator of soil quality (GISQ). , The area covered by grassland decreased by 13.1% from 90,020 ha in 1986 to 78,199 ha in 2004. Between 1986 and 1990, much of the grasslands were converted into bush land (38,608 ha), woodland (19,659 ha) and cropland (9,159 ha) while between 1990 and 2000, 21,838, 5,912 and 4,506 ha of grassland were converted to woodland, cropland and bush land respectively and between 2000 and 2004, 33,354, ha were converted to woodland, 12,029 ha to bush land and 6,114 to crop land. In general, bush and woody encroachment engulfed approximately 65%, 50% vi and 54% of grasslands III the periods of 1986 - 1990, 1990 - 2000 and 2000 - 2004, respectively. Soils from bare land under non-settled production systems had significantly high levels of clay (p<0.0001) and bulk density (p<0.02). Soil from herbaceous vegetation had significantly high levels of organic matter and total nitrogen (p < 0.001) compared to woody and bare soils, while soils from woody vegetation had significantly high levels of available Phosphorus (p < 0.04). The semi-settled production system had high levels of pH (p < 0.04), Ca (p < 0.038) and CEC (p < 0.001) compared to the settled and non-settled systems. Basing on chemical and physical properties, soils from herbaceous vegetation were very distinct from those of bare ground but were 72% similar to soils under woody cover. When the equation for calculation of the General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) was developed (GISQ = 0.015PHYSICAL +,O.02CHEMICAL + 0.0170RGANIC MATTER + 0.024AGGREGATE STABILITY) and applied to all sites, GISQ was significantly affected by production system (p < 0.05) and the interaction between production system and cover (p < 0.001). Herbaceous cover under semi-settled production systems had the highest GISQ of 0.64 that ranged from 0.41 - 1.00, while bare cover under non-settled systems had the lowest GISQ of 0.23 that ranged from 0.1 - 0.53. Most soils had lower levels of organic matter and soil nutrients and thus the generally low GISQ. Pasture biomass yield was significantly different between cover types (p < 0.0001), with high biomass in herbaceous (2019 kg/ha) and least in bare. Production systems also had significantly vii different (p < 0.013) biomass yield, highest in settled (1266 kg/ha) and least in semi-settled (953 kg/ha). Biomass yield was more associated with high levels of OM (r = 0.91), Ca (r = 0.91), Mg (0.83), N (r = 0.77) and base saturation (r = 0.88) and were therefore identified as the most critical soil nutrients limiting pasture production, The results indicated that the rate at which grassland cover is lost to other land use and cover types is greater than the rate of grassland expansion meaning that grasslands are at the verge of disappearing if no conservation measures .are instituted to protect them. Grasslands have been degraded to levels below their recuperative capacity and therefore rehabilitation back to herbaceous cover would require more time and external investments. The soils in Nakasongola are generally very strongly acidic (average of pH = 4.5) and therefore improving soil pH and addition of organic matter are major soil 'management practices that should be undertaken to increase pasture biomass yield in the degraded rangeland ecosystems. From this study, semi settled production systems and herbaceous vegetation cover have been identified as the most appropriate land use and cover types for the semi-arid rangelands of Nakasongola District in terms of sustainable soil quality conservation and pasture production.";"Zziwa, Emmanuel";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2011-12-31";"en";"land use;rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/24604";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/24604/Zziwa_Impact%20of%20Land%20Use%20and%20Cover%20Change%20on%20Soil%20Quality%20and%20Pasture%20Productivity%20in%20Semi-arid%20Rangelands%20the%20Case%20of%20Nakasongola%20District%2c%20Uganda.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/24604/Zziwa_Impact%20of%20Land%20Use%20and%20Cover%20Change%20on%20Soil%20Quality%20and%20Pasture%20Productivity%20in%20Semi-arid%20Rangelands%20the%20Case%20of%20Nakasongola%20District%2c%20Uganda.pdf.jpg?sequence=10&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Impact of land use and cover change on soil quality;Pasture productivity in semi-arid rangelands";""

mobility was used as a coping strategy. Households rich in livestock applied the herd mobility strategy
more than the poorer ones by moving a larger proportion of their herds. Poorer households applied the
strategy of keeping drought resistant animals more than richer ones by having a higher proportion of
goats and sheep than cattle. Institutional land units of Kiboko Range Research Station and Chyulu

quantity of surface water and groundwater resources in Lake Nakuru and Lake Elmenteita areas.
Multiple linear regression analysis of the variables was done using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) to achieve this objective. Population grows in the area at the rate of 3.4% to
4.5% while natural vegetation cover is diminishing at 2.5% annually. There is constant rise in
daily minimum temperature while there is a rise in the mean annual precipitation. The area’s
domestic water demand per capita is projected to rise from 50 litres per day in 1971 to 160 litres
per day in 2030. This, based on the rate of population growth, will translate to a soaring total
demand of 174,000,000 m3 annually by the year 2030.
Strong positive correlation between precipitation and discharge is observed, indicating that
rainfall is the main source of surface water in the area. The precipitation is thus expected to
influence the occurrence of extreme events, with droughts projected for the year 2001, 2012,
2016, 2021 and 2028 while floods are projected to occur in 2006, 2009, 2018, 2024 and 2030.
To mitigate against the deteriorating surface and groundwater resources in the area, there is need
to restore Mau escarpment since it is the most affected. Resettlement of the inhabitants will be
key to ensuring sustainable water supply. The reforestation of Mau catchment should take into
account promoting cross-breeding to produce superior tree species. These species should be fastmaturing,
heat-and-drought tolerant and pest-and-disease-resistant.
Measures that are recommended to reduce green house gas emissions and vegetation loss
include slowing deforestation, enhancing natural forest generation, establishing tree plantation,
promoting agroforestry and altering management of agricultural soils and rangelands. Enhanced
resilience to future periods of drought stress can be supported by improvements in present rainfed
farming systems, such as water harvesting systems to supplement irrigation practices in dry
areas. Improved early warning systems and their application may also reduce vulnerability to
future risks associated with climate variability and change. Increased investment in dams will
improve harvesting of water that would cause flooding during heavy rains. This would later be
used to mitigate against the effects of droughts.";"ADEDE, DAVID OMONDI";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2011-12-31";"en";"area;land cover";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/9870";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/9870/Adede_Potential%20Effects%20Of%20Changes%20In%20Climate%2c%20Land%20Cover%20And%20Population%20On%20The%20Quantity%20Of%20Water%20Resources%20In%20Lake%20Nakuru%20And%20Lake%20Elmenteita%20Areas%2c%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/9870/Adede_Potential%20Effects%20Of%20Changes%20In%20Climate%2c%20Land%20Cover%20And%20Population%20On%20The%20Quantity%20Of%20Water%20Resources%20In%20Lake%20Nakuru%20And%20Lake%20Elmenteita%20Areas%2c%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Climate changes;Land cover;Water resources;Lake Nakuru;Lake Elimentaita";""

To achieve these objectives, descriptive, Nutrient Index approach and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis methods were used. Results indicate that within a period of five decades, agricultural land use has led to a decline in Total Organic Carbon (-72%), Magnesium (-65%) and Boron (-61%), Iron (-22%) and Total Nitrogen (-15%). The drivers of deterioration identified were cutting across inherent properties such as soil chemical (pH), physical (soil mapping unit) and biological (organic carbon) attributes, farmer practices (agricultural commercialization) and exogenous factors (population density and Agro-ecological zones). The study concludes that indeed conversion of land from natural vegetation is associated with deterioration in soil quality and therefore policy needs to create incentives for the build-up of soil organic matter, replenishment of soil macro and micro nutrients. Blending of commercial fertilizers with targeted micro-nutrients, maintenance of soil conservation techniques and long term fallowing are encouraged.";"Willy, DK

This was prompted by the recent upsurge of land prices in the country and the researcher was particularly interested in Nakuru County. The real estate sector experiences a series of booms and busts and it was therefore important to find out what is causing them. The study aimed to cover several research gaps among them; whether the variables that influence land value in mature markets like Japan are the same in Kenya, and apart from the variables covered by local studies whether other variables like speculative investment demand do influence land prices. The study adopted a descriptive study design and the target population was the land owners in the four wards of Naivasha as shown in the county government of Nakuru records. Sample was obtained using the stratified sampling method to come up with the most representative sample. The dependent variable was the land price while the independent variables were the speculative investment demand, interest rate, proximity to urban center and real GDP. Data was collected from both primary and secondary sources and analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 the model explained only 76.6% of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. ANOVA analysis showed that the probability of the value of 0.000 which was less than 0.05 which indicated that the regression relationship was highly significant in predicting how speculative investment demand, Interest rates, Proximity to urban center and Real GDP influenced the price of land in Nakuru County. The findings of the study showed that all the four independent variables had a significant positive relationship with land prices. The study was therefore similar to studies done both internationally and locally. The researcher therefore recommends that policy makers in government work on increasing the growth of GDP. Commercial banks should lower the lending interest rate so that people can access cheap loans and thus afford to buy land. Lastly, the government should endeavor to tarmac all feeder roads to increase the value of land.";"Wachira, Dennis M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/103095";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/103095/Wachira_Factors%20Influencing%20The%20Price%20Of%20Land%20In%20Nakuru%20County.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/103095/Wachira_Factors%20Influencing%20The%20Price%20Of%20Land%20In%20Nakuru%20County.pdf.jpg?sequence=6&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Price Of Land In Nakuru County";""

"uonbi:11295/11253";"Macrofauna diversity and abundance across different land use systems in Embu, Kenya";"";"This paper presents data on diversity and abundance of soil macrofauna of various land use systems in Embu, Kenya (natural forest, plantation forest, fallow, coffee, tea, napier, and maize). Each was sampled for macrofauna using three sampling methods (monolith,
transect and pitfall traps). Thirty four (34) genera/species of soil macrofauna were recorded, the highest number (27) being observed in napier. Majority of these genera/species being Coleoptera. Rényi diversity profile indicated that in terms of
species richness (α at 0), maize was the richest of all the land use systems, but plantation forest the least. It was however not possible to clearly order or rank the land use system in terms of diversity because of the bias of each of the two diversity indices as indicated
by the numerous crossings observed for the diversity profiles/curves. Shannon index of diversity (α = 1) indicated that coffee was the most diverse of the land use systems followed by plantation forest > natural forest > napier > maize > tea, while fallow/pasture was the least diverse (Figure 1). On the other hand, Simpson’s diversity (α = 2) indicated that plantation forest was the most diverse followed by fallowed by coffee > natural forest > napier > maize >tea > fallow/pasture. Rényi evenness profile indicated that the plantation forest was most even in terms of species distribution followed by natural forest and coffee > napier > tea > maize but least even in the fallow/pasture. Hymenoptera were most abundant of the macrofauna groups constituting about 45% of the total followed by Isoptera (39%), Coleoptera (6%), Oligochaeta (5%), Orthoptera (3%) and Arenae (2%).
The other groups that comprised of Hemiptera, Diptera, Phasmidae and Blattelidae each constituted <1% of the total marofauna recorded. Highest macrofauna density (1566) was recorded in the napier followed by fallow (1356) > coffee (1170) > natural forest (1110) > tea (755), but lowest in plantation forest (309), although analysis of variance indicated no
significant variation among the land use systems. This study however, demonstrates that quantitative changes in diversity and density of soil fauna communities occur when various land use systems are subjected to varying levels of intensification. These changes appear to be associated with management practices such as use of agrochemicals, consequent destruction of nesting habitats, modification of soil microclimate within habitats, removal of substrate, low diversity and availability of food sources for the associated macrofauna groups. The significant correlations between some soil macrofauna groups with selected soil chemical properties shows that, soil chemical characteristics may indirectly play a role in influencing the density, distribution and structure of macrofauna communities.

"uonbi:11295/97758";"Factors Influencing Land Ownership by Women: Case of Khwisero Constituency, Kakamega County, Kenya";"";"There has been progress in terms of legislation of land ownership and women rights on the same subject in Kenya and a number of Non-Governmental Organizations and Civil Society Organizations are in the fore front promoting women land ownership. It is noted that women play an integral part in food production for their families however, land tenure system in the rural areas discriminates against women hence very few women own land. The overall purpose of this study was to establish various interventions that the state and community can adopt to ensure that women gain support in accessing owning and controlling land, an essential factor of production. The objectives of this study were to assess the influence of access to information on women land rights on women land ownership, to examine the influence of land administration patterns on women land ownership, analyse the social economic impacts of women land rights and assess the role of culture in realizing women land rights. The study focused on the factors that promote women land rights by examining the global and national context in the quest to realize women land and property rights. Relevant literature was reviewed to ascertain the state of women land ownership and study gaps were identified. The study employed descriptive survey research design that was both quantitative and qualitative in nature adopting a participatory approach. The target population was 46390. Primary data was obtained using questionnaires, Focus group discussion guides, key informant guides and literature review including observation. Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyze data. 396 respondents participated through random sampling. The data output is presented in form of tables. The research findings show that access to information influences women land ownership, it also came out clear that land administration patterns contribute to realization of women land ownership, it was also found out that socio-economic as well as cultural factors influence women land ownership. Other factors that emerged included the fact that some women did not want to own land feeling that it will break family ties and the fact that women get married therefore they should not inherit land in their fathers‘ homes. It also emanated that regular training on women land rights was necessary since a good number of respondents said they did not know any women land right and even the constitutional provisions were not understood thus simpler versions should be provided. However, the same was attributed to the retrogressive culture still existing in the society. Women empowerment issue also came up as a factor leading to improved society hence allowing them to own land is one of the indicators of empowerment. Based on the findings the research recommends that to promote women land ownership, the following should be done: Training on women land rights right from primary schools to the local communities and this means that there should be inclusion of the study of women land rights in the primary school curriculum, Non-Governmental Organizations and Faith Based Organizations together with Civil Society Organizations dealing in women rights should concentrate on awareness creation and always refresh the target group as often as possible to make it a norm, the Government and NGO world should look for a way litigation can be made free to women seeking justice on land rights and that the law makers should come up with a law prohibiting the cultural practices that hinder women from land ownership not just as a paper but sensitize people on it and ensure it is followed. The study concludes with confidence level of 95% that women land ownership is influenced by factors as access to information, land administration patterns, socio-economic and cultural factors.";"Ireri, Josephine, W";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-12-31";"en";"land ownership;women";"Land & Gender";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/97758";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/97758/Ireri%20Josephine_Factors%20Influencing%20Land%20Ownership%20by%20Women-%20Case%20of%20Khwisero%20Constituency%2c%20Kakamega%20County%2c%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/97758/Ireri%20Josephine_Factors%20Influencing%20Land%20Ownership%20by%20Women-%20Case%20of%20Khwisero%20Constituency%2c%20Kakamega%20County%2c%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=11&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Factors Influencing Land Ownership by Women";""
"uonbi:11295/95038";"An analysis of land use potential in arid and semi-arid areas: - central location, isiolo county";"";"Arid and semi-arid areas are part of the global ecosystem that completes the whole. Despite their aridity conditions, ASALs are endowed with a variety of resources ranging from fertile soils, minerals, oil, wildlife, and rivers among others. The maintenance of land productivity in these fragile environments is a particular concern for many countries with large portions of their land in arid areas. This study which has been contextualised in Isiolo, Central location aims at analysing the land use potential with the aim of ensuring optimal utilisation. The study specifically concentrates on establishing the existing resource, land use patterns and practices in the area, the factors behind the current resource use, patterns and practices as well as the implications on the socio-economic and environmental well-being. The study further seeks to make recommendations on how to expand the carrying capacity of the area by optimally utilizing the existing resources. The study employed non-experimental research method which utilised both secondary and primary data. Secondary data was obtained from books, journals, government publications among others. Primary data was obtained through field survey. A sample size of 154 people was used. Key informants from the local administration and relevant institutions were also involved. Sampling method which involved purposive sampling, convenient sampling as well as simple random sampling was applied in selecting the case study, formulating clusters and administering household questionnaires respectively. During data analysis, the study employed methods such spread sheets for quantitative data, statistical package for social scientists for qualitative data and Geographic Information System for spatial data among others. The study revealed that Isiolo is endowed with various resource potential ranging from natural wealth and indigenous knowledge among others. The main land use practices in the area are pastoralism and subsistence crop farming. It was further established that the region has dispersed settlements patterns which are lacking basic infrastructure services. The study established that research and policy is not adequately responsive to the resource use, land use pattern and practices, which are purely cultural driven. This has had implications such as food insecurity, environmental degradation and ethnic conflicts. The study therefore sought to close the gap posed by weak settlement systems as well as declining carrying capacity in the light of existing resources. To fill the gap, the study recommends an integrated three tier model aimed at creating sustainable rural settlements, diversifying the rural economic basis while developing and optimizing agriculture as a unique economic sector in ASALs.";"Kisiangani, Rachel,N";"";"";"University of Nairobi";"2015-06-30";"en";"area;land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/95038";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/95038/Kisiangani%20Rachel%2cN_An%20analysis%20of%20land%20use%20potential%20in%20arid%20and%20semi-arid%20areas%20-%20central%20location%2c%20isiolo%20county.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/95038/Kisiangani%20Rachel%2cN_An%20analysis%20of%20land%20use%20potential%20in%20arid%20and%20semi-arid%20areas%20-%20central%20location%2c%20isiolo%20county.pdf.jpg?sequence=14&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land use potential in arid and semi-arid areas";""
"uonbi:11295/34646";"Does Access To Land Have A Positive Impact On The Food Situation Of The Urban Poor? : A Case Study In Nairobi";"";"In order to make ends meet, many poor urban households in sub-Saharan Africa fall back on farming activities, either within the city boundaries or in the rural areas from which they come. The central question raised in this article is whether access to farmland influences a household's food situation. The findings come from a study on urban agriculture in Korogocho, one of two slum areas in Nairobi, Kenya, where a survey was conducted in 1994. The results suggest that access to land does have a positive impact on the welfare situation of urban households, although not necessarily on the food situation as well. Nonetheless, households with access to a rural plot seem to be better off than households without access to any land, at least in terms of the overall food situation as perceived by the respondents themselves. In addition, households with access to a rural plot only also seem to be better off than those with access to only an urban plot. This would imply that access to rural land is more favorable for a household's food situation than access to urban land. The fact that half of the very poor households in Korogocho claiming to have access to rural land did not use that land themselves further suggests that the situation may be more complex than is generally assumed.

irrigated agriculture in the group ranch is leading to increased conflicts and competition for land and other critical
resources. This study used semi – structured interviews with group ranch members on their interactions with wildlife,
resource use and access, land use changes and livelihoods. Most group ranch members practiced agriculture as opposed to
pastoralism. The community noted that critical resources such as water, pasture, plant resources and space were declining,
and mostly available further from their homes. Members identified agriculture expansion and human development as the
main land use changes. Most members also supported agriculture expansion as well as group ranch subdivision. Even
most members supported wildlife use of their land, they were unhappy about the lack of compensation for losses. Most
members wanted communal wildlife sanctuaries managed by the local community rather than a foreign investor. The
competition for land and its resources due to increasing human population and land use changes is limiting wildlife use of
the group ranch, and hence insularizing Amboseli Park. Potential solution is to have a negotiated land use plan that

It is a factor of production which is core to the economic activities of this country. The advent of settlers and colonialism in East Africa placed land in a high level of importance than before. It is not a unique situation for Kenya. Wars have been fought world over with ownership of land and other resources associated with it being at the center of controversy.
When colonialism set in, many people were displaced from their original homes. After the Second World War indigenous Kenyans discovered that their land had been systematically taken away form them. This saw the beginning of vicious war between the indigenous Kenyans and the colonial government. After independence it was felt that the atrocities committed against indigenous Kenyans as far as land was concerned would be remedied. It never came to pass as the original owners of the eland which had been taken away were not the beneficiaries of the independence.
Since independence there have been calls by Kenyans, politicians, leaders and other stakeholders for new land law regimes. Land law reforms have been piecemeal and of no positive results for ordinary Kenyans. Instead of restitution or remedy, more land injustices have been committed against Kenyans after independence. In late 1988 and the early 1190s fight for law reforms was rejuvenated and for more than a decade solutions seemed to be elusive.
In 2010 Kenyans passed a new Constitution which saw reforms and overhaul of the land laws system achieved. Among hopes in the new Constitution was introduction of Article 67 of the Constitution which set up a National Land Commission and defined its functions. In 2011 the Parliament passed National Land Commission to give effect to Article 67 of the Constitution.
One of the functions of the NLC as set out in the legal instruments was to investigate and make recommendations in respect present and past historical land injustices. It was hoped that these provisions of law were adequate to give the NCL enough powers and instruments in addressing past and historical land injustices sin the country. Since its establishment in 2011 the NLC has not done much in this field.
This paper is set to look at what the NLC would be expected to do in order to discharge its mandate under Article 67(2)(e) of the Constitution and section 5(1)(e) of the National Land Commission Act. Chapters 1 and 2 deal with definition and discussion on land injustices in this country while chapter 3 ad 4 discusses the laws NLC should use in addressing the issues and recommendations.";"Musyoki, Benjamin M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/100286";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100286/Musyoki_Addressing%20Past%20And%20Historical%20Land%20Injustice%20In%20Kenya%2c%20Article%2067%282%29%28E%29%20Of%20The%20Constitution%20And%20Section%205%281%29%28E%29%20Of%20The%20National%20Land%20Commission%20Act.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/100286/Musyoki_Addressing%20Past%20And%20Historical%20Land%20Injustice%20In%20Kenya%2c%20Article%2067%282%29%28E%29%20Of%20The%20Constitution%20And%20Section%205%281%29%28E%29%20Of%20The%20National%20Land%20Commission%20Act.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Historical Land Injustice In Kenya";""

The spatial scenarios represented alternatives that vary between full deforestation and reforestation. Synthetic storm events of depths 40, 60 and 80mm were formulated according to the rainfall patterns and assumed to have durations corresponding to the runoff times of concentration.
The Natural Resource Conservation Service–Curve Number model was used to generate runoff volumes within the sub-catchments, which were subsequently routed downstream to obtain effects in the whole basin. The simulated land cover change impacts were evaluated relative to values obtained from the actual land cover state of the basin in the year2000. From the results, an agricultural land cover scenario consti-
tuting of about 86percent of agriculture indicated increased runoff volumes in the entire basin by about 12percent. An agricultural-forested land cover scenario with 40 and 51percent of forest and agriculture respectively revealed reduced runoff volumes by about 12percent.
Alternatively, a scenario depicting a largely forested land cover state with about 78percent of forests reduced the runoff volumes by about 25percent according to the model estimates. Runoff volumes in the basin were also likely to reduce by about 15percent if the appropriate land cover scenario for the respective sub-catchments were to be assumed for runoff management purposes. Considering the prevalent data
uncertainty, the study effectively highlights the potential hydrological vulnerability of the basin. The results obtained can form a basis for appropriate catchment management of the area.";"Olang, LO

"uonbi:11295/26649";"Computerized land information system as a tool of land record management";"A case study of the land rent section of the Department of Lands, Ministry of Lands and Settlement, Nairobi Kenya";"This project thesis presents a conceptual framework for a land information system that
would result in increased revenue collection from the land rent section of the Department
of Lands, Ministry of Lands and Settlement. It point out the need for a comprehensive
database containing both physical and socio-economic data supported by powerful
analytical capabilities as the basis for effective decision making on land rent for tax
revenue collection.
The Government has admittedly a lot of untapped revenue in the form of unrevised land
rents and land rent defaulters. The land rent section however is crippled by the manual
system of record keeping in all its departments ,and lack of policy instruments for
effective management of information. Information obtained from the land rent section
reveals that there's an outstanding arrears in land rent to the tune of Kenya Shilling
4,8.00,000,000 (Four Billion, Eight Million Shillings) or US$ 60,000,000 (Forty eight
million dollars). Land rent ,has not been taken seriously by many leaseholders due to the
Government's laxity in revising and collecting it.
The researcher has identified the type and nature of problems of land rent determination,
record management and collection. A conceptual model showing the components of a
computerized land information system has been analyzed and potential benefits and
possible solutions to the problems outlined using selected properties from the Nairobi hill
area. The possibilities of using land information as a corporate resource have also been
explored.
To achieve the above objectives, the researcher conducted oral interviews with personnel
from the land rent section and other departments that influence the determination of land
rent like the valuers and land officers. Several leaseholders were interviewed with the
view of determining the level of awareness of the need to pay land rent. The model for a
computerized land information system was then developed using a digitized map of the
selected area of study and available socio-economic data on these properties. The level of awareness of the need to pay land rent was analysed usmg statistical
methods of data analysis. Capabilities of the computerised land information system were
then analysed and the findings compared to the current manual system of record
collection to draw results. Possible solutions to the p~dentified in using the
manual system have also been addressed.
The researcher recommends after analysis of the findings that there be a general rent
review for all leasehold properties within the country using computer aided valuation
methods with an emphasis on Multiple Regression Analysis. There is need to educate
leaseholders on the importance of prompt payment of land rent. Automation of land rent
records is the viable solution to the multiplicity of preblems currently faced by the
section as regards retrieval of information and management of land rent records. All these
recommendations can only be implemented where there is a sound policy framework on
land information management. The land information system generated would be
beneficial to other government ministries and other departments within the ministry of
land. There is therefore need to consider the use of the land information as a corporate
resource.";"Obongo, Awuor M";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2003-10-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/26649";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/26649/Obongo%20Awuor%20M%20_Computerised%20land%20information%20system%20as%20a%20tool%20of%20land%20record%20management.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/26649/Obongo%20Awuor%20M%20_Computerised%20land%20information%20system%20as%20a%20tool%20of%20land%20record%20management.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Land record management;Computerization;Land information system;Kenya";""

"uonbi:11295/44866";"Capacity building for sustainable use of animal genetic resources in developing countries. ILRI-SLU Project progress report for the period 1999-2003";"";"To promote a sustainable and improved use of animal genetic resources in developing countries, ILRI in collaboration with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), and supported by Sida (Sweden), launched a project training the trainers, for national agricultural research systems (NABS) scientists (national university teachers and researchers) in developing countries. The main objectives of the project were to strengthen subject knowledge and skills, and teaching and communication skills of scientists teaching and supervising students in animal breeding and genetics at least up to MSc level. Other objectives were to catalyse curriculum development, stimulate contacts and networking, and to develop computer-based training resources relevant for use by NARS scientists in teaching and research. This capacity building project was an integrated component of the ILRI research agenda on Animal Genetic Resources. It was also an endeavour by ILRI to collaborate with and strengthen NARS institutions and scientists. The project was initially planned to include regions in sub-Saharan Africa, SouthEast Asia and South Asia, resources allowing, Latin America. The activities in each region or sub-region included: planning activities (questionnaire, country visits, planning workshop), training course for university teachers and researchers (three weeks, combining training in animal genetics/breeding and teaching methodologies), development of an Animal Genetics Training Resource' (on CD-ROM, and later also on the Web), follow-up activities, including impact assessment (questionnaires and follow-up workshops). During the period 1999 to 2003 a full round of activities was completed for sub Saharan Africa. The training course was conducted for Eastern/Southern Africa (20 scientists from 10 countries) and for Western/Central Africa (18 scientists from 10 countries). The planning and follow-up workshops were performed jointly for the region. In addition, the planning activities and training course (18 scientists from 9 countries) were completed for South-East Asia. Version 1 of the computer-based training resource (CD) was released in late 2003. The resource contains modules, i.e. core texts on issues related with farm animal genetic resources, quantitative methods and teaching methods, and Resources containing case studies, breed information, maps, examples, exercises, video clips, a glossary and a virtual library. It also contains references to web links, books and other CDs. The participants found the training courses very useful; average score for Overall Impression was 8.2 (scale 1-9). They also indicated that the computer-based training resource would be a valuable tool both in teaching and in research, but had not yet had a chance to explore and use it fully. Impact assessments for Africa (questionnaire and follow-up workshop) showed that the training course has already had a substantial impact in many of the participants. Impact assessments for Africa (questionnaire and follow-up workshop) showed that the training course has already had a substantial impact in many of the participants' home institutions, both on teaching methods and on course content. Students have shown more interest and understanding of animal breeding and genetics. The impact on participants' research has been just as large; more focus on research involving indigenous animal genetic resources, improved research proposal writing, research methodologies and science communication skills, and also more efficient supervision of students' research. Many of the participants have actively disseminated materials and experiences from the course to colleagues in their home institutions. Other important outcomes have been increased contacts and an open e-mail network `Afrib' formed by the African course participants. The project also strengthened Swedish knowledge and expanded PhD activities on animal genetic resources in developing countries; these were valuable `spin-off effects' of the project. The 'training the trainers' approach adopted in the ILRI-SLU project seems to be a good model for effective capacity building to promote a sustainable use of animal genetic resources in developing countries. The approach was innovative and has functioned well; the model could be extended to other disciplines. Furthermore, linking universities from the North to those of the South, with a CGIAR institute playing both a facilitating and catalytic role was beneficial. The project will now proceed to South Asia and version 2 of the computer-based training resource will be developed. More impact analyses will also be performed.";"Mwai, AO

It argues that under all systems of law in many African countries, ownership of land and associated resources is very much anchored in patriarchy. It decries the failure to isolate positive aspects of customary law and the preponderance of women-unfriendly customary law which influences statutory and other forms of law. Part II of the paper provides the conceptual and theoretical premises of the paper. It looks at patriarchy, gender and law and their impact on tenure relations emphasising the male dominance. Part III looks at the issues of access, control and ownership as informing paradigms for exploring the gender-land tenure issue. Part IV looks at women's rights to property under customary law and points to the preponderance of male control and the relegation of women's rights to use. It also underscores the precarious nature of women's rights and the inability of women to access statutory legal provisions on tenure to land even when these are in their favour.

the desire of every organisation to keep abreast with changing times and demands in the
environment, it is accepted that having strategic plans on paper and donor conferences is
very different from the on-ground implementation exercise To identify the challenges of
strategy implementation, a case study of Indigenous Information Network was conducted.
The study aimed to answer two research questions: what were the challenges of strategy
implementation and how the challenges could be overcome and it involved in-depth
interviews with members of staff involved with the implementation of strategy.
Interviews was done with the help of an interview guide and the data obtained from the
study was analysed through a content analysis which was most suited for this kind of
study and qualitative nature of data collected. The results from the study revealed that
implementation variables could be challenges that undermine the implementation
process. These variables were leadership factors, organisational structure, resources
allocation and information systems. It was discovered that these variables can pose
challenges to an organization strategy implementation or enhance success of the strategy
implementation process.
The study recommends that to overcome the challenges related to leadership, structure
resources and information systems there is need for structural adjustments, strengthening
of staff skills, leadership that motivates employees to commit to strategy implementation
and enhancement of information systems at all levels.
Limitations identified in the study are that the challenging factors found were examined
separately based on their relationship to implementation. The study was also done in the

A case of Kajiado County, Kenya";"";"Suitable location and influx of immigrants have made pastoral peri-urban Kajiado County a centre of two conflicting interests; urban sprawl and agricultural intensification.  To understand the resulting trends over the period 1984-2010 satellite image based analysis of land use cover changes and interviews with landowners were conducted. Interviews focused on the changes and trends in land use, their causes and future forecasts. Percentage changes in land use and land cover types for the years 1984 to 2004, 2004 to 2010 and 1984 to 2010 were determined. Between 1984 and 2010, significant (p < 0.05) changes occurred in built-up, crop land, rangelands, bare ground, rocky areas and woodlots and riverine vegetation. Only water bodies showed no significant changes. Land use and cover changes resulted from activities due to human population growth and agricultural expansion which in turn resulted in increase in riverine vegetation and woodlots. The interviews revealed that selling of land contributed to land use change depending on the intended use of the buyers who were mainly influenced by the physical location with respect to distance to Nairobi, urban centres, electricity supply and road networks. As per the findings of the study, the present scenario demands a revision in the zoning policy using the land use land cover maps produced, involvement of all stake holders and revision of implementation strategies given that the 2008 land use master plan for the area was not actualized.";"Morara, Mary K

"uonbi:11295/88452";"Investigating viability of the premium influenced land agro-usage structure for production of African leafy vegetables in Vihiga and Jinja";"";"Land subdivision has reduced land for agricultural production resulting in its intensive cultivation. This has lowered soil fertility which has contributed to reduction in the diversity of African Leafy Vegetables thus restricting the otherwise traditional dietary diversity that was once beneficial to smallholder farmers. As land continues to decline, there needs to be some impetus in place that can retain the diversity of African Leafy Vegetables. This study therefore recognized the need to niche the African Leafy Vegetables to a none-competing, specially constructed raised cropping bed referred to us the Premium Influenced Land Agro-usage structure (PILA). A study to investigate the viability of the PILA structure for production of vegetable crops was undertaken in Vihiga and Jinja. The objective of the study was to evaluate the benefits of the PILA structures. PILA structures were constructed on 20 smallholder farms in Vihiga and Jinja. Vegetable crops Solanum scabrum, Cleome gynandra, Amaranthus hybridus) and exotic vegetables (Daucas carota) were grown on these structures. The same procedure was done on farmers’ conventional plots (Flat beds). Analysis to compare the performance of vegetable crops between the PILA and Flat beds was done using Genstat. The net present value was used to assess the viability of the structure for long term use. Results indicated high significant differences (p≤0.001) in yield and height of vegetables crops grown on PILA and flat beds, (PILA yield (kg/ha) was 42254 versus 27772 for flat beds, PILA height in (cm) was 14.8 versus 10.8 for flat beds). Comparisons in vegetable performance between seasons showed better performance of vegetable crops in the Long Rains than the Short Rains seasons for both sites with significant difference (p=0.001) in yield (kg/ha) for the Long Rain (LR) was 36064 against 33962 for the Short Rain (SR), mean height (cm) for LR was 13 against 12.5 for SR, mean branching (score out of 3) for LR was 2.5 against 2.4 for SR. Also significant differences in vegetable performance were detected between Vihiga and Jinja in height and yield; mean yield (kg/ha) for Vihiga was 34962 and 36064 for Jinja, mean height (cm) for Vihiga was 12.8 and 16.6 for Jinja. The PILAs had a high net present value (KSH191390) compared to flats beds (KSH122087). Vegetable crops on PILA structure performed better than on Flat beds, the PILA structure can be promoted for production of vegetables in areas with small land sizes like the urban and peri-urban.

Amboseli Ecosystem, one of Kenya’s rangelands has been experiencing changes in its economic activi-ties. Traditionally pastoralism and wildlife conservation has been the key source of livelihood for people in the ecosystem. Crop production is a more recent economic activity being inte-grated in the ecosystem. These changes are attributable to the macro and micro economic, social and demographic factors. Therefore, the question of the economic benefits to the land owners for engaging in different land uses arises. This creates the need to do an economic evaluation of the land- use options and their drivers within the ecosystem. The major land –use options identified included livestock keeping, crop production and wildlife conservation. The study used gross margin analysis to determine the value of these competing land use op-tions. This was coupled with multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine the drivers of these competing lands -use options. The study used both primary and secondary data. Pri-mary data was obtained at the household level using semi-structured questionnaires, focused group discussions and key informant interviews and secondary data from the District Agricul-tural Office, Loitoktok. Primary data was collected in 2014 from a sample size of 295 house-holds using probability proportional to size sampling in a systematic random procedure. Data was entered; cleaned and analyzed using statistical packages; SPSS, STATA and Ms Excel.
Different socio-economic (age, annual net income and education), microeconomic (distance to nearest market centre, access to credit) and land characteristics (distance to the main source of water, land tenure and land size) influenced the decision on the choice of land- use. The results showed that all the three economic activities have significant contribution to the household’s welfare. In the case of the crops and livestock production, the choice of the eco-
nomic activity to practice and its intensity is entirely dependent on the decision by the house-hold. This is unlike wildlife conservation that has some influence from the government through KWS.
Livestock keeping is seen to be a more stable source of income for the households compared to wildlife conservation. This is because for every unit increase in the annual income of the household, livestock keeping is preferred to wildlife conservation. Similarly, the gross margin analysis results showed a higher net income from livestock per household compared to wild-life conservation. The government should therefore put in place mechanisms that encourage wildlife conservation and would lead to more direct benefits from wildlife. These are such as prompt compensation for farmers after loss of their animals or injuries caused by wildlife or direct payments to farmers who lease their lands for wildlife conservation.";"Njuguna, Evelyne, W";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2017-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/102092";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102092/Njuguna_Economic%20Evaluation%20of%20Competing%20Land-%20Use%20Options%20and%20Their%20Drivers%20in%20Amboseli%20Ecosystem%2c%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/102092/Njuguna_Economic%20Evaluation%20of%20Competing%20Land-%20Use%20Options%20and%20Their%20Drivers%20in%20Amboseli%20Ecosystem%2c%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Economic Evaluation of Competing Land- Use Options and Their Drivers in Amboseli Ecosystem, Kenya";""

It was anticipated by the business community, leading to the change of use of land along it, manifested in the development of malls and housing estates. This land use change is continuing despite the road having been completed in February of the year 2012. The road was built with the aim of easing the traffic congestion problem, but traffic congestion persists. This phenomenon has not been documented in this part of the world and the study aims at doing so.
A study area was isolated along the Thika Superhighway which had a variety of land uses. An examination was done on the nature of the superhighway itself, the predominant land use in this area, the nature of the land use changes and the effect of this on traffic along the highway. This was done with a view to establishing a link between adjacent land use changes and traffic along the superhighway.
Results from the study indicate that there is a relationship between adjacent land use change and traffic on the highway. This was evidenced from changes in the design of the highway at some friction points where land use change had occurred and had had an impact on the traffic flow. As well, the desire for most of the respondents to own private vehicles would tend to have the effect of increasing traffic along the highway from a planning point of view.
The conclusions drawn from the study therefore point to a need to have a reliable transport system to bring down the numbers of private vehicles on the roads thus congestion. As well, it is incumbent upon transport and planning authorities to come up with means of performing conclusive studies on the impact of certain developments to roadways and thus mitigate these impacts early on in development.";"Lugalia, Dennis S";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2018-12-31";"en";"assessment;land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/107418";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/107418/Lugalia_Assessment%20Of%20The%20Relationship%20Between%20Land%20Use%20And%20Traffic%20Along%20The%20Thika%20Superhighway%2c%20Nairobi%2c%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Land Use And Traffic Along The Thika Superhighway";""

sustained by a combination of factors. However, reviews indicate that these factors cannot be generalized, as they
tend to be case specific. A study was therefore conducted to explore the history and reasons for enclosure establishment
in Chepareria, a formerly degraded communal rangeland in north-western Kenya. While Vi-Agroforestry Organization
accounting for 52.5 % was the main source of knowledge on enclosure establishment; it has now emerged
that rangeland enclosures among the Pokot pastoral community existed prior to land management interventions by
Vi- Agroforestry. Results indicated that there are three categories of enclosures which were established for boundary
demarcation, provide grazing reserves, enable proper land management, facilitate crop cultivation in a pastoral setup
and to curb land degradation. The role of self-trigger [accounting for most of the spontaneous enclosures (73.5 %)]
indicates the continued establishment and expansion of areas under enclosure management as private land ownership
accounting for 51.7 % of enclosure tenure continues to gain momentum in Chepareria. While rangeland enclosures
in Chepareria were mainly established for boundary demarcation, to alleviate pasture scarcity and enable proper
management of formerly degraded areas; they have facilitated land restoration and rehabilitation by increasing flexibility
in land, fodder and livestock management amongst agro-pastoralists in Chepareria over the last three decades.
To ensure that rehabilitated areas do not revert to their previously degraded state; technical interventions are needed
to allow for a more intensive use of rangeland resources within enclosed areas";"Wairore, John N

"uonbi:11295/28721";"The impact on Nairobi national park of changes in land use in adjacent areas";"";"The future of wildlife in our conserved
ecosystem depends largely on the future planning for
land use in the adjacent areas. All National Parks
and game reserves in Kenya, as they now exist, are in
some degree or other dependent on the relationship
between land use changes and wildlife in the areas
sorrounding them. If the surrounding lands deteriorate
through misuse, or if, in the management no consideration
is given to wildlife, the national parks and game
reserves will suffer, or,even be destroyed. Nairobi
National Park pr~sents a-case in point. If this park
has to survive, as it is, there must be a check of the
land use changes in the Kitengela and Ngong hills are_as.
There were three (3) specific objectives of this
study. Firstly, to identify and, analyse the changes
in land use which have been/or are taking place in
the adjacent areas of Nairobi National Park since its
establishment in 1946; secondly, to find out their main
,
impacts on the park and its immediate environment.
Finally, to suggest an optimum land use system for
the area that takes into account the ecological,

From the study it was observed that Nairobi
National Park, Kitengela area and Ngong hills form
land use in the adjacent areas of Nairobi National
Park have been taking place over along time but the
pace has increased particularly, since independence.
Six significant areas of land use changes, namely,
changes in land tenure, livestock production, crop
pro,uuct~on, urban settlement, rural settlement, ,
physical infrastructure, conservation and others were
identified. It was found further that these changes
in land use exercise impacts on the Park and its
immediate environment. Specific impacts were realized
on wildlife, vegetation and water resources. It was
observed that a number of constraints and limitations,
namely, high population growth rate, land tenure
system, change in attitudes, rapid urban development,
national government policies, departmenta~lization
of the government bodies, lack of technical manpower,
lack of equipments and lack of funds exist and may
hinder future development in the area.
The study proposes an integrated land use policy
upon which Nairobi National Park, Athi Kaputei plains
and Ngong hills can be planne~and managed as one
ecosystem. Its aim is to identify areas of concentration
for the different land use activities and interests and
plan these as areas of land use specialization but
maintaining a clear functional linkage between them so
that, at the same time they are together capable of
fun~tioning as an interrelated whole system. The study
further suggests that a detailed study regarding the
possibility of planning and managing Nairobi National
Pa.rk as an ""outdoor zoo"", be undertaken by the wildlife
planning unit in consultation with relevant experts
as may be identified by the unit. Its aim should be to
establish in more clear terms the feasibility or ,,
otherwise of such a policy, and the advantages and
disadvantages associated to it. As policy priorities,
it is suggested that in order to create a strong public
participation, the government should establish measures
to provide the landowners who permit wildlife the use
of their land resources with an economic incentive
from wildlife conservation. Finally, we propose a need
to constantly monitor the changes in land use and human
population in the study area so that any trend
representing a hazard to wildlife is observed and
appropriate counteraction initiated in time.
However, it is considered that the implementation
of an integrated land use policy would ensure the
continued viability of Nairobi National Park and other
ecosystems in the country.";"Omondi, Paul";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"1984-12-31";"en";"area;land use";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/28721";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/28721/Omondi%20Paul%20B.%20A_The%20Impact%20on%20Nairobi%20National%20Park%20of%20Changes%20in%20Land%20Use%20in%20Adjacent%20Areas..pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/28721/Omondi%20Paul%20B.%20A_The%20Impact%20on%20Nairobi%20National%20Park%20of%20Changes%20in%20Land%20Use%20in%20Adjacent%20Areas..pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"The impact on Nairobi national park;changes in land use";""
"uonbi:11295/15964";"Agricultural Land Management for Sustainable Development in Rural Kenya";"";"Land is one of the most important naturaE resources for the creation of wealth in many societies. Its ownership and control brings economic power, which in turn, is often the basis for social and polifical power Unlike other factors of production such as labour and capilal, land is in fixed supply. Of the total land area of Kenya of 56.9 million hectares, more than 90 percent is agricultural land. Over 80 percent of this land is categorized as Arid and Semiarid land where about 25 percent of the total population resides and over 50 percent of the total livestock is produced. Only 17percent of the total arable land is considered to be of medium to high potential areas. This is where about 75 percent ofthe total population is found as well as the remaining forests. About 80 percent of the total population lives in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. The objective of the paper is /0 review the existing policies, laws and regulations that guide the use and management of agricultural land clearly examining their effectiveness in enhancing sustainable rural development Through a desk review of the multiple policies, laws and regulations that govern the utilization and management of agricultural land in Kenya, various problems were identified. The individuafization of/enure through land registration has led to the subdivision of agricultural land to uneconomic units that are unsuitabie for agricultural activities especially in pastoral areas. There is an absence of comprehensive and clear policies and laws on how to gail1 access to land for agricultural uses by the landless, who are mainly squatters on huge tracks of land owned by absentee landlords. This has led to conflicts and the degradation of agricultural land due to lack of effective integrated environmental management. The fragmented land management system has resulted into uncoordinated actions by the many actors. However, land registration resulting /0 the conversion of land into a commodity has enabled farmers' access credit all the security of registered tit/e. This credit has led to improvement of land and soil ccnservetion through the development of agm-forestry and other soil and water conservation measures. For agricultural land to continue playing the key roles of food production for the country's ever-increasing population, creating employment and contributing to the foreign exchange earning there is need to urgently implement the new land policy, review and consolidate the existing multiple policies, laws and regulations in order to enhance good management and use of agricultural land. Land carrying capacity determination must precede any subdivision of agricultural land activity. There is need to harmonize and coordinate the institutions and agencies that deaf with agricultural land use management with an aim of improving the management and control of agricultural lands. A cteer law that stipulates how to deal with absentee landlordism and neglected land must be put in place if soil erosion and degradation of such land is to be avoided";"Kimani, Mary";"";"";"University of Nairobi";"2008-12-31";"en";"agricultural land management;development;land management;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/15964";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/15964/Fulltext.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/15964/Fulltext.pdf.jpg?sequence=6&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"agricultural land;;agricultural policies;laws and regulations;;sustainable agricultural land development.";""

The land use types of study area are six, of which three are the main and the other three are the minor. The main three, forest, shrub or bush land and grassland, changed during the period, of which grasslands reduced by 5864 ha (40%), forest by 3071 ha (24%) and shrub and bush land increased by 8912 ha (43%). The other three minor land use types were bare land which had reduced by 238 ha (45%), river bed vegetation increased by 209 ha (72%) and agriculture increased by 52 ha (600%) over the period decades. Differences in spatiotemporal variations of vegetation could be largely attributed to the effects of climate factors, anthropogenic activities and their interactions. Precipitation and temperature have been demonstrated to be the key climate factors for plant growth and vegetation development where rainfall decreased by 200 mm and temperatures increased by 1.5 °C over the period. Also, the opinion of the community on the change of land use and management was attributed to climate change and also adaptation strategies applied by the community over time. For example unlike the common understanding that forest resources utilisation increases with increasing human population, Mukogodo dry forested ecosystem case is different in that the majority of the respondents (78.9%) reported that the forest resource use was more in that period than now and also a similar majority (74.2%) had the same opinion that forest resource utilisation was low compared to last 30 years. In Yaaku community, change impacts were evidenced and thus mitigation measures suggested to address the impacts which included the following: controlled bush management and indigenous grass reseeding programme were advocated to restore original grasslands, and agricultural (crop farming) activities are carried out in designated areas outside the forest conservation areas (ecosystem zoning) all in consultation with government (political class), community and other stakeholders. Groups are organised (environmental management committee) to address conservation, political and vulnerability issues in the pastoral dry forested ecosystem which will sustain pastoralism in the ecosystem.";"M'mboroki, KG

"uonbi:11295/22168";"Electronic Land Registry for Kenya";"";"Land in most Kenyan societies is the most important of the natural resources, representing
the foundation of much of the country's economic activity. For most individual Kenyans,
the purchase of a parcel of land represents the largest financial and legal transaction of their
lifetime. Hence the buying, selling, and refinancing of land is a significant component of the
Kenyan economy. Therefore the. ability to firmly and quickly establish ownership and to
allow secure and effective transfers is essential to the economic competitiveness of Kenya in
the modern world. The ever-increasing growth in population has led to the ownership of
land changing hands frequently. This has led to an increase in the number of transactions
carried out daily in the land registries, and corroborated with the independent decentralized
land registries units, makes the present manual registration system slow, cumbersome, costly
to run, manage and maintain.
The idea was conceptualized after a study of land registration in England, Wales and the
province of Ontario, who have successfully managed to fully implement Electronic Land
Registration. From this study, ways in which Kenyan land registration system could be
improved.
The current land law recognizes paper based transactions only. For Electronic registration
system to be actualized, reference was made to the land laws of Kenya, consultation with
land law experts was also done so as to formulate a suitable legal framework. Electronic
land registration system for Kenya, has been designed with the end user in mind, the system
supports the current workflow of documents from one office to the next in a typical land
registry. The language used on the interface is simplified and the system generated messages
uses jargon that the end users are used to. This makes it easier for them to adapt to the new
system and also reduces training time.";"Ngeno, Collins C";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2010-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/22168";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/22168/Ngeno%20-Electronic%20Land%20Registry%20For%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/22168/Ngeno%20-Electronic%20Land%20Registry%20For%20Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Electronic Land Registry";""

Well-structured foreign land leases and investments might offer development benefits to the host countries including opportunities for employment, provision of capital for improvement of infrastructure and stabilization of food prices. However, most foreign land lease deals in Africa are often characterized by secret negotiations and lack of local stakeholder consultations. Consequently, the land deals often result in displacement of land owners and loss of their customary land rights such as grazing and fuel wood access rights. The situation is exacerbated by relatively low monetary compensation offered to the land owners by the foreign investors. In recent years, numerous protests by the excluded stakeholders have resulted to considerable loss of investments and disruption of livelihoods. Against this backdrop, the present study analyzed local community members' preferences for foreign land lease design attributes in coastal Kenya using choice experiment survey data from a random sample of 200 respondents. Results showed that respondents prefer varying payment levels in order to allow design of leases that incorporate the following attributes: short lease duration (up to 15 years); renewable leases after joint negotiations and; provision of formal employment to land owners' household members. These insights should be incorporated in the design of foreign land leases to promote harmony between land owners and leasers.";"Otieno, DJ

The results show that the maximum and minimum temperatures have been increasing, with warmer temperatures being experienced mostly at night time. The average change in the mean maximum and minimum seasonal surface air temperature for the region were 0.74°C and 0.60°C, respectively between the 1961-1990 and 1991-2013 periods. Decreasing but statistically insignificant trends in the seasonal rainfall were noted in the area, but with mixed patterns in variability. The March-April-May rainfall season indicated the highest decrease in the seasonal rainfall amounts. The southern parts of the region had a decreasing trend in rainfall that was greater than that of the northern areas. The results of this study are expected to support sustainable pastoralism system prevalent with the local communities in the ASALs.

"uonbi:11295/14991";"The Impacts of organisational culture in the performance of land administration institutions";"";"Land as a resource and factor of production plays a major role in the development of a country. The management and administration of land is
done through structures and processes that are governed by the existing institutional and regulatory frameworks. In most of the countries, these
processes are undertaken by public service institutions (central and local government), which are not only the custodians of public land but of
records and information pertaining to land rights. With the world becoming a global village, it has become apparent that the performance of
public institutions should be benchmarked against other best practices. Land administration is no different, and where in the past, stakeholders
have been dogged by inefficiency, corruption and poor record keeping, now the stakeholders demand accountability, probity and good governance
of land administration systems with clear time frames and measurable outputs of the processes. This paper is a result of a study that aimed at examining
the management systems of land administration in Kenya. It attempts to show that the performance of any institution is highly
dependent on the organizational culture and work attitudes of the employees of the organization. The study found that most of the consumers
rated the land administration institutions in Kenya as poor with most linking this, to poor work attitudes and culture. The paper recommends the
need for land administration institutions to embrace attitudinal change and respond positively to the changing management trends for better
performance.";"Mwangi, Winnie N.";"";"";"University of Nairobi";"2009-12-31";"en";"land administration";"";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/14991";"";"";"";"";"";"Land administration,;Organisational culture,;Change management";""

"uonbi:11295/16392";"The road network in the Mombasa municipal area: A spatial analysis of its effects on land values, population density and travel patterns";"";"Few studies exist that show the relationship between urban transportation and urban structure in the developing world. As the developing countries become rapidly urbanized, there is growing need for adequate planning for a balanced urban development. Urban planners should pay attention to urban transportation for it provides access to urban areas and helps to reduce intra-urban inequality.

The present study examines the relationship between urban transport and urban structure at a micro-scale that is on urban area in Kenya. The study covers the Mombasa municipal area. The study investigates the relationship between time-distance and land values, population density and travel patterns or the number of personal trips.

In many applications, the linear distance has given way to the more revealing features of time-distance. Travel time is always more relevant in the developing countries than physical or road distances. Transport improvements in the developing countries often proceed rapidly with a correspondingly rapid impact on the structure of the space economy.

This study raises and examines three questions. They are:
1.	What is the structure of land values, population density and personal trips within the Mombasa Municipal area?
2.	To what extent does the transportation pattern influence the structure of land values, population density and personal trips within the Mombasa Municipal area?
3.	Is the structure observed similar or different from that in industrialized cities?

Mombasa is both a pre-industrial as well as a colonial city. Therefore it offers an appropriate testing ground for the theories and findings on the urban transportation expansion and its relationship to urban structure. This study attempts to achieve three objectives:-

a)	Establishing the relationship between time-distance and land values.
b)	Establishing the relationship between time-distance and population density.
c)	Establishing the relationship between time-distance and the number of personal trips to the city centre.

Three hypotheses are advanced and their validities tested. They are:

a)	Land values decline with increasing travel time from the city centre. An inverse relationship exists between time-distance and land values.
b)	Population density declines with increasing travel time from the city centre. An inverse relationship exists between travel time and population density.
c)	The number of personal trips decreases with increasing travel time from the city centre. An inverse relationship exists between time-distance and the number of personal trips to the city centre.

The hypotheses are tested by means of; the description and explanation of the structure of land values, population density and trips, bivariate regression on land values, density and trips as well as the mapping of regression residuals. 

Time-distance is measured from Mwembe Tayarl on the Mombasa Island using Municipal Bus time. A partial correlation analysis is used to measure the relationship between bus time and the three dependent variables holding matatu time constant.

The study is limited to a time-distance analysis for bus and Matatu travel time. It excludes other transport modes such as air, rail and sea transport. These areas can be explored in future research. The study comprises seven Chapters. The first Chapter is the Introduction which explains the problem to be investigated and includes a Literature Review.

The Second Chapter deals with research Methodology and describes the techniques used to test the hypotheses and their limitations.

Chapter 3 deals with the spatial structure of the road network in Mombasa. This examines the main road network including bridges, causeways and ferries. It also examines the main forms of public transport, that is the bus and matatu systems.
Chapter 4, 5 and 6 deal with the structure and the factors influencing land values, population density an travel patterns in Mombasa respectively. Chapter 7 is the summary and concluding chapter. Here the main research findings are mentioned, recommendations and conclusions are also made. The main findings of this study are:

Land values, population density and the number of home-based trips decline, with time-distance from the city centre and are relatively higher on the Mombasa Island than on the mainland. This is mainly because of the good road network on the Island providing a high degree of accessibility. The Kenya Bus Travel time has a generally higher person correlation coefficient with land values, population density and trips than the matatu time.

The land value theory, population density functions and travel patterns developed in the Western countries apply to Mombasa to some extent. But, this does not mean that urban transportation and urban structure in the developing world should be modeled after the Western city without modifications.

collected. Socio-economic data was collected from the local Turkana population and the settlement camp. The data was analysed
using SPSS computer package and descriptive statistics. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) in vegetation cover and

Each was sampled for macrofauna using three sampling methods (monolith,
transect and pitfall trapping). Seventy eight (78) genera/species were recorded across the different land use systems of Taita. Rényi diversity profile indicated no significant differences in species richness across land use systems as reflected by the very close
diversity profiles at α = 0. However, the two diversity indices (Shannon index: α = 1 and Simpson’s index: α
= 2) indicated that plantation forest was the most diverse of the land use systems, while fallow and maize were least diverse. Rényi evenness profile indicated that the plantation forest was most even in terms of species distribution which was least in maize.
However because some of the profiles for some land use systems cross each other, they could not be ranked. The major macrofauna groups recorded in the Taita benchmark site included: Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Coleoptera, Oligochaeta and Orthoptera and Arenae.
Generally Hymenoptera were the most abundant of the macrofauna groups constituting about 36% of the total followed by Isoptera (22%), Oligochaeta (16%), Coleoptera (10%). The other macrofauna (Arenae, Diplopoda, Diptera, Orthoptera, Blattidae, Isopoda,
Chilopoda- Geopholomorpha, Hemiptera, Opiliones,Chiopoda-Scolopendromorpha, Lepidoptera, Dermaptera, Phasmidae, Blattelidae and Mantodea each constituted <10% of the total macrofauna recorded. Hymenoptera was ranked 1st as it had the highest total abundance (59,440 individuals m-2), while Mantodea was ranked 18th and had the lowest total abundance (6 individuals m-2). Generally macrofauna density was higher in arable systems than forests, although the differences were not always significant. Except for Chilopoda-Geopholomorpha, Chilopoda-
Scolopendromorpha and Isopoda, all the other macroafauna groups were not significantly different across land use systems. The three groups (Chilopoda- Geopholomorpha, Chilopoda- Scolopendromorpha and Isopoda) were significantly highest in the forests than
in all the other land use systems. These variation appear to be associated with management practices that consequently results in the destruction of nesting habitats, modification of soil microclimate within these habitats and removal of substrate, low diversity and availability of food sources for the associated macrofauna groups. The significant correlations between some soil macrofauna groups with selected soil chemical properties too show that, soil chemical characteristics may indirectly play a role in influencing the density, distribution and structure of macrofauna communities. This indicates the potential of using these fauna groups as bio-indicators of soil productivity.

International attention has become focused upon the development of alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture to alleviate poverty, protect biodiversity and reduce climate change. Before alternative land use systems can be evaluated in terms of carbon sequestration, baseline measurements of carbon dynamics resulting from current practices are required. We have characterized the carbon stocks in six slash-and-burn chronosequences in the humid forest zone of Cameroon. Each chronosequence consisted of original forest, two year-old cropland, a cacao plantation, bush fallow, tree fallow and secondary forest. Four, nine and seventeen years, respectively, had passed since the original forest was cleared for the latter three land uses. At each of 36 site × land use combinations, tree, understorey, litter, root and soil (0–50 cm) carbon were measured in five 100 m2 quadrates. The original forest contained 308 t C ha−1 and lost 220 t C ha−1 upon conversion to agriculture. The most vulnerable carbon pool was the above ground tree biomass and the most stable was soil organic matter. Carbon reaccumulated in the recovering fallows at a rate of 9.4 t C ha−1 yr−1 (r = 0.83). When these results were extrapolated using a geographic information system, deforestation rates in Southern Cameroon were estimated to be 1,355 km−2 yr−1 between 1973 and 1988 resulting in annual forest system carbon losses of 13.5 million t C. During the course of this study, three alternatives to slash-and-burn were identified: commercial cassava cultivation, improved forest conversion, and stratified agroforestry. These alternative land uses have the potential to reduce C losses over current practices by 10, 55 and 75 t C ha−1, respectively, and also differ greatly in their potential to alleviate rural poverty, protect biodiversity and deflect additional deforestation.";"Kotto-Same, Jean

"uonbi:11295/12276";"Distribution and diversity of pythium spp. in indigenous forests and adjacent farm lands in Taita and Embu districts in Kenya";"";"Pythium is a water mould fungus which survive as a parasite, saprophyte or both. Pythium
spp. play important ecological services like recycling of both Carbon and mineral
nutrients for continued plant growth. Members of this genus are ubiquitous and found in
soil, water, plants and animal substrate. Spatial distribution and species diversity of
Pythium were studied with aim of determining the effects of intensive agricultural
practices on distribution and diversity. Agricultural intensification interferes with the
natural processes occurring within the soil and destroys useful bacteria and fungi, and
other organisms leading to increase in parasitic species like Pythium. Application of
agrochemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides as well as continuous cropping
interferes with natural processes in the soil ecosystem leading to change in the number of
Pythium species in the soil (Burge, 1988). The possibility of using Pythium as
environmental quality indicator is considered as one important aspect of the study since
their distribution is associated with a particular environmental condition, that the presence
or absence of such condition means its presence or absence (Paoletti et al.,1991).
Land use practices in the two benchmark sites form a gradient of land use intensities
drawn from the inputs which is perfect for testing the significance on the difference in
distribution and diversity.
Each benchmark site was divided into windows, sampling plots and sampling points
where soil samples were collected. Using the soil samples collected from Embu in lrangi
forest and Taita in Ngangao forest, the presence of Pythium species propagules were
tested by attempting to isolate species of the genera using baiting techniques. The
growing mycelium were verified directly by water mounts in a Microscope or transferred
from the bait to the isolation media CMA (Com Meal Agar) amended with antibiotic
Chloramphenicol (20mg/L) and Benomyl (10mg/L). To get data on distribution of
Pythium at each sampling point, soil was collected at different depths. The isolates were
characterized using morphological features in order to identify them tospecies level as
guided by 'Monograph of genus Pythium' (Van Der Plaats - Niterink 1983).
Eighteen Pythium species were collected in Embu and ten species in Taita. This shows
that Embu has a richer diversity than Taita. Over 20 morpho species whose identification
was not certain were isolated also in both Embu and Taita. ANa VA analysis of deviance
table shows that dispersion of Pythium in Taita based on land use system is significant at
p~0.04927 at a=O.05. Also, it was found that Chances of encountering Pythium increases
significantly ith increase in carbon in Embu (p ~0.01830) (fig.7), and nitrogen
concentration (~0.0003518).";"Mukundi, David N";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2011-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/12276";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/12276/Mukundi%2c%20David%20N_%20Distribution%20and%20diversity%20of%20in%20pythium%20spp%20indigenous%20forests%20and%20adjacent%20farm%20iands%20in%20taita%20and%20embu%20districts%20in%20kenya.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/12276/Mukundi%2c%20David%20N_%20Distribution%20and%20diversity%20of%20in%20pythium%20spp%20indigenous%20forests%20and%20adjacent%20farm%20iands%20in%20taita%20and%20embu%20districts%20in%20kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Distribution;diversity;pythium spp.;indigenous forests;farm lands;Taita district;Embu district;Kenya";""

year old), randomly purchased from three herds/flocks in study area, were sacrificed for whole liver and 12th
right and left ribs. Homogenized liver samples pooled from all the lobes and defatted bone ash from whole
left and right 12th ribs were used for determination of Ca, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn status. Liver mineral
analysis, showed that in sheep Cu (303 vs. 184 mg/kg DM), Zn (94.1 vs. 83 mg/kg DM) and Mn (13.2 vs. 7.5
mg/kg DM) were higher (p<0.05) in wet than dry season. In goats, season had no effect on Cu (274.28 vs.

and Mn (13.6 vs. 6.8 mg/kg DM). Sheep grazing in different pastures showed variation (p<0.05) in hepatic Zn,
Cu and Mn contents, while goat varied (p<0.05) in hepatic Cu, Fe and Mn concentrations. Rib analysis
indicated that season had significant effect (p<0.05) on sheep and goats DFF% ash. The rib Ca (359 vs. 362
mg/g), P (157 vs. 147 mg/g) and Mg (9.56 vs. 8.54 mg/g) contents of sheep was not influenced by season
and grazing area (p<0.05), whereas goats rib Ca (360 vs. 326 mg/g), P (142 vs. 165 mg/g) content was
affected by season and grazing area (p<0.05), but Mg showed no seasonal variation. In the wet season, liver
and bone tissue of sheep and goats indicated adequate body status of Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn. However,
in the dry season, sheep showed deficient levels of Zn, goats in Cu, while both species suffered from low
liver Mn and rib Zn reserves. With the exception of P which was marginal in all seasons, mineral deficiencies
affected animals mostly in the dry season. The liver and rib bone of sheep and goats has demonstrated
seasonal fluctuation in tissue mineral reserve. Evaluation of specific minerals in different periods and body
pools can be useful in the diagnosis of mineral status of animals. It can be concluded that, sheep and goats
would benefit from P, Cu, Zn and Mn supplementation, particularly in the dry season.";"Lengarite, M.I.

"uonbi:11295/15566";"Breathing Life into Dead Theories about Property Rights: de Soto and Land Relations in Rural Africa";"";"Presumption of a direct causal link between formalisation of property rights
and economic productivity is back on the international development agenda.
Belief in such a direct causal relationship had been abandoned in the early
1990s, following four decades of land tenure reform experiments that failed to
produce the anticipated efficiency results. The work of Hernando de Soto has
provided the springboard for this revival. De Soto argues that formal property
rights hold the key to poverty reduction by unlocking the capital potential of
assets held informally by poor people.
De Soto’s justifications of formal title do not differ much from justifications that
were advanced for ambitious land tenure reforms in various sub-Saharan African
countries, starting with Kenya in the 1950s. Introduction of formal title in the
African areas was seen as the key to solving problems of land degradation and
improving agriculture by providing farmers with security of tenure that would
create incentives for further investment in the land.
This paper argues that there are five shortcomings in both the old and contemporary
arguments for formalisation of land title. First, legality is constructed
narrowly to mean only formal legality. Therefore legal pluralism is equated with
extra-legality. Second, there is an underlying social evolutionist bias that presumes
inevitability of the transition to private (conflated with individual) ownership
as the destiny of all societies. Third, the presumed link between formal title
and access to credit facilities has not been borne out by empirical evidence.
Fourth, markets in land are understood narrowly to refer only to ’formal
markets’. Fifth, the arguments in favour of formulisation of title as the means
to secure tenure ignore the fact that formal title could also generate insecurity.";"Nyamu-Musembi, Celestine";"";"Institute of Development Studies";"University of Nairobi";"2006-12-31";"en";"agriculture;land tenure;property;property rights";"";"002";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/15566";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/15566/cmusembi.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=n";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/15566/cmusembi.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=n";"";"";"";"Property rights;Land relations;Agriculture;Poverty reduction;Land tenure;Africa";""

"uonbi:11295/72157";"Putting a Spin on Jatropha:";"How conservationist Rhetoric Drove Bedford Biofuels out of Tana Delta - Kenya";"When the Canadian company Bedford Biofuels (BB) started talks with local ranch owners in Tana Delta district (Kenya) about subleasing their land for a large jatropha plantation, they were not the first ones to come to the region for a large-scale agricultural project. Nor were they the first to explore the possibilities of starting a jatropha plantation in Kenya’s coastal area. By the time BB arrived, nature conservation and humanitarian NGOs had firmly established themselves as protectors of the ecologically fragile Tana river delta (now Ramsar site) and its residents, who were argued to be (even more) marginalized by large-scale agricultural projects. During the decision-making process, therefore, BB encountered stiff resistance from local NGOs, which had acquired the experience and the mechanisms to oppose or discourage a large-scale plantation. Additionally, BB was faced with a central government which gradually moved from a pro-jatropha stance to a more critical view of large-scale jatropha cultivation. Nevertheless, most of the local residents as well as the local government administration and the county council supported BB’s plans to establish a large jatropha plantation. Although the deal was struck and the anti-jatropha campaign had ostensibly not prevailed, BB closed its plantation within the year. In the article, we analyze how discursive generalizations about foreign large-scale land acquisitions and in particular about large foreign jatropha plantations gradually undermined the legitimacy of the BB jatropha plantation in Tana Delta. To explore this question, the discussion focuses on analyzing the resources that account for the success of the anti-BB rhetoric and the interests that were involved in its production. These resources have been identified as local to global (I)NGO alliances; the use of e-media as a conduit for opposition rhetoric and the strategic use of rhetorical images and polemic. Each of the three phenomena will be explored for their conceptual dimensions and their rhetorical implications. We argue that the conservationist rhetoric compressed intermediality, the grid where ideologies and practices of different stakeholders intersect. Thus, it effectively narrowed the possibility for non-compatible stakeholders, such as Bedford Biofuels, to avoid conflict. This initiated a gradual erosion of the rationale of the BB jatropha project in Tana Delta, which eventually led to the closure of the jatropha project and the departure of Bedford Biofuels from the area.";"Krijtenburg, Froukje

Strategy implementation is also defined as the manner in which an organization should develop, utilize, and amalgamate organizational structure, control systems, and culture to follow strategies that lead to competitive advantage and a better performance. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the challenges of strategy implementation in the ministry of Northern Kenya and other arid areas. The study was a case study since the unit of analysis was one organization which was the Ministry of Northern Kenya. The interviewees were the top managers and functional heads in charge of finance, risk management, information technology and operations, human resources, marketing and research division, and public affairs and communication division. The primary data was collected using an interview guide. The data obtained from the interview guide was analyzed using content analysis. A few of the Quantitive data was analyzed using (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) SPSS. The study concludes that that factors that influence strategy implementation in Ministry of Northern Kenya were financial capacity of the organization, top management support, involvement of board of directors and the employees in the strategic implementation process, organization structure, communication process and also staff motivation and capability of the human resource in the organization in managing and implementing new strategic direction.

The study therefore recommends that for an efficient and effective implementation process senior management must at all levels be involved and committed throughout the process, departmental employees with should be provided with a sound understanding of the forthcoming changes and of the new way of understanding, preparation must be done as much as possible before embarking on full implementation; and also the organization must ensure that there are sufficient resources for the transition and that the top manager and the board of directors are empowered to make the necessary decisions.

"uonbi:11295/21056";"The socio-economic implications of land registration in Tongaren division, Bungoma district";"";"This study examined the socio-economic consequences of land registration In
Tongaren Division, Bungoma District. It was designed to assess how land registration has
impacted on food security, income, gender parity in the ownership of land and, on
kinship ties and social relations. The study was hinged on the premise that land tenure
reform program in Tongaren division has not lived up to its promises. It was justified to
carry out this study on the grounds that land is the matrix of life of many people in this
division; about 80%'of whom depend on it directly for a livelihood. Therefore, any policy
that affects land tenure represents fundamental changes for a considerable portion of the
population in this area. In addition, land issues have become very sensitive political
matters. making it prudent to have an objective examination of the land tenure reform
program and gauge its results in almost over four decades since its inception.
By means of random survey, key informants. observation and life histories. both
qualitative and quantitative data were collected. These were then subjected to descriptive
analysis using such analytical techniques as simple frequencies. percentages. means, and
modes.
To help in explaining the performance of land registration. the theory of political
economy was applied. The theory informed this study's contention that although land
tenure in the whole of Kenya was couched in economic rhetoric, it was inherently
political. The reform has not affected all people equally because of the skewed power
relations which has shaped and legitimized economic relations. It is because of these
skewed power relations that some people have managed to have access to more
productive resources such as land. capital and labour at the expense of others. They are
also the privileged few who enjoy food security and high incomes. Similarly, it is
generally because of the skewed gender power relations that land ownership in Tongaren
Division has tended to be the preserve of men.
Generally. the results showed that land registration has failed to bolster food
security and income levels in Tongaren Division. It has. also. led to a decline in the
otherwise close-knit kinship ties and social relations. as well as exacerbating the problem
of gender disparity in the ownership of land. This study, therefore, recommended that since capital is vital for agricultural
development in Tongaren Division, credit should be made available to farmers under
conditions that are not deterrent. This is to say that a title deed should be a sufficient
condition since it is the only form of security that most farmers in this division have. In
addition, the government should consider waiving the S. F. T loan arrears and ensure that
all farmers are granted tittle deeds. It was further recommended that measures should be
put in place to ensure a smooth operation of the land market to curb illegal dealings in
land. Finally, joint ownership of land between a man and his wife should be made as a
policy to assure women of security of tenure.";"Natembeya, George";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"1999-12-31";"en";"food security;land registration";"Land & Food Security";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/21056";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/21056/NATEMBEYA_GEORGE_M.A_ANTHR._1999.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/21056/NATEMBEYA_GEORGE_M.A_ANTHR._1999.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y";"";"";"";"Socio-economic factors;Land registration;Food security;Gender parity;Income;Ownership";""

sustainable irrigation of small scale dry land farming in Kitui Central District,
Kitui County, Kenya. The study sought to establish the extent to which adoption
of new irrigation technology, gravity free flow irrigation and access to access
to credit has influenced sustainable irrigation of small scale dry land farming.
Descriptive survey research design was adopted. A sample of 150 participants
was randomly selected from 1540 small-scale dry land irrigation farmers in the
district. Data was collected using questionnaires and an interview schedule.
Descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, including Pearson's correlation
coefficient and one way ANOVA were used to analyze quantitative data. Qualitative
data was analyzed by daily briefs, categorization into themes and narrations
of respondents' quotations and verbatim explanations. The .findings revealed
that irrigation of intensive, small scale dry-land farming yields statistically
significantly higher farm outputs from a 2-acre dry-land farm than the natural
rain-fed small scale dry-land farm of similar acreage at 95% confidence interval.
The study recommended that farmers and County governments should adopt both
indigenous and new technologies that are supportive to the development and
growth of small scale dry land farming. Further studies should be done' on the
relationship between training and sustainable irrigation of small scale dry land
farming to ensure successful artificial agricultural productivity from the Arid and

These two sites are found in biodiversity hotspots that support rare and endemic plant and animal species. The larger Embu and Taita benchmark areas were demarcated
into sampling areas which are referred to as windows ’W’ in this study. Site  characterization was carried out using the method provided by FAO-UNESCO for
characterizing and classifying soils. Further to this, attempts were made to establish land use intensity (LUI) and land productivity (PI) indices that provided land condition indicators. The soils in Taita Taveta benchmark site were classified as Plinthic Lixisols,
Plinthic Acrisols, Dystric Cambisols and Chromic Luvisols, while those from Embu ones were Rhodic Nitisols, Humic Nitisols, Humic Acrisols, Haplic Acrisols and Umbric Andosols. The highest level of soil organic carbon recorded was 7.6% in forest soils
while the intensely cultivated maize-based and horticultural systems recorded low C levels of 1.6%. Low land use intensity gradients (LUI) were observed in the forests with values less than 2%, while horticulture and maize-based systems recorded more
than 30%LUI. The productivity index (PI) followed a similar trend being highest in the natural forest and grassland (40-50%) and lowest in horticultural and maize-based systems (15-20%) It was concluded that the decline in soil quality and productivity was linked to increased land use intensification due to lack of knowledge of the appropriate management practices for sustainable ecosystem functions and services.

Province, Kenya, was investigated between May 2006 and December 2007 aiming at harnessing
their potential in the biological control of plant parasitic nematodes in the area.
Given that the intensity of land cultivation is continually increasing in the study area, it is
prudent to document the status of the nematode destroying fungi before the remaining
forest habitats are ultimately disrupted. Soil samples were collected from forest, maize/
bean, napier grass, shrub and vegetable fields, which represented the main land use types
in the study area. The soil sprinkle technique method was used to isolate the nematode
destroying fungi from the soil. The fungi were identified to species level. Eighty-five
isolates, distributed in eight genera and 14 taxa were identified as nematode destroying
fungi. The species identified were Arthrobotrys dactyloides, Arthrobotrys oligospora, Arthrobotrys
superba, Acrostalagamus obovatus, Dactyllela lobata, Harposporium aungulilae, Harposporium

"uonbi:11295/97747";"Use of Remote Sensing in Analysis of Effects of Urban Sprawl on Agricultural Land.case Study: Kiambaa Sub-county";"";"Urban Sprawl is the spreading out of a city and its suburbs over more and more rural land at the periphery of an urban area. This involves the conversion of rural land into built up, developed land over time. Sprawl is characterised by one or more existing patterns of development. Those most frequently mentioned are low-density, leapfrogging, distance to central facilities, dispersion of employment and residential development, and continuous strip development. Urban sprawl on agricultural lands has become a global phenomenon plaguing the entire world especially the developing countries due to increasing population at high rates and consequent depletion of resources.
Remote Sensing techniques are being used in this study to show how the technology can be utilized to solve this problem. Landsat TM (1988), ETM+ (2000) and OLI TIRS (2016) images were used to analyse the effects of urban sprawl on Agricultural land in Kiambaa sub-county. The study is limited to the change in spatial extent of urban areas and agricultural land in general. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood classifier was used to delineate land cover/use in Kiambaa Sub County. Post classification analysis was used for change detection.
The results show the agriculture land in Kiambaa Sub County had reduced with 11.4% from 1988 to 2000 and 14.1% from 2000 to 2016. The urban areas were found to have increased by more than 18 times in 2016 in the spatial extent more than in 1988.From the maps the urban sprawl was characterised by low density, leapfrogging and continuous strip developments. The direction of the sprawl was to the northern part of the sub county where most large and plantation farms are. The sprawl is also likely to flow to the neighbouring sub counties along the roads. The rate of change of agricultural land to urban reduced from 77 hectares per year between 1988-2000 to 72 hectares between 2000-2016.Although the sprawl was not at a high rate as expected, measures need to be taken early to avoid the issue getting out of control. Remote Sensing techniques proved to be an efficient and effective means of mapping and management of urban change.
For sustainability of agricultural activities measures need be taken on management and conservation of the existing land. The government should incorporate use of remote sensing and GIS in its entire sectors to enhance data sharing. County governments should also consider using Remote Sensing and GIS technologies to monitor Land cover/ use changes.";"Mungai, Teresiah W";"";"University of Nairobi";"University of Nairobi";"2016-12-31";"en";"land;research";"";"KEN";"Reports & Research";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/97747";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/97747/Mungai_Use%20of%20Remote%20Sensing%20in%20Analysis%20of%20Effects%20%20of%20Urban%20Sprawl%20on%20Agricultural%20Land.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y";"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/97747/Mungai_Use%20of%20Remote%20Sensing%20in%20Analysis%20of%20Effects%20%20of%20Urban%20Sprawl%20on%20Agricultural%20Land.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"";"";"Urban Sprawl on Agricultural Land";""

The study area was chosen because of its significant land use intensification. Soil washing and dilution plate techniques were used to recover Trichoderma spp from the soil samples. The fungal isolates were identified and assigned to eight species. Greater populations as well as a wider range of species were obtained in soils collected from the natural forests while coffee farms were the poorest ones. Land use affected the distribution of Trichoderma. Napier farms had the highest abundance of this fungus. The species which showed the highest incidence in all cases was T. harzianum. Plant type was a major determinant of the occurrence of this fungus. Trichoderma favored plants with shallow and widespread rooting systems, to the deeply
rooted perennial coffee and tea trees. The age of the plants also was a driving factor. Both
inorganic and organic fertilizers are used in the region. There was a negative correlation between amount of chemical fertilizers and abundance of the fungus. Organic fertilizers were used exclusively in napier farms that had the highest fungal abundance. Soil pH and amount of phosphorus were limiting and influenced the occurrence and abundance of this fungus. However carbon and nitrogen were not limiting though they were high in the forests and napier farms where the fungus was also abundant. Trichoderma showed tolerance to soil acidity since it was abundant in the most acidic soils under napier. Land intensification affected Trichoderma distribution negatively.";"Okoth, Sheila A

This study contributes by examining the community factors that could exert significant influence on determining whether or not a community receives FLDs in East African Community (EAC), focusing on Uganda. Uganda is an interesting case to investigate because the country is one of the destinations of FLDs in EAC apart from Kenya and Tanzania.
