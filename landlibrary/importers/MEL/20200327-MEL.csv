"mel:20.500.11766/5615";"Congruence of appropriation and provision in collective water provision in Central Namibia";"";"Achieving cooperation in natural resource management is always
a challenge when incentives exist for an individual to maximise her short term
benefits at the cost of a group. We study a public good social dilemma in water
infrastructure provision on land reform farms in Namibia. In the context of the
Namibian land reform, arbitrarily mixed groups of livestock farmers have to share
the operation and maintenance of water infrastructure. Typically, water is mainly
used for livestock production, and livestock numbers are subject to high fluctuations
due to the given environmental conditions. Our paper assesses how alternative
payment systems with differing congruence of provision and appropriation support
the cooperation in the group given the ever-changing equilibria. In a first step,
we conducted an exploratory overview of the social-ecological system of central
Namibian land reform projects. The Social Ecological System (SES) Framework
served as a guideline for this assessment (Ostrom 2009). Taking the complexity of
the cooperation situation into account, in the second step we designed a role-play
that is based on a social-ecological simulation model. The role-play simulates the
real-life decision situations of land reform beneficiaries wherein equilibria are
permanently changing. This approach helped us to not only better understand the
cooperation challenges of Namibian land reform beneficiaries, but also supported stakeholders in their decision making and institution building. Our study provides
evidence to support that land reform beneficiaries increase their contributions as
they own more livestock and as other group members increase their payments.
Nevertheless, only groups with relatively homogeneous livestock endowments
manage to agree on payment rules. Interestingly, the dominant rule is an “equal
payment per farmer” and not a “payment per head of livestock”, though the latter
would imply a higher congruence of provision and appropriation.";"Falk, Thomas

"mel:20.500.11766/5612";"Community Participation in Decentralized Management of Natural Resources in the Southern Region of Mali";"";"Decentralized governance of natural resources is considered one of the key strategies for promoting sustainable
management of natural resources at local level. Effective decentralized natural resource management requires
strong local natural resource institutions. Therefore, strengthening local institutions governing the management
of natural resources is one of the core principles of decentralization reforms in Francophone West Africa
countries. This study assessed the existing local institutions (rules, norms and or local conventions) governing
the management of natural resources and forms of community participation in the development of these natural
resource institutions. Our findings showed significant variation within the study sites regarding the level of
knowledge of existing local rules and norms governing the management of natural resources by the respondents.
Results showed that the level of knowledge of local conventions was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the
district of Bougouni than in the district of Koutiala (a score of 3.16 compared to 1.70 on a scale of 0 to 4).This
study shows also that participation was dominated by a small group of individuals, often community leaders and
elites. The results suggest that women are marginalized. Presently, the big challenge that faces the institutions
governing natural resource use in the study area is the system of representativeness in the community in the
development of local rules and norms as community leaders and household heads often dominate, which does
not encourage active participation of community members. Therefore, for effective implementation of local
natural resource institutions, the interest of key natural resource users should be taken into account. It is also
important to promote rules and norms that attempt to protect or strengthen women’s access to natural resources
in the community.";"Umutoni, Clarisse

inherent in technological options that shape the adoption of and land-use decisions in production
systems involving multiple crops in Ethiopia. By applying a fractional response model to a
nationally representative sample of 1 469 households, this paper found that, while there are tradeoffs
in the land-use decisions regarding barley and potatoes, there are complementarities in the
land-use decisions of their improved varieties. A striking result from this analysis is that the
frequency of extension visits does not affect land allocation among crops and their improved
varieties, which, in the light of the very high density of extension personnel in Ethiopia, shows the
poor performance of the extension service delivery system. These results imply that the analysis of
smallholder adoption decisions and agricultural technology targeting needs to consider all major
crops in the farmers’ portfolio, and Ethiopia should consider overhauling its extension service
delivery systems.";"Yigezu, Yigezu

suitability for restoration and the effectiveness of restoration
strategies in restoring ecosystem functioning and services. In
this review paper, several soil indicators, which can be used
to assess the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies
in dryland ecosystems at different spatial and temporal
scales, are discussed. The selected indicators represent the
different viewpoints of pedology, ecology, hydrology, and
land management. Two overall outcomes stem from the review.
(i) The success of restoration projects relies on a proper
understanding of their ecology, namely the relationships between
soil, plants, hydrology, climate, and land management
at different scales, which are particularly complex due to the
heterogeneous pattern of ecosystems functioning in drylands.
(ii) The selection of the most suitable soil indicators follows
a clear identification of the different and sometimes competing
ecosystem services that the project is aimed at restoring.";"Costantini, Edoardo

Rapid large-scale land use changes, poaching, climate change, rising population pressures, governance, policy, economic
and socio-cultural transformations and competition with livestock all contribute to the declines in abundance. Here we
analyze the population dynamics of 15 wildlife and four livestock species monitored using aerial surveys from 1977 to
2011 within Kajiado County of Kenya, with a rapidly expanding human population, settlements, cultivation and other
developments. The abundance of the 14 most common wildlife species declined by 67% on average (2% / yr) between
1977 and 2011 in both Eastern (Amboseli Ecosystem) and Western Kajiado. The species that declined the most were
buffalo, impala, wildebeest, waterbuck, oryx, hartebeest, Thomson’s gazelle and gerenuk in Eastern Kajiado (70% to
88%) and oryx, hartebeest, impala, buffalo, waterbuck, giraffe, eland and gerenuk in Western Kajiado (77% to 99%).
Only elephant (115%) and ostrich (216%) numbers increased contemporaneously in Eastern and Western Kajiado,
respectively. Cattle and donkey numbers also decreased on average by 78% in Eastern Kajiado and by 37% in Western
Kajiado. Sheep and goats decreased the least in Eastern (28%) but increased in Western (96%) Kajiadio. Livestock
dominated (70-80%) the total large herbivore biomass throughout the 1977-2011 monitoring period. The distribution of
wildlife contracted dramatically during 1977-2011, most especially for wildebeest, giraffe and impala. Only zebra and
ostrich distributions expanded in the county. However, livestock distribution expanded to densely cover most of the
county. Our findings point to recurrent droughts, intensifying human population pressures, land use changes and other
anthropogenic impacts, decades of ineffective or failed government policies, legislations, law enforcement, management
institutions and strategies as the salient causes of the declines and range compressions. We recommend several urgent
measures to rehabilitate the depleted wildlife populations and habitat richness, restore their ecological resilience to
droughts and secure pastoral livelihoods.";"Ogutu, Joseph O.

"mel:20.500.11766/8250";"Fighting Land Degradation in the Drylands: NRM Technologies for Crop– Livestock Farming";"";"A tragedy of the commons is unfolding in the rangelands of West Asia and North Africa (WANA), where land is either public or collectively owned. Overgrazing under this land tenure has led to severe land degradation and soil erosion. Poverty and environmental degradation are intertwined in this low-rainfall region, where more than 38 million people live in rural areas and depend mainly on agriculture. Traditional rangeland grazing provides fodder in winter and spring, while in summer and autumn the animals browse cereal stubble and other crop residues. But rangeland feed resources have shrunk from providing 70 per cent of animal feed requirements five decades ago to no more than 25 per cent today. This is mainly because there are more animals but also because of inappropriate land-use policies and lack of secure property rights, all of which fuel unsustainable land use. To stem the degradation, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and national partners in Morocco and Tunisia have designed alley cropping technologies that enhance fodder quality and quantity, thereby reducing pressure on the rangelands. The technologies were introduced on marginal lands in the two countries through the Mashreq/Maghreb (M&M) adaptive research project, which combined research on NRM with research on integrated crop–­livestock production.";"Shideed, Kamel

"mel:20.500.11766/5588";"Land use and cropping effects on carbon in black soils of semi-arid tropical India";"";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) and rainfall are generally
positively related, whereas a negative relationship
between soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and rainfall with
some exception is observed. Land use pattern in black
soil region (BSR) of the semi-arid tropical (SAT)
India, consists of 80% under agriculture, followed by
forest, horticulture, wasteland and permanent fallow.
For sustainable agriculture on these soils, there is a
concern about their low OC status, which warrants
fresh initiatives to enhance their OC status by suitable
management interventions. In the BSR region, cotton,
soybean and cereal-based systems dominate but it is
not yet clear as to which cropping system in the SAT
black soils is most suitable for higher OC sequestration.
Many short-term experiments on cotton or
cereal-based systems clearly suggest that cotton or
cereal-based cropping systems including leguminous
crops perform better in terms of SOC sequestration
whereas soybean–legume combination do not add any
substantial amount of OC. In sub-humid bioclimatic
zones (1053–1209 mm mean annual rainfall), soybean is
grown successfully with wheat or fallowing, and SOC
concentration is maintained at 0.75% in the 0.30 m soil
layer under integrated nutrient management. In view of
enhancement and maintenance of OC in many shortterm
experiments conducted in various agro-climate
zones of SAT, it is realized that OC accumulation in
soils of the semi-arid ecosystem with suitable cropping
and management practices could be substantial especially
in cotton–pigeon pea rotation, and thus the discussed
crop rotations in each major bio-climatic zone
stand for wide acceptance by the SAT farmers.";"Chaudhury, Swati

CA is specifically seen as a way to address the problems of soil degradation resulting from agricultural practices that deplete the organic matter and nutrient content of the soil. It aims at higher crop yields and lower production costs. Yet, success with adopting CA on farms in Africa has been limited (Kassam et al., 2009).
The European Commission has recently funded a collaborative project, CA2Africa (www.CA2Africa.eu), that seeks to better understand the reasons for the limited adoption of CA in Africa by analysing past and on-going CA experiences, in order to assess under which conditions and to what extent CA can strengthen the socio-economic position of smallholder farmers in Africa. A better comprehension of where, when and for whom CA works best, and how CA should be configured in different settings will enable the identification of knowledge gaps for future research, development and promotion of CA in Africa.";"El Mourid, Mohamad

Changes in climate patterns are having their most acute effect on people living in the world’s dry areas and marginal lands. As these rural communities are largely dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, it follows that improvements in agricultural research and 'integrated agro-ecosystem' approaches are probably the primary protection from climate related problems. This is also why agricultural innovation, research, technology transfer and capacity building should be strategic priorities of the UNFCCC.

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) interventions are used to increase soil moisture content, vegetation cover, and productivity. However, adoption of rainwater harvesting by communities is slow. To understand adoption constraints and to develop options for sustainable integration of rainwater harvesting, a benchmark watershed was established in the dry rangelands of Jordan. The objective is to develop a methodology for identifying the suitability for different rainwater harvesting interventions using participatory GIS approach and field survey. The main biophysical parameters used to assess the suitability for rainwater harvesting were slope, soil depth, soil texture, and stoniness. Criteria for each parameter were integrated and a suitability map was produced using raster-based and polygon-based analysis. To integrate biophysical and socio-economic aspects, the land tenure was superimposed with the suitability map. Options for implementing different rainwater harvesting interventions were identified with the participation of the local communities. Field investigations indicated that the applied approach helped to select the most promising fields. Within two years, four types of rainwater harvesting were implemented in the fields of 41 farmers, covering 62.9 hectares, which helped to increase water productivity (kg/m3) four folds and reducing soil erosion five folds compared to fields without rainwater harvesting. The approach showed that participatory GIS approach may be used to integrate socio-economic and biophysical criteria and facilitate the participation of farmers to introduce rainwater harvesting interventions in dry rangeland systems to mitigate land degradation.";"Ziadat, Feras M.

ten to twelve million ha per year, there is an
urgent need to scale up and out successful,
profitable and resource-efficient sustainable
land management practices to maintain the
health and resilience of the land that humans
depend on. As much as 500 million out of
two billion ha of degraded land, mainly in
developing countries, have restoration potential,
offering an immediate target for restoration
and rehabilitation initiatives.1 In the past,
piecemeal approaches to achieving sustainable
land management have had limited impact.
To achieve the ambitious goals of alleviating
poverty, securing food and water supplies,
and protecting the natural resource base, we
need to recognize the inter-connectedness of
the factors driving land degradation, so that
solutions can be taken to scale, transforming
management practices for millions of land users.
An analysis of the critical barriers and incentives
to achieve scaling up suggests that the most
appropriate options should be selected through
the involvement of stakeholders at all levels,
from local to national and international. New
incentives for land managers as well as the
public and private sectors are required to achieve

"mel:20.500.11766/7501";"ICARDA Annual Report 2008";"";"The year of 2008 marked the beginning of a new phase at ICARDA: the full implementation of the Center's Strategic Plan 2007-2016, and a renewed commitment to addressing the global challenges of food security, poverty alleviation and climate change in the dry areas. It was also a year of adversity, both locally and globally. At ICARDA's main research station in Syria, the 2007/2008 cropping season experienced drought combined with wide variations in temperature, falling to -12°C in winter and rising to 37°C in the early spring. This was the driest season in 38 years, with only 210 mm annual 
 rainfall compared with the long-term average of 340 mm.
Countries in West Asia and North Africa harvested only 40 to 50% of their normal rainfed crop production. In these adverse
conditions, we were pleased to see that lines of cereals and legumes developed jointly with our partners performed well.
2008 also witnessed global foodprice and economic crises and the specter of widespread food insecurity. Many countries in the dry areas that ICARDA serves were severely affected due to their dependence on cereal imports to meet their food demands. Their vulnerability to such fluctuations in global markets is exacerbated by low agricultural productivity and
the prospects of climate change.
The food crisis was a reminder of the vital role that agricultural research plays in ensuring food security and sustainable
development. The UN Secretary General urged nations to revitalize agriculture as a way of tackling the food crisis. The World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development underscored the importance of agriculture as the main engine of economic growth and rural development. ICARDA has been called upon by many national governments to assist in developing research and capacity development programs to enhance food security.
The 2007/2008 season at ICARDA was only one example of the intrinsic variability in climatic conditions, both within and
between seasons, in dry areas and provides a foretaste of future conditions. Climate models predict even more variability, aggravating the problems already facing farmers – highly variable rainfall, frequent drought, extremes of heat and cold, fragile ecosystems beset by land degradation, salinization, loss of biodiversity, and a host of plant diseases and insect pests.
ICARDA brings its past experience in addressing climatic variability to bear on tackling the effects of climate change more broadly, with greater emphasis on adaptation, mitigation, and ecosystem resilience. Many technologies developed by ICARDA and its partners will have direct and immediate benefits in strengthening communities' capacity to adapt to climate
change.
This Annual Report presents highlights of the Center's achievements in 2008 and examples of the integrated research approach that ICARDA takes in addressing its goals of achieving sustainable increases in agricultural productivity and
income, while ensuring the efficient and more equitable use and conservation of natural resources.
As we reflect on 2008, and the challenges that it presented, ICARDA is even more conscious of the importance of 
collaboration and partnerships, particularly with the national programs of the countries the Center serves, in
improving livelihoods and alleviating poverty in the dry areas.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2009-07-10";"en";"development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7501";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/XyrvzOd6";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/XyrvzOd6/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

"mel:20.500.11766/7508";"ICARDA Annual Report 2005";"";"The year 2005 was an important milestone in the efforts of ICARDA and its partners in meeting the global challenges of agriculture in dry areas through the application of science. In an assessment of all 15 CGIAR Centers (based on science quality and relevance, impacts, partnerships, and financial and institutional health), conducted by the CGIAR in collaboration with the Science Council and the World Bank, ICARDA was rated outstanding"" - one of only two centers to receive this rating. To maintain - and even exceed - this level of performance, the Center restructured its research portfolio in 2005. Ongoing research projects were carefully reviewed, and consolidated under six Mega-Projects, focusing on core issues: water management, crop improvement, desertification, crop-livestock systems, poverty and livelihoods, and knowledge dissemination. This consolidation, we believe, will optimize synergies, sharpen our poverty focus, and use the Center's collective skills and resources most effectively.
Monitoring and evaluation is a continuous, ongoing process at ICARDA. Three Center-Commissioned External Reviews (CCER) took place during the year, focusing on specific areas: integrated gene management, natural resource management, and human capacity building. While the report on human capacity building had not been finalized at the time of going to press, the other two CCER reports were extremely positive. However, they did identify some opportunities for improvement; the Center has already begun taking the necessary action to respond to the recommendations of those
reports.
Improved varieties remain the backbone of agricultural development efforts. ICARDA's integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to plant breeding continued to pay rich dividends. In 2005, fifteen improved varieties of different crops (wheat, barley, chickpea, faba bean, lentil, forages) were released in countries within and beyond the CWANA (Central and West Asia and North Africa) region.
ICARDA and the United Nations University, Japan, signed an agreement to launch a new South-South partnership to combat desertification. This global network on integrated natural resources management, named 'CWANA-Plus Partnership', will target the vast CWANA region, as well as large parts of China, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives include sharing expertise and facilities, training developing-country scientists, expanding postgraduate degree programs in integrated land management, and promoting improved practices among small-scale farmers. ICARDA and CIMMYT, with a common interest in wheat improvement research, have long worked closely together. The two centers further strengthened their collaboration by establishing a joint ICARDA/CIMMYT Wheat Improvement Program for the CWANA region at ICARDA. A Director was appointed to lead the program. Also, the two centers, in partnership with national programs, launched a Global Rust Initiative (GRI) in September 2005 in response to a sudden, largescale outbreak of a new strain of wheat stem rust. Several countries in East Africa are affected; smallscale farmers in Kenya have lost as much as half their wheat harvest. The CWANA region stands at risk, so immediate action needs to be taken. The GRI embodies all that the CGIAR System stands for – expertise in strategic research, global partnerships, a focus on resource-poor smallholder farmers, and the ability and commitment to react swiftly to challenges.
Nobel Laureate Dr Norman Borlaug, father of the Green Revolution, visited ICARDA headquarters in May 2005 and addressed the ""CWANA Wheat Meeting"", jointly organized by ICARDA and CIMMYT. The Center suffered a major blow when Dr Robert D. Havener – one of ICARDA's founding fathers and a mentor to many of our scientists – passed away in August 2005. His memory will continue to inspire us.
The achievements of ICARDA and its partners presented in this Annual Report would not have been possible without the strong support of our  onors.

"mel:20.500.11766/7509";"ICARDA Annual Report 2003";"";"Strong partnerships with national agricultural research systems and other stakeholders constitute the backbone of ICARDA’s research agenda. The outreach programs of the Center play a key role in promoting partnerships in their respective sub-regions and in implementing collaborative research and training programs. To make an assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the partnerships, the Board of Trustees of ICARDA commissioned an external review of its outreach programs in 2003. The distinguished Review Panel reaffirmed the success of ICARDA in enabling dry-area countries in the world to become fully involved in, and benefit from its programs. The Panel also noted that the Center is held in high esteem by national scientists, research managers, and policy makers in the Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region—ICARDA’s eco-geographic mandate area.
Within the context of contributing to the Millennium Development Goals, the Center made a strong case at the World Water Forum, held in Japan, and at the International Conference on the Development of Dry Lands, held in Iran, about the urgent need to address the issue of water shortages that are threatening food security in the dry areas, and proposed actions that could lead to sustainable use of natural resources and help alleviate poverty and hunger. The Center
also actively participated in the project development for Challenge Programs on “Water and Food “ and “Biofortified Crops for Improved Nutrition,” and three of its six projects submitted were approved for funding.
The use of cutting-edge science is becoming more crucial in addressing the daunting global challenges of producing more with less land and water to feed the increasing populations, while protecting the health of the natural resource base. During the year, ICARDA made significant strides in the use of such tools as biotechnology, geographical information systems and expert systems to develop crop varieties that can withstand stressful conditions, and technologies for
improved water conservation and use efficiency.
Conflicts in the CWANA region continued to pose challenges for the Center. During the year, our work to rebuild agriculture in Afghanistan continued with increased emphasis on seed systems and capacity building, while preparations were set in motion to support rebuilding agriculture in Iraq. A collaborative work plan was developed in partnership with senior Iraqi
officials and scientists. Implementation of the plan began during the later part of the year, and is expected to gain momentum in 2004. Our work in the Palestinian territories, mainly through human resource development, providing seeds of improved varieties and assisting in agrobiodiversity conservation using natural resource management practices, continued despite the prevailing difficult situation there.
In presenting this Annual Report to our readers, we would like to extend ICARDA’s grateful thanks to donors for their continued support to the Center’s research and training activities.

"mel:20.500.11766/8076";"Mapping Cropland Abandonment in the Aral Sea Basin with MODIS Time Series";"";"Cropland abandonment is globally widespread and has strong repercussions for regional
food security and the environment. Statistics suggest that one of the hotspots of abandoned cropland
is located in the drylands of the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), which covers parts of post-Soviet Central Asia,
Afghanistan and Iran. To date, the exact spatial and temporal extents of abandoned cropland remain
unclear, which hampers land-use planning. Abandoned land is a potentially valuable resource for
alternative land uses. Here, we mapped the abandoned cropland in the drylands of the ASB with a
time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2003–2016. To overcome the restricted ability of a single
classifier to accurately map land-use classes across large areas and agro-environmental gradients,
“stratum-specific” classifiers were calibrated and classification results were fused based on a locally
weighted decision fusion approach. Next, the agro-ecological suitability of abandoned cropland areas
was evaluated. The stratum-specific classification approach yielded an overall accuracy of 0.879,
which was significantly more accurate (p < 0.05) than a “global” classification without stratification,
which had an accuracy of 0.811. In 2016, the classification results showed that 13% (1.15 Mha) of
the observed irrigated cropland in the ASB was idle (abandoned). Cropland abandonment occurred
mostly in the Amudarya and Syrdarya downstream regions and was associated with degraded
land and areas prone to water stress. Despite the almost twofold population growth and increasing
food demand in the ASB area from 1990 to 2016, abandoned cropland was also located in areas
with high suitability for farming. The map of abandoned cropland areas provides a novel basis for
assessing the causes leading to abandoned cropland in the ASB. This contributes to assessing the
suitability of abandoned cropland for food or bioenergy production, carbon storage, or assessing the
environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.";"Loew, Fabian

"mel:20.500.11766/8852";"Impact of Expanding Supplemental Irrigation in the Upper Karkheh River Basin (Iran) on Downstream Flow";"";"The Karkheh River Basin (KRB) of Iran has a semi-arid to arid climate and suffers from low rainfed agricultural productivity. Supplemental irrigation (SI) is recommended in the upper KRB to increase crops yields and water productivity (WP). However, development activities upstream will certainly affect the water quality and quantity ﬂowing to the Karkheh Dam downstream. In this study, suitable areas for SI are basically rainfed and characterized by the presence of arable soils, non-constraining slopes, agricultural land use, and within a distance from, or an elevation difference with, existing irrigation schemes that does not impose uneconomical costs for water conveyance or pumping.
Two methods are examined for targeting suitable lands for SI development. The irrigated areas buffer method and the rivers buffer method. The potential future situation with SI is evaluated by assuming various scenarios at the upstream sub-basins. Current runoff in the upstream KRB is assessed using a surface water balance in a GIS framework. Water demand and new runoff maps were then simulated. A map of potential areas for SI at the upstream sub-basins was prepared using the intersecting layers method within the GIS framework. The results show that 31.4% of the rainfed areas suitable for SI development are located approximately within a 1000 m buffer distance of the irrigated ﬁelds, while the rivers buffer areas cover 46.5% of the suitable rainfed areas. The latter value is assumed to be more realistic for the potential expansion of SI.
Four slope priorities in 53 sub-basins and four precipitation scenarios – normal precipitation conditions, normal conditions with an environmental ﬂow consideration, drought conditions, and drought conditions with an environmental ﬂow consideration – are considered in investigating the upstream-downstream interactions. The SI scenarios include full SI (satisfying any deﬁciency of rainfall), SI for early sowing (100 mm in autumn), and two levels of deﬁcit SI strategies (total 150 mm) involving water that would be conveyed from the rivers considered as buffers.
A FORTRAN program was written to calculate the water allocations for the upstream subbasins. The results indicate that the amount of water allocated to SI in normal seasons could decrease downstream ﬂow by 15%.Under drought conditions the reduction may amount to 10% of the current ﬂow, if all the potentially suitable areas for SI are developed. Furthermore, for an assessment of the effect of developing SI at the upper Karkheh subbasins on the water quality of the Karkheh River and the Karkheh Dam, a simpliﬁed Water and Salinity Basin Model (WSBM) was developed. The model was calibrated and used to analyze current and past water extractions.
Despite the simplicity of the model, the observed and simulated stream ﬂows and salinity are similar, proving that the model could be used for scenario analyses. The ﬁrst scenario was setup to analyze the effect of a single SI of 75 mm in the autumn for about 140,000 ha of rainfed areas. This scenario has no signiﬁcant effect on the water quality of the Karkheh Dam. The results of a second scenario, deﬁned to evaluate the effect of a single SI of 75 mm in the spring for about 200,000 ha of rainfed lands, shows negligible effects compared to the annual ﬂows of the river.
The third scenario, a combination of the ﬁrst and second scenarios, produced similar results that indicate a 3.9% increase in water salinity. The last scenario consisted of two SI, each of 75mm, in the spring at the heading and milky stages. In this scenario the water salinity of the river increased from 0.8 to 1.2d S/m, but the Karkheh Dam water salinity increases by 4.1%.";"Hessari, Behzad

"mel:20.500.11766/5714";"Land degradation and the Sustainable Development Goals: Threats and potential remedies";"";"The concern for the well-being of land is often directly related to one’s proximity to the land, be it physically, economically or culturally. Land is more precious if one’s livelihood depend on it immediately than if one is merely a visitor. Land is valued differently if it is the base of one’s power or wealth than if one’s community is in need of its integrity and depends on the ecosystem services (ESS) that it provides. To some extent, this may explain the great challenge UNCCD has experienced in mustering international support for its mandate. De facto, the degradation of land has long been seen as a local concern, and in contrast with climate water pollution, not one that would affect populations beyond the location where the problem originated. The arrival of environmental migrants far from the affected regions is contributing to a change of vision and increased urgency to counter land degradation.
With the international community taking note of this paradigm shift, the SDGs have addressed the issue head on in SDG 15 and in formulating an objective of land degradation neutrality (LDN). However, development has a number of aspects that may not easily be reconciled with sustainable development. Urbanization, alleviating pressure on land resources, involves the loss of (often) prime land and ESS saving urbanization concepts such as near-natural urbanization and waste recycling are in their infancy. Globalization distributes jobs and wealth on a large scale but also moves large amounts of nutrients around the world often to the detriment of the delivering and the receiving regions. On a local scale, SDGs themselves may be difficult to reconcile as the pursuit of one SDG may be at the expense of another. Many of these dilemmas are grounded in the multiple ecosystem services that are derived from land and their complex interaction and the different scales at which stakeholders are demanding these services. Research on these complex socio-ecological systems is rapidly evolving with the help of modern tools including systems modelling, big data and geo-observation equipment, but given the SDG aspirations for 2030, the scientific community is engaged in a game of catch up. Society as a whole is conflicted as it is polarized when it comes to acknowledging the seriousness and complexity of the problems of sustainable development and its associated costs and benefits.
Land degradation is a complicating factor in reaching many of the SDGs, not only SDG 15 but many of the others such as the elimination of hunger, the provision of biodiversity, clean water and renewable energy, climate change mitigation and sustainable urban environments that all depend on healthy land resources. Through its effect on individual SDGs, land degradation can have systemic effects on other, both land and not land-related SDGs, e.g. land degradation that reduces food security in marginal areas contributes to increasing global and national inequalities. Although the phenomenology of land degradation is well known, knowledge on the extent and cost of it is patchy and far from precise. Whatever the approach or methodology used to calculate the costs of land degradation, these costs are very high. There is an urgent need to develop tools and databases that will take stock of the state of our land, which then can serve as a baseline against which LDN can be monitored. Despite the uncertainties, it is consensus that the cost of land degradation is enormous and if not arrested will be a serious drain on the world economy, in particular on the weaker economies of the world. 
In the quest against land degradation, the scale of engagement is paramount. The scope of a traditional custodian of our land, the farmer, in combating land degradation is often limited to the benefits he would reap. Many of the measures that can combat land degradation involve investments and for the farmer to do his share he will have to be secure in the rights to or use of the land and he has to have the resources to make adjustments in the management of his land. Climate-smart agriculture practices and conservation agriculture are management options for sustainable agriculture but their effect is limited in the context of the SDGs if they are not brought to scale and tied in with a sustainable land and landscape effort. Only at this scale the public benefits will become obvious. This requires collective action, based on stakeholder involvement and the latest science and be based on principle of development, equity and social justice. 
There is an increasing awareness of the need for integrated management of land and water resources (ILWM) at the watershed and landscape level. Land management needs to spare water and water management needs to optimize ESS from land while satisfying the needs for water in multiple sectors.  Keeping in mind the many purposes of these resources, ILWM should derive the optimal mix of ESS without diminishing the resource base. Finding win-win options or the best trade-offs of land use and management based on resource endowment and stakeholder needs is a novel endeavor with which the scientific community is slowly coming to terms. At the community level the need to manage landscapes is increasingly recognized. Integrated landscape management to allocate land to different uses in order to retain or regain the integrity of the landscape.  
Policymakers are recognizing the need for action and are aiming to provide the institutional environment, markets and (dis-) incentives to support communities that are ready to act. Given the complexity of the socio-ecological systems, the scientific solutions and recommendations are often unknown or untested. Aware of the urgency of action, many communities and policymakers are experimenting with potential solutions of their own. The scientific community is following these experiments and documenting them.
From the experiments of the past decades, we can draw a number of lessons. Agricultural research has to expand its focus from field and plot research to landscape research and in the process should look at the cost of production by internalizing environmental cost. In some situations, the public cost of agriculture in marginal environments outweighs the private gains even with the best technologies in place. Land-use and city planners will increasingly have to address the cost of occupying productive agricultural land or the conversion of natural habitats. There is a great need to close nutrient cycles and improve the efficiency of external inputs. Landscape designs and urban planning should aim for the conservation of resources, the restoration of biodiversity and the optimal delivery of ESS. Land degradation issues are local in nature as the problems, the social context and the stakeholder communities are rarely the same. As a result, solutions to land degradation can rarely be generalized. As a result, LDN will be met only through a multitude of efforts, tailored to the conditions of the landscape, community and national interests in a process of negotiations at each level. If land degradation is not held in check, the grounds on which the SDGs are build may be slipping beyond reach.";"Vlek, Paul

It was a sign that we have to act fast to enhance the resilience of dryland farmers, who not only have to contend with more extreme temperatures but also face rapidly depleting water resources and the destructive effects of new pests and disease.
Farmers are on the frontline in the fight against climate change. Many are already struggling to produce sufficient food, particularly in the dry areas of the developing world, where shifting weather patterns are generating immense challenges and food import burdens continue to grow, exposing ordinary people to the vagaries of global commodity markets. 
Delivering practical solutions that farmers can utilize to raise their productivity is therefore critical: improved climate-resilient crops, sustainable land and water management practices, enhanced livestock productivity, and valueadded production are key to effective climate change adaptation. Each forms an integral part of ICARDA’s new Research Strategy (2017–2026), which supports the Center’s vision of thriving and resilient livelihoods.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2017-06-30";"en";"agriculture;development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/4952";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/v8EADc7E";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/v8EADc7E/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

The agriculture sector is predicted to take the heaviest toll, with the hardest hit being smallholder farmers in developing countries, particularly in dry areas. With rising temperatures and greater stress on water resources, agricultural productivity is set to experience a substantial decline. Yet against these odds, we need to produce progressively more to feed a rapidly growing world population.
The good news is that science and technology are increasingly and unambiguously showing us ways to overcome these hurdles, through cutting-edge approaches like genomics, biotechnology, geo-informatics, climate-smart agriculture and systems modeling tools. 
We are pleased to share these select scientific innovations and impacts of our agricultural research on drylands in 2014, where the challenges with scarce natural resources are even starker.

"mel:20.500.11766/4956";"Biomass Productivity-Based Mapping of Global Land Degradation Hotspots";"";"Land degradation affects negatively the livelihoods and food security of
global population. There have been recurring efforts by the international community
to identify the global extent and severity of land degradation. Using the long-term
trend of biomass productivity as a proxy of land degradation at global scale, we
identify the degradation hotspots in the world across major land cover types. We
correct factors confounding the relationship between the remotely sensed vegetation
index and land-based biomass productivity, including the effects of inter-annual
rainfall variation, atmospheric fertilization and intensive use of chemical fertilizers.
Our findings show that land degradation hotpots cover about 29 % of global land
area and are happening in all agro-ecologies and land cover types. This figure does
not include all areas of degraded lands, it refers to areas where land degradation is
most acute and requires priority actions in both in-depth research and management
measures to combat land degradation. About 3.2 billion people reside in these
degrading areas. However, the number of people affected by land degradation is
likely to be higher as more people depend on the continuous flow of ecosystem
goods and services from these affected areas. Land improvement has occurred in
about 2.7 % of global land area during the last three decades, suggesting that with
appropriate actions land degradation trend could be reversed. We also identify
concrete aspects in which these results should be interpreted with cautions, the
limitations of this work and the key areas for future research.";"Le, Quang Bao

The shortage of rain in middle and southern Iraq pushes farmers to depend on irrigated agriculture especially from its main resource Euphrates and Tigris and their tributaries. As the incoming water resource of these two rivers is decreasing continuously in Iraq, this would dictate that farmers should adopt modern irrigation technique which decrease the loss in water and improve the water productivity per area unit in addition to the role of these techniques in increasing productivity and decreasing production costs. To achieve the Iraqi ministry of agriculture in cooperation with the ICARDA applied a set of techniques in Iraq to solve this problem. Among those techniques is Sub-surface Drip Irrigation (SDI) technique which was applied on a group of cucumber farmers. The importance of this technique in developing agricultural sector and the shortage of knowledge regarding the factors affecting the adoption of this technique, it is necessary to study the reasons that make farmers do not adopt the technique. The objective of this study is to determine main factors that affect farmer's decisions to adopt the technique and the important factors in explaining farmer's decisions in study region (Abu Ghraib region) and to deduce results which may help in developing the intervention policies to encourage the technique adoption, The study consists of four chapters and an introduction, the first chapter contained two sections, the first one dealt with research methodology while the second one concentrated on literature review. The second chapter was the theoretical framework and it contained three sections, the first section explained the logistic regression for the most important factors affecting the adoption of (SDI). The second section dealt with Cost- Benefit Analysis (CBA), while the third section explained ADOPT analysis as a technique used to predict the adoption of the new agricultural techniques. The third chapter concentrated on the reality of agricultural production in Iraq, and it contained four sections, the first one the nature of production, area and yield of cucumber in Iraq and Baghdad province for the period (1990-2015) with reference to nutritional and economic importance of cucumber. The second section tackled the price trend of cucumber during the period (1990-2015), the third section dealt with the incoming water
rater resource situation for Iraq in general and for Baghdad province in particular. Also it discussed the modern irrigation techniques and its role in agricultural sector development; it also shed light on the nature of (SDI) and its role in developing the cucumber farmer's income who applied the technique. The fourth section discussed the role of ICARDA in developing agricultural sector in Iraq. The fourth chapter concentrated on results and discussion and contained four sections; the first section dealt with social and economic characteristic of study sample, while the second section discussed the economic analysis of factors affecting the adoption of (SDI) technique by using logistic regression, the third section discussed the (CBA) for farmers adopting and for non-adopting farmers. The fourth section discussed the prediction of adopting (SDI) by farmers through using ADOPT program. It appears that economic and social variables had a big role in adopting (SDI) technique. The results showed that the variables; farmer age, farmer's education level, the source of information, gave level of significance to affect the adoption at 1% level of significance. The variables; the water source, profit expectation and cucumber price, showed significance to affect on the technique adoption at 5%level. The result of (CBA) showed that is economically feasible to use (SDI) technique through a number of indicators among them: net revenues as it amounted to I.D 4.5 million/ house in the case of the technique adoption, as it was higher than the net revenues in case of without using the technique which amounted to I.D 2.5 million/ house. The internal rate of return was 41.88% and return to cost ratio was 2.27% as it indicated that the invested dinar in (SDI) yields 2.27 dinars. The results of ADOPT program showed that it is expected that 95% of farmers will adopt the technique through time period of 15.5 years. The sensitivity analysis showed that this period could be decreased or increased through affecting some factors. The result showed that the adoption of (SDI) on a large scale would contribute in improving the farmer's standard of living and achieving part of development objectives in agricultural sector. According to results the study arrived at some conclusions and recommendations.";"Farhan, Mohammed Khalid Mohammed";"";"Ministry of Water Resources - Iraq (MOWR - Iraq)";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2017-10-16";"ar";"land;research";"";"145;IRQ";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/9617";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/Y52TBuHh";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/Y52TBuHh/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

It varies substantially over time and space, for example, continuous expansion in northeastern China and rapid loss in southern China in the past decades. However, no maps at fine spatial resolution (e.g., 30-m) are available to document and illustrate the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of paddy rice planting areas in China. We recently developed an automated, Landsat-based paddy rice mapping system (RICE-Landsat) that uses time series Landsat images and a pixel- and phenology-based algorithm to identify and map paddy rice planting areas. The algorithm is built upon the unique spectral properties of paddy rice during the flooding, transplanting and early part of vegetation growth phases, during which periods the rice paddy field is essentially a mixed pixel of water and green plants with open canopy. In addition, we also used MODIS land surface temperature data and/or air temperature data to define the thermal growing season, which is then used to select appropriate Landsat images in the data analysis. In this presentation, we will introduce the RICE-Landsat processing system, and showcase its applications in tracking the dynamics of paddy rice planting areas in northeastern China over the period of 1986-2015. Our presentation will cover additional case studies beyond the recent publication (Dong et al., 2015, Remote Sensing of Environment).";"Xiao, Xiangming

A model was developed to simulate stocking rate based on communal grazing land. The model is weather and resource (feed supply) driven. Pasture growth and dynamics was modeled using rainfall and temperature data. Herd dynamics was based on age groups of male and female animals from birth to herd exit, taking production and reproduction parameters into account. To simulate sustainable stocking rate, a common unit (Tropical Livestock Unit, TLU) was used to represent the various classes of sheep. A higher stocking rate was observed in the long rainy season when the green pasture supply is higher. However, stocking rate was decreased with decrease in green and dry standing pasture in the long and short dry seasons. Application of the sustainable stocking rate in reality can be challenging since farmers keep large flocks and the pasture land is owned by groups of farmers. More awareness creation, including practical show-cases of the benefits of variation of stocking rate based on available resources, is needed to convince farmers in this and many other regions of Ethiopia.";"Gebre, Kahsa Tadel

over-exploitation of the ecosystem services and a changing climate towards drier seasons and highly
erratic rainfalls. In the recent decades, the once productive grazing lands transformed into sparsely
vegetated and crusted desert grounds not capable of retaining the sporadic rainwater within the landscape
- and consequentialsurface runoff inevitably acceleratessoil erosion and gullying. To counter-measure the
imminent rangeland degradation the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas
(ICARDA) is investigating mechanized micro Water Harvesting (WH) based restoration technique using the
Vallerani plow. This technique intermediately breaks up the crusted surface soil layers and hard pans to
approximately 50cm depth. Thus, creating dispersed micro-catchments, well-protected and suitable for
the plantation ofshrub seedlings, supporting the initial vegetation growth and eventually leading to shrubisland
evolvement over the landscape. However, optimum design, particularly the spacing between the
WH plow lines, depend on various environmental conditions. In this research, Rangeland Hydrology and
Erosion Model (RHEM) was used to assess degraded rangeland hydrological response to transparently
suggest on WH layout optimized for the magnitudes and the occurrence probabilities of runoff, soil erosion
and sediment accumulation affecting the storage capacity of the micro-catchments. The study combined
physical based modeling and ground truthing through different runoff and sediment related experiments.
Preliminary results demonstrate good potential of the RHEM-based WH design approach; case study
results will be presented for the first time at the conference. Eventually, a fully developed rangeland
assessment system will support transparent target area selection and sound WH design interlinked with a
risk analysis approach that accounts for the variable environmental patterns of the Badia.";"Strohmeier, Stefan

In the non-tropical dry areas where ICARDA works we are becoming accustomed to record high temperatures and increasing water scarcity year on year. Resilience and climate change adaptation are at the heart of ICARDA’s new Strategic Plan 2017-2026 – a bold and ambitious effort to harness cutting-edge science and deliver the tools and technologies that smallholder farmers need to maintain agricultural production and protect their livelihoods. Launched in the year when ICARDA celebrated its 40th anniversary, the new Strategic Plan builds on four decades of past achievements and successful partnerships. It is also demand driven and targets critical components of sustainable dryland food production systems. Innovation, adaptation, and resilience are critical to the long-term viability of productive agriculture in dry areas. The bold and ambitious ideas driving our new strategic direction reflect this – and help us to learn from past experiences, anticipate future challenges, and deliver the tools that farmers and rural communities need to thrive.";"Durrell, Jack";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2018-07-14";"en";"capacity building;farmers;food security;rangelands;water management";"Land & Food Security;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"014;015;034;145;AFG;EGY;ETH;IND;IRN;IRQ;JOR;LBN;MAR;PSE;SDN;SYR;TUN";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8319";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/1bcae4856996cb11866652ff47c1dd03";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/1bcae4856996cb11866652ff47c1dd03/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

Several federal agencies in the 1980s and 1990s determined that livestock grazing had adversely impacted a majority of federal lands in this region. In response, management was changed on grazing allotments to focus on stream system health. Recent advanced global positioning system (GPS) logging capabilities, both accuracy and frequency/ duration of logging, coupled with rapidly developing geographic information system (GIS) analytical capabilities allowed evaluation of livestock use of streams and riparian zones on mountain rangelands.This study was undertaken to clarify spatiotemporal characteristics of cattle use of perennial streams and associated riparian areas under current US Forest Service (USFS) management and to suggest managerial strategies with the potential to maintain or improve riverine environments. We initiated a five year study in 2008 to evaluate the use by cattle of 30 m (98.4 ft) and 60 m (196.9 ft) buffers on permanent streams on three extensive study sites in northeastern Oregon.The three study sites cover 43,972 ha (108,700 ac) within a broader region 120 km (74.5 mi) north-south by 50 km (31 mi) east-west.Ten randomly selected cows from herds grazing each site were fitted with GPS collars that recorded position, date, and time at approximately five minute intervals throughout the grazing season. Nearly 3,750,000 cow positions were collected on the allotments during the study.The relative occupancy of cattle in buffers along both sides of perennial streams were determined on an annual and monthly basis by site. Each position was tagged with the date and time of occurrence. Relative use within 30 m of the stream varied substantially from site to site (0.74% to 2.54%), month to month (0.00% to 5.21%), and year to year (0.86% to 2.13%). In some months, GPS data indicated that watering was nearly exclusive from streams. In other months, stream use was low or nil, and watering was from water developments, small springs, seeps, puddles, or other source. Cattle preferred to access streams at specific locations where streambank slope, the lack of physical obstructions, and solid footing facilitated water access.";"Johnson, Douglas E.

"mel:20.500.11766/8755";"Challenges and opportunities of soil conservation and land management in the dry areas";"";"Land degradation is a serious problem, particularly on vulnerable agricultural lands to soil erosion, which
signifies the temporary or permanent decline in the productive capacity of the land (UN/FAO definition).
Erosion is one of the most common problems around the world. Sanders (2004) considers that erosion
and soil degradation issues have contributed to the decline of great civilizations in Egypt, China or
Greece. The annual costs of soil erosion in the US are estimated between US$ 30 billion and US$ 44
billion (Morgan, 2005). In the dry areas, soil erosion is strongly contributing to desertification, which is a
serious problem in many countries in Asia and Africa (UNEP, 2000). The on-site effect of erosion are particularly important on agricultural lands where it leads to an important loss of fertility which can ultimately leads to an abandonment of the land (Morgan, 2005). Erosion also creates environmental damages through sedimentation pollution and increased flooding. Thus, off-site effects costs can often outweigh those arising from the loss of soil in agricultural fields.
Furthermore, eroded soil may loss 75 to 80% of their carbon content (Morgan, 2005) and so contribute
to climate change by emission of carbon in the atmosphere.
Soil erosion is particularly important problem in developing countries where a large part of the population lives in rural area. Most of the rural incomes are depending on natural resources. Erosion
control and land conservation are, in this context, crucial issues. This brief paper explains efforts to reduce soil erosion and improve soil fertility. The approach followed relies on assessing the extent and  distribution of soil erosion in the dry areas, promoting the
implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) interventions taking into consideration the biophysical and socio-economic environments. Sustainable development of areas affected by land degradation in the dry areas required knowledge of the impact of SWC interventions in reducing soil erosion and improving soil productivity and fertility.";"Ziadat, Feras M.";"";"Islamic Development Bank";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2013-02-18";"en";"land degradation;land management";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Conference Papers & Reports";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8755";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/vlVJlLX5";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/vlVJlLX5/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

Within rangelands, there are landscape depressions or lowlands characterized by high production potentials with their unique edaphic and hydrologic properties. The purpose of this ongoing research is to evaluate the effect of grazing exclusion on the vegetation characteristics and plant community structure in the arid lowland pastoral ecosystems. Plots were randomly identified within two distinct lowlands in Majidya and Sabha, in the Jordanian Badia. Preliminary results indicate that the total biomass and plant density widely differed between the open grazed and protected areas (P<0.001) in both sites. Total annual dry matter production was 954 kg ha-1 for protected and 151 kg ha-1 for open grazed areas in Majidya and 1749 kg ha-1 for protected and 20 kg ha-1 for open grazed areas in Sabha. The average plant densities in open grazed areas were 29 and 16 plants/m2, compared to 83 and 612 plants/m2 in protected areas in Majidya and Sabha, respectively. These results indicate that plant community structure is greatly affected by livestock grazing and that a site’s ability to recover from disturbance over time may be limited. Therefore, carefully planned grazing management is needed to achieve greater rangeland productivity and diversity.";"Hassan, Sawsan

"mel:20.500.11766/6391";"Overlooked benefits and services of grasslands to support policy reform";"";"Despite their ecological, economic and social importance, Mediterranean grasslands continue to receive limited scientific, political and media attention. Grasslands are typically viewed as underutilized space, able to be transformed into more “valuable” land by placing it under cultivation, transforming it into forest land and/or privatizing it. This paper synthesizes a number of pertinent issues in relation to social and economic systems on grasslands within the southern Mediterranean region. One effective avenue for drawing more attention to the need for preserving grasslands is to emphasize the economic aspects and benefits of grasslands, relative to the costs of degradation and the cost of inaction. This paper defines marketable and non-marketable goods that are not clearly defined in the literature of sustainable grassland management. When goods are clearly defined payment for environmental services is feasible. Providing an enabling environment for community-based land use and decision-making may foster an acceptance of schemes for community-based payment for ecosystem services on grasslands. There is a need for policies which provide security in property rights, risk reducing strategies, and that take into account both technical and socioeconomic constraints to ensure adequate incentives for participation in grassland management. This is important as mismanagement and climate change have led to further degradation. Land tenure practices and improper policies can also act as indirect drivers of grassland degradation. When farmers and herders lose control or long-term security over the land they use, the incentives for maintain environmentally sustainable practices are lost.";"Louhaichi, Mounir

"mel:20.500.11766/7624";"ICARDA Annual Report 2004";"";"In 2004, ICARDA began strategic visioning, driven by the global focus on achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the realignment of the CGIAR System priorities by the Science Council. It involved, among other actions, a consolidation of the 19 research projects into six mega-projects for better integration of the Center’s multidisciplinary teams, and an increased use of new tools of science in addressing the problems of poverty and degradation of natural resources. The new, poverty-focused research portfolio, scheduled to be implemented from 1 January 2005, encompasses a number of new avenues including improved income generation from high-value crops and adding value to staple crop and
livestock products; rehabilitating agriculture in countries affected by conflict; and closer alignment of agricultural research with mainstream development programs through research-for development applications.
Implementation of research projects under the Challenge Program on Water and Food got off to a good start, with activities in Eritrea on barley improvement and in the Kerkheh river basin in Iran on water productivity. In addition, ICARDA continued to play a leading role in international fora on issues related to the development of agriculture in dry areas.
Working with ICARDA, at least 13 countries released more than 35 improved cereal and food and feed legume varieties in 2004. The key traits of the improved varieties include better yields, resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance to cold and drought.
ICARDA continued its work to rebuild agricultural systems in Afghanistan. During the year, under the Research in Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF) projects, supported by DFID (Department for International Development, UK), the Center started work on developing and promoting innovative alternative livelihood options for rural Afghans who are currently economically dependent on opium poppy. The Center also strengthened its activities on technology transfer, established village-based seed enterprises, and introduced protected agriculture in Afghanistan under the Rebuilding Agricultural Markets in Afghanistan (RAMP) program, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
The Center was privileged to host the inaugural meeting of the CGIAR Science Council, and the annual meetings of the CGIAR Center Board Chairs Committee (CBC), and Center Directors Committee (CDC) in May 2004.

"mel:20.500.11766/7623";"ICARDA Annual Report 2006";"";"ICARDA witnessed several important developments in 2006. Of these, the Fifth External Program and Management Review (EPMR) was the most significant, as it provided a comprehensive assessment of the Center's global activities, as well as new insights and dimensions that helped refine ICARDA's new Strategic Plan for 2007- 2016. The EPMR coincided with a transition in the governance and leadership of ICARDA. Against the backdrop of the EPMR recommendations, the staff, management and Board of Trustees took a fresh look at the Center's achievements and lessons learned since it was established.
Areas in need of strategic realignment were identified to reposition ICARDA to meet the emerging challenges driven by climate variability and change, population growth, globalization, and other factors in dry areas. The EPMR report highlighted the very positive feedback from ICARDA's stakeholders, commended the quality and relevance of the Center's research, the sound financial management, the strength of regional programs, the Center's strong relationships with NARS partners; and acknowledged that ICARDA activities have had significant impact on improving agricultural productivity and livelihoods in the dry areas. Implementation of the EPMR recommendations started in 2006.
During the year, ICARDA continued to make rapid strides in its research and training activities. The Center ranked ""Superior"" in the CGIAR Annual Performance Measurement for 2006, based on a set of performance indicators, and was highest among the 15 sister centers for its commitment to documenting impacts and building an impact assessment culture of its research.
Eighteen improved varieties of wheat, barley, chickpea, lentil, grass pea and faba bean, developed jointly by NARS-ICARDA teams from ICARDA-generated germplasm material, were released in 11 countries. Adoption of the varieties released earlier, and of improved technologies for water, land and livestock management, continued to increase and was documented through socioeconomic and impact studies. 
New, strategic partnerships were forged to increase ICARDA's efforts on crop diversification, particularly highvalue crops and value-added crop and livestock products. In this context, studies on characterization of indigenous small-ruminant breeds were published to help national researchers exploit the genetic potential of different breeds available in the region.
Work at the water benchmark sites, aimed at improving water-use efficiency, made substantial progress in bringing local communities, policy makers and national researchers together: the number of farmers using microcatchment water harvesting systems to capture rainfall in the steppe areas of Jordan has tripled; the terracedfurrows system, which uses 30% less water, gained popularity in the irrigated benchmark area in Egypt; and early sowing and supplemental irrigation attracted increased farmer attention in the rainfed benchmark area in Morocco. In order to leverage its international presence and encourage wider dissemination of the International Public Goods produced through its research, ICARDA scaled up its participation in various international conventions, particularly the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). ICARDA, together with ICRISAT, continued to lead the Oasis Consortium to combat desertification, working with nine other CGIAR Centers and a number of national governments, research centers and other partners. Among several initiatives of the Center to contribute to the ""International Year of Deserts,"" the most significant was an international conference, which ICARDA co-sponsored with the International Drylands Development Commission, Chinese Academy of Sciences, United Nations University, Tokyo, and other partners. The conference was held in Beijing, China, in February 2006. 
The Center continued to contribute to the rebuilding of agricultural research and human resources expertise in countries affected by war and conflict in the region, particularly Afghanistan, Iraq and the Palestinian Authority. Donor support for these efforts continued to be strong, enabling the Center and its partners to scale up their efforts, with great success in strengthening agricultural research capacity to support national economic development.
ICARDA is indebted to Dr Margaret Catley-Carlson and Prof. Dr Adel El-Beltagy, who held the office of the Board Chair and Director General, respectively, until 7 May 2006, for their vision and able governance and leadership of the Center. Their contributions to the growth and development of ICARDA are gratefully acknowledged. The achievements reported in this Annual Report would not have been possible without the generous support of a large number of donors to the Center (listed in Appendix 7). ICARDA is grateful to all of them.

included in spatially explicit models of land use change and other spatial analyses. Neighbourhood
indices, however, depend strongly on the spatial extent set for calculating them. So far, most of the
existing land-use change analyses or models using neighbourhood indices assumed some predefined
neighbourhood extents without proving whether the selected extents are optimal for the analysis of the
corresponding land use dynamics. This paper presents a methodological procedure to identify (i) the
optimal neighbourhood extent and (ii) the range of scale-dependency in neighbourhood effects of
different land use types and different types of land conversions. We applied this procedure in the canton
Valais of Switzerland, an inner Alpine mountainous region. The findings clearly show the differences in
optimal neighbourhood extent and the scale-dependency among conversion types. The procedure
introduced in this contribution can help to optimize the neighbourhood variables in spatially explicit landuse

"mel:20.500.11766/8141";"Desert land reclamation programs and family land dynamics in the Western Desert of the Nile Delta (Egypt), 1960–2010";"";"The agricultural development on newly reclaimed lands has led to many national debates about food
security and budget deficits, and the living conditions of the new settlers at the local level. This debate
is still crucial for present day Egypt, a country facing major challenges, including food security, agriculture
modernization, employment generation, and land fragmentation due to dramatic population growth.
In this context, policy makers are always seeking the best land allocation system for these new lands. This
paper analyzes the land tenure and land use dynamics of farmers’ settlements during a program of land
reclamation (from 1960 to 2010) in the Western Desert of the Nile Delta. The objective is to describe the
land development paths of farm settlement and to identify promising dynamics by cross-referencing the
farmers’ stories and their livelihood achievements. To accomplish that, we conducted household surveys
and interviews to learn the life stories’ of 175 family farms. Our study finds that, beyond the rules and
institutions that fixed the land tenure regimes and its distribution in these new lands, settlers have found
different ways to hold on and secure their land farm, even if the unequal land distribution still structure
the population. The results highlight also the dynamism of small-scale settlers, regarding livelihood
diversification, to face the challenges of these desert environments. In addition, the dual-purpose system
embedded in mixed crop-livestock systems can contribute to settlers’ livelihood security. These realities
confound the unchanged rhetoric of government and this calls for more social consideration of these new
rural spaces based on a combination of heterogeneous networks off relationships and knowledge. The
apparent gap between the macro- and micro-perspectives analyses also requires multi-scale assessments.
Finally, the life-story method proves to be a complementary and useful approach to integrate
the livelihood representation and dynamic.";"Alary, Veronique

"mel:20.500.11766/3493";"An economic valuation of sustainable land management through agroforestry in eastern Sudan_Assessing the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of land degradation";"";"Gedaref State was previously known as the
food basket of Sudan. Over several decades
unsustainable agricultural practices that
combined near-monocropping with low nutrient
replenishment have led to significant degradation
of soils, which are no longer able to sustain farmer
livelihoods. This study found that adopting
an integrated sustainable land use and forest
restoration scenario could reverse the current
land degradation trend. The integration of Acacia
senegal with sorghum, Sudan’s primary staple
crop, was evaluated as a potential sustainable land
management practice. A. senegal is a high quality
gum arabic producing tree species, traditionally
integrated into a crop and fallow system. It has soil
nitrogen enhancing properties and international
demand for its gum, make it a promising species
to integrate in agricultural systems for both
environmental and economic health. In parallel,
consideration was also given to reforesting hills
that have bare and exposed soil, with Luban
gum trees such as Boswellia catering, Boswellia
frererana, and Boswellia papyrifera. Currently these
hills are not used for productive gains and have
no competing land use, thus their reforestation
would incur little to no opportunity costs.
The valuation of both proposed integrated
sustainable land management and forest
restoration scenarios were undertaken using
an ex-ante cost benefit analysis. An assessment
of the ecosystem services and economic
impact of restoration scenarios was carried out
Executive summary
using valuation techniques which included a
productivity change approach, and replacement
and avoided damage cost approaches. The
analysis built on high-resolution remote sensing,
GIS, and biophysical soil and water assessment
tools, allowing for rigourous estimates of the
impact of land use change on agricultural yields,
groundwater infiltration, water runoff, and carbon
sequestration.
The results showed that the net present value
returns to society as well as to the individual
farmer of intercropping A. senegal trees with
sorghum crops is significantly higher than that
of continuing pure sorghum cultivation over a 25
year time horizon – the length of the productive
life of A. senegal. At the farmer level, benefits of
using an intercropping system outweigh the
investment and management costs between three
to four years after their establishment. However,
favourable estimates of the financial returns from
gum arabic offer no guarantee that the farmer
will undertake gum production (Barbier 2000).
This decision will depend on what returns can be
obtained from other crops and the time profile
of these returns, as argued in Barbier (1992).
Thus, there are a number of fundamental policy
initiatives necessary to encourage farmers to
transition towards integrating A. senegal as part of
a sustainable land management system, including
security of tenure and access to credit, as well as
maintenance of the actual producer price for gum
arabic in the long term.";"Hodel, Elias

It is usually found with several erect culms, grows up to 1.5 m in height, and forms substantial tufts. It is a tall stiff glabrous grass with pungent leaves, and a C4 grass with sclerophyllous, spine-tipped, inrolled leaves, with sunken stomata. The root system extends laterally for a radius of 20 m or more. The roots are covered throughout their length by a sandy sheath, which is penetrated by the root hairs that occur throughout the entire length of the sheath. The piliferous layer of the root cap acts as a mucilage-secreting gland, the action of the mucilage easing the passage of the root tip through the grains of sand. The mucilage has high absorptive properties, concentrating any soil moisture around the sheath, from which it may be taken up by the root hairs.";"Gamoun, Mouldi

 respective states. The project interventions have piloted science-led farmer-centric integrated watershed
 management for enhancing natural resource use efficiency for crop production. Based on the various
 interventions for improved management of land, water and crops, the consortium team identified the
 success stories from different districts covering various activities such as balanced nutrient management,
 farmer participatory selection of improved varieties, enhancing water-use efficiency, using improved
 landform treatments, minimizing rainy season fallows, income-generating activities like goat rearing,
 vermicomposting and improved livestock breed rearing including vegetable farming which can be shared
 with other areas for benefiting the farmers. This compendium of success stories is based on the detailed
 interviews with the farmers, collecting required information through targeted visits and interacting with the
 community in the districts, their capacity enhancement and the continuity of the technology. The analysis
 is based on factual data from the users and other views.
 The success stories clearly revealed that crop productivity significantly improved with improved
 management and also resulted in increased family incomes through use of intensification of the systems
 with balanced nutrient management, water management, improved seeds of high-yielding short-duration
 cultivars and crop diversification; microenterprises benefiting women, self-help groups and individuals also
 enhanced the family incomes and empowered women in the project areas. This compendium comprises

"mel:20.500.11766/5933";"The role of governance in sustainable rangeland management";"";"The  management and  rehabilitation of  degraded rangelands  are inherently complex  in south 
Mediterranean where state and tribal owned pastures are grazed commonly by the agro-pastoralists. The 
prospect for increased degradation primarily caused by overgrazing and recurrent droughts is currently at 
alarming  levels.  Reversing  the  negative  trends  primarily  requires  insightful  management  practices, 
institutional and policy support, and ultimately sound governance. Historically, the emphasis on rangeland 
management and improvement has been placed on the agronomic and ecological techniques but the efforts 
to  restore  the  health  and  biodiversity  of  rangelands  have achieved  little  impact.  Low  adoption of  the 
technical and agronomic packages indicates that the imperative role of the governance and well-established 
sustainable communal land management cannot be ignored. Governance practices that are in conformity 
with socio-organizational arrangements are essential for sustainable management in particular for common 
rangeland grazing regimes. These practices should be set up in a participatory manner, involving the agro-
pastoralists and building social networking to achieve environmental, social and economic sustainability in 
agropastoral production systems. This brief paper aims to highlight the role of governance of rangelands in 
sustainable pastoralism in the south Mediterranean region.";"Ates, Serkan

There are hundreds of options that can improve the sustainability of land management and prevent or reverse degradation, but there are almost as many socio-cultural, institutional and policy barriers preventing their adoption at scale. To tackle this challenge, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research’s Dryland Systems Program and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification convened an expert group to consider barriers and incentives to scaling up sustainable land management (SLM) and land restoration practices, as part of the first Global Land Outlook. The group reviewed existing frameworks for scaling up relevant interventions across a range of contexts, and identified eight critical success factors: i) adaptively plan; ii) consistently fund; iii) select SLM options for scaling up based on best available evidence; iv) identify and engage with stakeholders at all scales; v) build capacity for scaling up; vi) foster institutional leadership and policy change to support scaling up; vii) achieve early tangible benefits and incentives for as many stakeholders as possible and viii) monitor, evaluate and communicate. Incentives for scaling up were identified for the private sector, farmers and their communities and policy makers. Based on these findings a new framework for scaling up is presented that analyses the contexts in which there is evidence that specific SLM interventions can be scaled up and out, so that scalable SLM options can be screened and adapted to these contexts, piloted and disseminated. This will then help countries achieve land degradation neutrality and comply with the Sustainable Development Goal 15, “Life on Land”.";"Thomas, Richard

Intercropping groundnut and pigeonpea using the correct spatial arrangement increase land productivity, provides more types of food and profits while conserving and sustaining the environment through enhancement of soil fertility. Pigeonpea is suitable for intercropping with groundnut because of its slow growth in the first two months and only starts rapid growth when groundnut approaches maturity. Double up legumes leads to biomass production of between 2.3 to 3.5 t ha-1 compared with 1 – 2 t ha-1 when groundnut is grown in pure stand. The system leads to groundnut equivalent grain yield of 1.3 t ha-1 compared with 0.8 t ha-1 when groundnut is grown in pure stand. Short duration groundnut variety in intercrops with medium duration pigeonpea variety gave 520 kg ha-1 more grain yield than intercropping the same groundnut variety with short duration pigeonpea variety. Land equivalent ratios (LERs) of all intercrop combinations were greater than unity indicating more efficient and productive use of environmental resources by intercrops. Economic returns and benefit-cost ratios were greater for intercrops than either sole crop. This suggests that careful selection of varieties in intercrops with different architecture and growth habits are complementary and contribute to the sustainable utilization of limited land resources that enhance resource use efficiency, yield and economic returns.";"Ngwira, Amos";"";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2018-12-15";"en";"land;research";"";"014;MWI";"Institutional & Promotional Materials";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/9406";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/93acdd15386a67afb318168a561509d3";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/93acdd15386a67afb318168a561509d3/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

In all plots, total plant cover, species richness and grass density where determined in spring 2008. Results showed that despite the negative effect of drought, considerable and positive effects of protection and at lesser degree of reseeding on all scored parameters. This is an indication that when degradation is still reversible, restoration techniques are more effective in addition to their low costs. However, the good establishment of S. pungens seedlings may encourage the recourse to the rehabilitation technique by reintroducing some promoting native Saharan species when ecosystems loose their resilience capacities.";"Ben Abdellatif, M.

This event will focus on the innovative Research in Development approach that embeds research within development programmes by constructing co-learning cycles amongst partners in order to boost and sustain impact. The speakers will give examples of farmer-led land restoration innovations scaled through the Research in Development approach across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia as key pathways to addressing the severe land degradation that affects the livelihoods of some of the world’s most vulnerable people – those living in the drylands. It will highlight how transformative outcomes can be achieved by placing farmers and communities at the center of land restoration efforts and connecting these to livelihood options.";"Whitbread, Anthony

This research was started in the last quarter of 2016 as a response to the perceived need to launch interdisciplinary research to identify approaches to enhance the effectiveness of the on-going efforts to mitigate land degradation in Badia and to restore rangeland productivity. The goal of this specific activity is to evaluate methods to enable an evaluation of the impacts of the interventions conducted so far.
This report summarizes the results of the data gathering work done during 2017 to elaborate a comprehensive dataset on the SWC and WH structures implemented in the Badia rangelands, as part of Activity A6. The data collected and illustrated here come from both institutional sources (data provided by governmental institutions) and from our own analysis of open access satellite images.

Most of the research works on adaptive animal traits have focused on sheep and goats in non-irrigated areas, with little interest in livestock systems in irrigated areas. However, meat and dairy products in Egypt are mainly sup- plied by large ruminants − cattle and buffaloes. In addition, research on genetic improvement to increase production has neglected local cattle breeds such as the Baladi, which appears to be endangered. Based on individual and collec- tive interviews conducted in two governorates of Egypt, this study aimed to des- cribe the situation of this local breed based on the perceptions and practices of the actors in the sector (including farmers, traders and service suppliers), and to draw perspectives for its future. From the interviews, the Baladi appeared adap- ted and more resistant to harsh conditions, especially to extreme warm tempe- ratures, feed shortage periods, and some diseases, in particular foot-and-mouth disease. However, there is no organization or collective action to preserve or promote this breed because of its low level of dairy production, although its meat is highly valued in rural areas and could be the source of a potential niche market.";"Osman, Mona Abd El-Zaher

Food security and rural welfare in these areas are limited by a range of factors, biophysical, socio-economic and policy-related. And many of the biggest challenges – poverty, drought, land degradation, food insecurity – will be exacerbated by climate change.
Nevertheless, dry areas hold the key to Africa’s food security – which is why ICARDA’s research focuses on dryland agriculture. ICARDA has worked in Africa for over 30 years.

ICARDA’s mission is to enhance food, water, and nutritional security and environmental health in the face of global challenges, including climate change. Through preparedness for change and productivity gains in the rural economy, ICARDA will contribute to poverty reduction and social stability as our overarching goal. Innovative science, partnerships for impact, capacity development, and a fit-for-purpose organization are our tools.
Our Strategic Plan aligns with the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework and eight of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 1, No Poverty; Goal 2, Zero Hunger; Goal 3, Good Health; Goal 5, Gender Equality; Goal 6, Clean Water and Sanitation; Goal 13, Climate Action; Goal 15, Life on Land; and Goal 17, Partnerships for the Goals. It addresses the significant challenges facing the world’s non-tropical dry areas: rising temperatures, critical water scarcity, fragile natural resources, and an insecure food and nutritional future under often-unstable social conditions.
We have listened to our partners in the national agricultural research systems, and we will take the experience of years of consultations and cooperation forward into the next decade. Our staff have been invaluable in this process, along with our sister CGIAR centers and other partners. We are confident that the Strategic Research Priorities we have identified build on the knowledge and strengths of ICARDA and our partners and will produce the greatest impact, leaving an enduring legacy that will help rural communities in dry areas to weather future shocks, especially the impacts of climate change. 
To ensure that ICARDA’s research generates evidence-based science, technological innovation, policy dialogue, and knowledge sharing, thereby improving policies, practices, and livelihoods for rural communities and supporting agricultural transformation for future generations that harnesses the enormous potential of dry areas, we will abide by our core values of integrity and high ethical standards and hold ourselves accountable for our actions. 
ICARDA’s Strategic Plan is a living, dynamic, and evolving partnership approach that can proactively adapt to the constantly changing environment and the needs and priorities of rural communities. ICARDA will continue to adapt and evolve, responding nimbly to changes in the development landscape and the challenges faced in the regions where ICARDA works.";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2017-10-31";"en";"climate change;youth";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"014;015;030;034;143;145;AFG;CHN;DZA;EGY;ETH;IND;IRN;IRQ;JOR;KAZ;KGZ;LBN;LBY;MAR;PAK;PSE;SDN;SYR;TJK;TKM;TUN;TUR;UZB";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8237";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/5fae7a79813a3b4efcc018f070943bb4";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/5fae7a79813a3b4efcc018f070943bb4/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

a need for viable alternatives to fallow and cereal mono-cropping systems common in dry areas of this region. The
sustainability and economic viability of such rotations can only be assessed accurately by using long-term trials.Atwo-course
rotation experiment was established in 1986 in north-eastern Syria, comparing yields and profitability of wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.) when grown after wheat, fallow, a grazed mixture of medic species (Medicago spp.) and common vetch (Vicia
sativa L.) cut for hay, over 10 growing seasons. Lentils (Lens culinaris Medik.) were introduced into the experiment in 1990.
On average over the course of the experiment, the highest wheat grain yields were obtained following fallow (2.57 t ha–1), the
lowest in continuous wheat (1.14 t ha–1), and intermediate following medic and vetch (1.90–2.01 t ha–1). Compared with
wheat grown after fallow, wheat grain yields declined following vetch, medic and lentils in only three of the 10 seasons, which
were drier than average. Yields of wheat after lentils were generally lower (2.22 t ha–1) than after vetch (mean 2.56 t ha–1) and
after medic (2.40 t ha–1). Inclusion of grain legumes in the rotations boosted profits considerably because of their high grain
prices and valuable straw. Replacing fallow with vetch for hay production increased the average gross margin by
US$126 ha–1 year–1, and growing vetch for hay in rotation with wheat produced greater profit than continuous wheat,
by $254 ha–1 year–1. The wheat–vetch-for-grain and wheat–lentil rotations were especially profitable, at least twice as
profitable as wheat–fallow and three times continuous wheat. This experiment adds to the growing body of field data in Syria
and in Australia showing that forage and grain legumes are excellent alternatives to wheat–fallow rotation and continuous
wheat production in areas that experience a Mediterranean-type climate, and help support more efficient and sustainable
cropping systems.";"Christiansen, Scott

"mel:20.500.11766/9043";"Application of systematic monitoring and mapping techniques: Assessing land restoration potential in semi-arid lands of Kenya";"";"Drylands cover over 40% of the earth's surface and support over 2 billion people, globally (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). In East Africa alone, over 250 million people depend on drylands for their livelihoods (De Leeuw et al., 2014) and in Kenya, 70% of the total land area is classiﬁed as arid- and semi-arid (Batjes, 2004). Over the last several decades, an increasing and more sedentary human population has resulted in more pressure on these lands, and an expansion of agricultural production into marginal dryland areas that were traditionally rangelands. The result is widespread soil loss and land degradation, as well as increased pressure on protected areas and more frequent human-wildlife conﬂict in Kenya (Laikipia Wildlife Forum, 2012;Nyamwamu,2016).Thesefactors,combinedwithclimate change and erratic rainfall, continue to increase the vulnerability ofdrylands in East Africa (Darkoh, 1998). However, drylands are also considered to have an important role in mitigating climate change (Lal, 2004; Neely et al., 2009; Neely and De Leeuw, 2008), are important biodiversity hot-spots and support a diversity of livelihoods (Mortimore, 2009). While land degradation is recognized as a major cause of low agricultural and rangeland productivity, estimates of land degradation within the drylands remain poor and hence also vary widely. For example, the (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) estimated that between10%and70%ofglobaldrylands aredegraded.Theapplication of remote sensing, coupled with systematic ﬁeld assessments, for monitoring, assessing and mapping land degradation patterns and severity within landscapes has the potential to signiﬁcantly improve current estimates of land degradation, while at the same time allowing for spatially explicit targeting of restoration options and monitoring of change over time. Such advances will also ultimately make assessments of the drivers of land degradation in drylands possible, which is critical for successful restoration and for avoiding further degradation.";"Winowiecki, Leigh

"mel:20.500.11766/8849";"Semi-Detailed Soil Surveys of Merek and Honam Watersheds, Karkheh River Basin, Iran";"";"The study of soils is important for landuse planning, agriculture, and natural resource development programs. Determination of soil characteristics and limitations is one of the most important duties of soil researchers. This report presents a semi-detailed soil survey of Merek watershed in Kermanshah Province, and Honam watershed in Lorestan Province, Iran. It is hoped that the analyses and recommendations will be of value to those interested in the optimum use of Iran’s land and water resources. 
The Merek watershed is located southeast of Kermanshah, the provincial capital, and has an area of 24,200 ha. Its climate is cold semi-arid, and soil temperature and moisture regimes are thermic and xeric, respectively. Lithological composition is mainly limestone, dolomite, marl, claystone and sandstone. 
The Honam watershed is located south of Alashtar city and has an area of 14,200 ha. The area’s high mountains contribute to a wet climate, and soil temperature and moisture regimes are mesic and xeric, respectively. Lithological composition comprises limestone, dolomite, marl, quartzite, shale, sandstone, and conglomerate.
Interpretive map units were produced for both watersheds using a geo-pedologic approach. The soil morphology, physical, and chemical characteristics determined in each map unit were: color, soil structure, rock fragments, voids, roots, clay cutans, soil reaction, soil salinity, soil alkalinity, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, soil texture, field capacity, and permanent wilting point. 
In Merek, three landscapes, seven reliefs or moldings, and 21 land units were distinguished. Three soil orders were identified: Entisols, Inceptisols and Vertisols, with Entisols found in the mountains and hilly areas. Soil textures in the profiles are clay or silt clay. A subangular blocky structure is the dominant soil structure. The amount of subsurface gravel (fine and coarse) in the profiles dug on mountains and hilly areas varies between 25% and 60%. The pH varies between 7.3 and 7.9, electrical conductivity varies between 0.4 and 0.8 ds m-1, organic carbon varies between 1% and 3%, and the amount of CaCO3 in surface horizons varies between 17% and 32%. 
In Honam, four landscapes, 10 reliefs or moldings, and 37 land units were distinguished. Two soil orders were identified: Entisols and Inceptisols, with Entisols found in the mountains and hilly areas and Inceptisols in the piedmonts and valleys. Textures in the soil profiles are clay or silty clay and the dominant soil structure is subangular blocky. The amount of subsurface gravel (fine and coarse) in the profiles dug on mountains and hilly areas varies between 0% and more than 75%. The pH varies between 7.3 and 8.0, electrical conductivity varies between 0.2 and 7.6 ds m-1, organic carbon varies between 1% and 3.7%, and the amount of CaCO3 in surface horizons varies between 1.7% and 43.42%. Topography, soil depth, stoniness, water erosion, and heavy soil texture (especially in the surface horizons) are the main limiting factors in the study area.";"Milani, P. Mohajer

"mel:20.500.11766/4562";"Multifaceted Impacts of Sustainable Land Management in Drylands: A Review";"";"Biophysical restoration or rehabilitation measures of land have demonstrated to be effective
in many scientific projects and small-scale environmental experiments. However circumstances such
as poverty, weak policies, or inefficient scientific knowledge transmission can hinder the effective
upscaling of land restoration and the long term maintenance of proven sustainable use of soil and
water. This may be especially worrisome in lands with harsh environmental conditions. This review
covers recent efforts in landscape restoration and rehabilitation with a functional perspective aiming
to simultaneously achieve ecosystem sustainability, economic efficiency, and social wellbeing. Water
management and rehabilitation of ecosystem services in croplands, rangelands, forests, and coastlands
are reviewed. The joint analysis of such diverse ecosystems provides a wide perspective to determine:
(i) multifaceted impacts on biophysical and socio-economic factors; and (ii) elements influencing
effective upscaling of sustainable land management practices. One conclusion can be highlighted: voluntary adoption is based on different pillars, i.e. external material and economic support, and
spread of success information at the local scale to demonstrate the multidimensional benefits of
sustainable land management. For the successful upscaling of land management, more attention
must be paid to the social system from the first involvement stage, up to the long term maintenance.";"Marques, Maria Jose

model setup was done using Arc SWAT interface for each sub-catchment independently.
SWAT Manual Calibration helper tool was used for calibration of the model parameters
using time series (monthly) sediment load data from 2009-2010 and then validation of
simulated sediment yield was done for the year 2011 for each sub-catchment separately.
The performance of the model was evaluated using statistical and graphical methods to
assess the capability of the model in simulating the sediment yield for the study area.
The correlation coefficient value was 0.78 between simulated and observed sediment

The Karkheh River Basin (KRB) is an important agricultural zone, located in the southwest of Iran where two major agricultural production systems prevail, a rainfed system upstream of the newly built Karkheh dam, and a fully irrigated system downstream of the dam. The quality of the river water is good (electrical conductivity (EC) ranging between 0.9 dS/m and 1.7 dS/m, depending on the different seasons and locations along the river). The area is suitable for a wide range of crops, such as wheat, maize, alfalfa, and off-season vegetable crops. The agricultural water resources of the KRB consist of both surface and groundwater. Given the high potential of agricultural land and the possibility of using high quality water from the dams; the rationalization of these areas could have signi cant effects on the economy of the region and the country. The average irrigation ef ciency (the ratio of amount of water used for evapotranspiration to the amount of water diverted from the reservoir) in the lower KRB is 30% and average WP is 0.5 kg/m3 – lower than the country averages of 37% and 0.8 kg/m3 (Keshavarz et al., 2005). 
Based on the results of this two-year study, the average irrigation and rain WP, water application ef ciency (WAE) and maize crop water productivity (CWP) were 0.38 kg/ m3, 38.6 % and 1.01 kg/m3, respectively. Several practices were examined to improve maize water productivity. Inside-furrow planting (T5) had less water losses compared to the common planting and irrigation method (T1) thus, having a grain yield higher than (T1). It was also found that by the application of a planting and irrigation management method according to (T5), it is possible to reduce water consumption by up to 31%. The (T5) method also caused a signi cant increase in IWP and CWP compared to (T1). In the range of moisture stress of this study, by providing 75 percent of the crop water requirement, the predicted IWP will be 1.3 kg/m3 of water consumed by the plant. Variable alternate furrow irrigation method cannot be recommended due to high irrigation water consumption resulting from water in ux from wet furrows into the neighboring dry furrows. Double row planting on 75 cm ridges (T3) had higher dry matter, grain yield, and IWP compared to the farmers’ practice (T1), but had less IWP than (T5). According to this study, proper surface irrigation management methods and furrow planting could increase irrigation water productivity (IWP) to values 45% higher than the prevailing farmers’ practice i.e. the control treatment.  In addition, using drip irrigation increased irrigation water productivity (IWP) by three fold.
The observations in the study indicate that the factors behind low WP include: 1) poor farmer knowledge of irrigation management, 2) bad crop management practices, 3) plant nutrient de ciency, 4) high water and soil salinity, 5) large wetland areas, and 6) poor functioning of drainage systems. However, researchers who conducted the study clari ed that by improving research, as well as farm and irrigation management skills, the average irrigation WP for wheat in the studied area would increase from 0.84 kg/m3 to 1.1 kg/m3.
The study concludes with recommendations like replacing current corn varieties in the region with high-yielding ones, planting corn seeds at the bottom of the furrows to give a 20% to 30% decrease in the amount of irrigation water consumed, planting at the bottom of the furrows to reduce the amount of irrigation water consumed and to increase irrigation water productivity.";"Moayeri, Mansour

the poor in the drylands. Opuntiaficus-indica (L.) Mill. is a xerophytic cactus species, widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions
worldwide. As most of species of the Cactacee family, 0. fiCUS-indica exhibits Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), with
nocturnal stomata opening and C02 uptake occurring, typically, from dusk to dawn. Many reasons may account for the great interest
devoted to cacti. The multipurpose use of this plant species and their ability to grow in harsh environments are the main reasons.
Their root characteristics ameliorate wind and rain eroded soils so their growth in degraded areas should be encouraged. The
establishment of sustainable production systems based on cactus may contribute to the food security of populations in agriculturally
marginalized areas and to soil improvement. Cacti are some of the best plants for the revegetation of arid and semi-arid areas because
they are tolerant of scarce and erratic rainfall and high temperatures. The reasons behind the inclusion of cacti include (i) simple
cultivation practices required to grow the crop, (ii) its quick establishment soon after the introduction in a new area, (iii) ability to grow
in harsh conditions characterized by high temperature, lack of water and poor soil, (iv) generation of income from the selling of much
valued and appreciated fruits, (v) use of its stems in the human diet and as fodder for livestock and (vi) many industrial derivatives are
produced from the fruits.";"Nefzaoui, Ali

The third report in the Assessment proposes investment options and methods to analyze the investment options to manage and remediate salinity in Iraq. 
This report has been compiled from project contributions from a number of authors across all of its seven technical Components. 
The Iraq Salinity Assessment synthesizes the results of the Iraq Salinity Project, a research partnership between five Iraqi ministries and national agencies and an international team of researchers, led by ICARDA, specialized in land and water management, crop improvement and plant breeding, and socio-economics. 
This research builds on previous work and technical studies done in Iraq and on the expertise of Iraqi agencies working to promote agricultural development over the past decades. It provides solutions based on the analysis of historical data and new data compiled in the Iraq Salinity Project and provides methods of implementation to reduce salinity, or reduce the impact of salinity on agriculture and environment in Iraq. 
The Assessment benefits from Australia's experience in dealing with similar salinity problems in its agricultural sector. The salinity situation and agro-hydrological problems faced by Iraq are similar to those faced in Australia's Murray-Darling river basin. Australia has tackled its salinity problem in a systematic way since the 1980's and today salinity is being controlled and reversed in many areas. 
The solutions and implementations presented in this report are a synthesis of a body of research – field-level and technical studies in Southern and Central Iraq, a new body of data and information collected and compiled by the research team and a series of technical and background papers.

Existing global databases of species’ threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses.

More than 50% of South Asia’s dryland ecosystems are located in India. Drylands contribute about 40% of the total food grain production and support two thirds of livestock population. Despite these important roles, agricultural production systems in the drylands are facing numerous challenges that threaten their resilience and future sustainability. This paper demonstrates some of the challenges and draws implications for priorities research and strategies. As an example, we selected districts representing different dryland agricultural production systems in western Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states of India. First we focus on the present performance of the major agricultural production systems by highlighting their structure (e.g. farm size) and key indicators of their function and state (e.g. production). We discuss major problems in terms of their cause and effect on these systems’ structure and function. Finally we synthesize lessons as to where system research should focus and what strategies are needed to produce a more resilient and dryland sustainable agricultural production system in in the future.";"Haileslassie, Amare

useful for supporting decisions about what and where to invest for the best overall environmental and
developmental outcomes. The task faces a great challenge due to the inherent complexity of humanlandscape
systems and trade-offs between rural livelihood improvement, biodiversity conservation and
carbon sequestration. Agent-based system models have been recognized to be well suited to simulate
the co-evolutions of the community and landscape systems in response to policy interventions. The
study applies the Land Use Dynamics Simulator (LUDAS) framework to a mountain watershed in
central Vietnam for anticipating trade-offs among rural livelihoods, forest biodiversity and carbon
stocks under different land-use policy interventions. Changes in plant species diversity driven by land
cover change were calculated using the species-area relationships that were estimated based on
vegetation surveys. Total species pool of the study area was calculated with a taking into account of
species' turning over different vegetation cover types. Carbon stocks of different forest types were
estimated by empirical allometric equations. Our purpose is to assess relative impacts of policy
interventions by measuring the long-term landscape and community divergences (compared with a

"mel:20.500.11766/4966";"Economics of Land Degradation Initiative: Report for the Private Sector";"";"With around one third of the world’s arable land
degraded, estimated annual losses of 6.3 to 10.6
USD trillion, and a projected need to increase food
production from land by 70 per cent by 2050, we
simply cannot afford to neglect the loss of potential
production from careless land management.
Whenever land is not producing at its potential,
it is an under-performing asset that requires
investments to ensure the future supply chains
that many industries depend upon.
Sustainable land management and landscapes
are now beginning to be recognised as central
to the achievement of the global agendas such
as the Sustainable Development Goals, and the
UN climate, biodiversity, and desertification
conventions. This shift in the political landscape
creates substantial rewards for businesses that
invest in sustainable land management in their
value chains. Expected returns on investment
are high for more at-risk sectors, including food
and beverages, construction, utilities, mining,
renewable biomass energy, clean and reliable
water supplies, etc. At the same time, investments
create ‘shared value’ that equitably benefit all
involved in land management. With up to 2 billion
hectares suitable for restoration/rehabilitation, a
reversal of land degrading trends will contribute
to multiple benefits while helping to address the
great challenges of climate change, biodiversity
loss, alleviation of poverty, and hunger.
In this report, the Economics of Land Degradation
(ELD) Initiative outlines opportunities and benefits
for the private sector in directly and indirectly
investing in sustainable land management. These
come through improved yields of goods like food,
fibre, and timber, new business opportunities and
novel markets, and creating and ensuring social
“licences to operate”. It builds on the previous
report on the assessment of business exposure to
land degradation risk from 2013.
Pathways are outlined where large, medium, and
small companies can position themselves to take
advantage of potential benefits, including; 1) new
products and markets that are resource-use efficient
and are suited to restoration and rehabilitation
sites; and, 2) improvements in existing markets
by increasing production and adding value. Many
companies are already recognising the need
for greater environmental accountability and
gain competitive advantages by doing do. The
report further discusses barriers and incentives
and ways to manage them. Emphasis is given to
striking up new partnerships with civil society
and governments that are profitable, distribute
benefits to all stakeholders, assure maintenance
of valued ecosystem services, and ensure enabling
environments for investment and implementation
that pose no threats to any participant.
The challenges of sustainable land management
are great, but we believe that the required market
transformation strategies will be better informed
by the work of the ELD initiative through this
publication, and the continued support of the
private sector by the ELD in transitioning to
sustainable land management practices and the
resulting benefits and rewards.";"Cornell, Akima

Water shortage in arid zones limits the variety and quantity of crop and livestock products a smallholder can produce, thus narrowing their range of options. Furthermore, poor smallholder producers seldom use productivity-enhancing inputs, such as improved seed varieties and fertilizers, due to high risks associated with variability of water available for plant growth. This, together with the fluctuations in yields, makes it hard for poor farmers to participate in emerging market economies.";"Akroush, Samia

considered paramount. As the demand for agricultural products multiplies, other ecosystem services
are being degraded or lost entirely. Finding a sustainable trade-off between food production and
one or more of other ecosystem services, given the variety of stakeholders, is a matter of optimizing
land use in a dynamic and complex socio-ecological system. Land degradation reduces our options
to meet both food demands and environmental needs. In order to illustrate this trade-off dilemma,
four representative services, carbon sinks, water storage, biodiversity, and space for urbanization,
are discussed here based on a review of contemporary literature that cuts across the domain of
ecosystem services that are provided by land. Agricultural research will have to expand its focus from
the field to the landscape level and in the process examine the cost of production that internalizes
environmental costs. In some situations, the public cost of agriculture in marginal environments
outweighs the private gains, even with the best technologies in place. Land use and city planners will
increasingly have to address the cost of occupying productive agricultural land or the conversion
of natural habitats. Landscape designs and urban planning should aim for the preservation of
agricultural land and the integrated management of land resources by closing water and nutrient
cycles, and by restoring biodiversity.";"Vlek, Paul

"mel:20.500.11766/10391";"Developing a toolbox for rangeland restoration/rehabilitation in arid environments";"";"Rangelands are recognized for their importance and value in providing society with valuable products and ecosystem services. In such ecosystems, effective management is needed for sustainable plant growth and survival in a context characterized by rainfall unreliability, poor soil nutrient status and high uncontrolled grazing. Therefore, cost-effective techniques/tools for slowing down and eventually reversing this degradation are needed. This paper promotes identifying and combining various tools for degraded arid ecosystems as strategies aimed for rangeland restoration/ rehabilitation. These strategies are founded on science-based evidence and experienced practitioners. For arid rangelands, the preference of applying an isolated rehabilitation technology may not halt degradation since the heterogeneity of the geomorphology, even at micro scale, and the landscape requires very often the use of different tools. For instance, direct seeding in degraded rangelands needs to be combined with soil scarification, when the crust dominates the soil surface, to reactivate the soil water retention and increase seedling emergence and germination possibilities. To achieve this goal, rehabilitation options identified for a specific degraded rangeland need to be holistically integrated with land degradation indicators in a manual-style decision support system for the long-term sustainable production of rangelands in arid environments.";"Louhaichi, Mounir

However, there is a dearth of baseline data that impede the design of site-appropriate recommended management practices (RMPs) to improve and sustain SOC accrual. In this study, the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF), a nested hierarchical sampling design was used to assess SOC and its spatial variability across the semi-arid zones of Ghana (Lambussie), Burkina Faso (Bondigui) and Mali (Finkolo). Soil samples were collected from three sites of 100 km2 stratified into 16 clusters and 160 plots and thereafter soil parameters were then analyzed using MIR spectroscopy. Regardless of soil strata, SOC storage with 95 % confidence level in semi-arid landscapes potentially ranged between 112 200 ± 14 000 and 253 000 ± 34 000 Mg C corresponding to 411 400 ± 51 333 Mg CO2-eq and 927 666.7 ± 124 666.7 Mg CO2-eq in the entire study area. On the other hand, investigation on the potential of climate change mitigation through SOC revealed contrasted figures as accumulation rates in cultivated lands ranged from 0.04 to 0.18 MgC ha−1 yr−1 and are balanced by higher depletion rates of −0.004 to −0.73 Mg ha−1 yr−1. This indicates the potential of semi-arid soils to store carbon through improved land management practices. Landscape study structured in cluster-level analysis revealed heterogeneity in the distribution of SOC stocks, a mandatory finer level analysis prior to effective decision-making about RMPs.";"Tondoh, Jerome

"mel:20.500.11766/9487";"Managing Salinity in Iraq's Agriculture: Current State, Causes, and Impacts";"";"This report is the first in a series of publications that comprise the Iraq Salinity Assessment.
This report documents the current state, causes, impacts of salinity in central and southern
Iraq. Other reports in the Assessment propose solutions and investment options to
manage and remediate salinity in Iraq.
The Iraq Salinity Assessment synthesizes the results or the Iraq Salinity Project, a research
partnership between five Iraqi ministries and national agencies and an international team
of researchers, led by ICARDA, specialized in land and water management, crop
improvement and plant breeding, and socioeconomics.
This research builds on previous work and technical studies done in Iraq and on the
expertise of Iraqi agencies working to promote agricultural development over the past
decades. It provides analysis of historical data and new data compiled in the Iraq Salinity
Project and provides an insight into the extent and severity of soil and water salinity in
Iraq.
The Assessment benefits from Australia’s experience in dealing with similar salinity
problems in its agricultural sector. The salinity situation and agro-hydrological problems
faced by Iraq are similar to those faced in Australia’s Murray-Darling river basin. Australia
has tackled its salinity problem in a systematic way since the 1980s, and today salinity is
being controlled and reversed in many areas.
This report is a synthesis and analysis of a body of research - field-level and technical
studies in North and Central Iraq, a new body of data and information collected and
compiled by the research team and a series of technical and background papers.";"Christen, Evan

Reseeding is the process by which rangelands are rehabilitated and it has two purposes; to ‘repair’ the degenerated rangeland system, and to increase the forage available for grazing animals. It involves sowing seeds directly into their final growing position, and is applied on rangelands with an advanced degree of degradation, low plant density or poor productivity levels. Reseeding is beneficial as it reduces the high costs associated with raising seedlings from nurseries and transplanting them to fields. If properly implemented, this technique is particularly effective for rehabilitating steep slopes, or otherwise inaccessible areas. Reseeding reduces root deformities caused by seedlings outgrowing their containers or careless transplanting techniques. It can potentially yield high plant density at low costs, and may also be an inexpensive means of providing wildlife habitats through a more diverse plant mixture which includes naturally regenerated plant species.";"Louhaichi, Mounir";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2017-05-29";"en";"land degradation";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7817";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/prGA12o5";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/prGA12o5/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

The presentations at the workshop focused on integrated and participatory approach to technology development in addressing water productivity and livelihood resilience. It underscored the importance of sustainable development without endangering the ecological assets of fragile ecosystems in this region. 
The workshop concluded, based on the research results presented and the discussions held, that agricultural water management occupies an important role in the efforts to improve the livelihoods of rural communities in the basin. It is also clear that achieving the objective of improving water productivity will positively affect farmers’ production and income and contribute to sustainable agriculture in the basin. There is a great potential for increasing water productivity in agriculture and the farmers resilience in the future as water will become more scarce and climate change is expected to aggravate that with prolonged drought and other extreme events.";"Farahani, Hamid

"mel:20.500.11766/3265";"Sustainable Intensification of Silvopasture Systems & Assessing Adaptability and Utilization Potential of Opuntia ficus-indica in Low Rainfall Regions of India Projects. Technical Reports";"";"India holds a substantial rangeland area, most of which is in the state of Rajasthan. The livestock sector is vital for the rural poor in the region and it is the main source of income. Advanced degradation of rangelands due to lack of proper management tools and the communal land tenure regime are leading to an increasing threat of desertification. Lack of adequate nutrition (due to overgrazed community rangelands), inappropriate management practices and restricted access to health services are the major causes of low productivity of small ruminants. Very little attention has been given to dryland areas for research on feeding and management of small ruminants for effective economic rearing.
Interventions that focus on community rangelands and feed and fodder issues could have pro-poor effects because small ruminants’ keepers are heavily dependent on natural resources for grazing and watering their animals. However, these resources are declining in condition and increasingly subject to access restrictions. A critical understanding of and need for evolving appropriate management systems to improve the productivity of small ruminants is imminent for drylands.
Under the umbrella of the ICAR-ICARDA collaborative research program several new projects were approved for the period 2014-2017. Among them two projects related to community based rangeland management and utilization potential of cactus pear (Opuntia ficus indica) in low rainfall regions of India by reducing the feed gap and scarcity that many livestock farmers are facing. The main purpose of these projects is to improve the livelihood of small holder farmers in the drylands of India improve fodder availability and. Such an effort has the possibility to reduce poverty and increase food security. Adequate nutrition and management practices are some of the leading causes for low livestock productivity. The diversification of crops aims to improve animal nutrition. The project also teaches sound management practices. Both the promotion of Opuntia ficus indica and sustainable silvopasture practices show promise in project sites. The annual report will review the current progress to date for these efforts. As the MOA was signed on the last day of 2014 (Appendix 1), the report reflects activities that took place since then.";"Louhaichi, Mounir

"mel:20.500.11766/8436";"Systems approach to water productivity assessment using cropping system Models";"";"Irrigation management of crops in Egypt is characterized by the application of more water than the crops require. In fact, large amounts of water are supplied without any estimates of the soil water content at the root zone. The rationale for doing so is the assumption that more irrigation water means a greater yield. So, eliminating the use of this unnecessary irrigation water could help save the resource, provided that this can be done with low yield losses.
The estimation of soil water reserves in the root zone area is essential for the best irrigation management. This management can be done by modeling water depletion from the root zone under the application of different amounts of irrigation water (Khalil et al., 2007). Models that simulate crop growth and water flow in the root zone can be powerful tools for extrapolating findings and conclusions from field studies to conditions not tested (Smith et al., 2000). Therefore, using these types of models to predict the effect of applying deficit irrigation on the yield of several crops could be an ultimate solution to conserving irrigation water.
Deficit irrigation, while it may result in a yield reduction, in general increases water productivity and has the added benefit that the irrigation water saved can be used in new lands. However, testing these deficit irrigation practices in the field is expensive. Therefore, simulation models could partially substitute for experiments to test different deficit irrigation scenarios and be used to develop recommendations for the conservation of irrigation water and the minimizing of yield losses. Three models were selected for that purpose, CROPWAT, Yield-Stress and CropSyst. Our objective was to use these models to assess the effects of different deficit irrigation scenarios on the yields of crops planted in the field trials.";"Khalifa, Hamdy

"mel:20.500.11766/7358";"Global Geo-informatics Options by Context (GeOC) Tool for Supporting Better Targeting and Scaling-out of Sustainable Land Management: Designing the System and Use Cases";"";"Sustainable Land Management (SLM) are required to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). SLM options are fitted to the social, economic and ecological contexts. The high contextual diversity of drylands in particular prevents the design and application of “uniform blanket” policies to promote SLM over large scales where significant impact is expected. To address this challenge the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems (CRP-DS) has initiated a web-based geoinformatic tool for overviewing, comparative assessing and co-learning SLM options fitted to the social-ecological context at global, regional and national scales. This Global Geo-informatic Options by Context (GeOC) tool aims to support the implementation of SLM practices by the local and international communities and to help countries report on their commitments to achieving LDN via the UNCCD and Sustainable Development Goal 15. This working paper presents the concepts and technical frameworks designing the GeOC and its typical use cases.
The GeOC tool is designed to provide land users, projects/programmes and policy decision-makers with plausible, robust extrapolation domains for guiding decisions on the selection and use of SLM options, and an open platform for docking different disciplinary projects into integrative/holistic and converging actions for promoting SLM at scale. It integrates standardized SLM databases such as WOCAT with spatially explicit data on socio-ecological drivers and impacts of land use/management practices to derive plausible soil and water conservation options across different contexts. The tool is based on a systems framework, is scientifically sound and able to cope with the high level of contextual diversity. It can improve linkages among different scales and kinds of data that are essential for SLM implementation, evaluation and out-scaling. By offering common use functions, it is easy-to-use with multiple languages and is an interoperable online tool. It is flexible to allow for continuous improvements and customizations.
Its utility is increased by our use-case approach that provides multiple entry points for diverse needs and preferences of users. A typical use-case is a sequence of limited steps that describes the interactions between a typical user and the information system to accomplish a typical goal. We designed three typical use cases of the tool: (1) searching for implemented SLM options within a user-defined context, (2) searching similar contexts for a given SLM option, and (3) evaluation of land degradation/improvement by context that would be important for assessing gaps in achieving LDN.";"Le, Quang Bao

"mel:20.500.11766/5105";"Broadening land management options for improved economic sustainability across Central Asia: A synthesis of national studies";"";"Land degradation is a pressing concern that reaches
across all republics of Central Asia and is increasingly
affecting the economy and quality of life in each.
The resulting loss of arable land particularly affects
the rural poor, who depend directly on what
the land can provide for their very survival and
livelihoods. The breakup of the Soviet Union led to
mass de-collectivisation of agricultural frameworks
across Central Asia, with formerly centralised land
management regimes dissolved. The reorganisation
of boundaries and priorities quickly led to a
conversion of natural landscapes and traditional
fallows to agricultural and industrial landscapes
dominated by monocrops, water mismanagement,
and a net rise in livestock that now graze in the
same pastures year-round, rather than traditional
nomadic pastoralism on seasonal pastures. Induced
by the establishment of land management planning
that understandably focused on economic growth
but lacked long-term, sustainable strategies, the
land is now becoming dangerously impoverished
under ever-growing demands.
Of the nearly 400 million hectares in the region,
two-thirds are drylands with extreme biophysical
constraints of arid and continental climates,
vulnerable to even the slightest pressures beyond
their capacity and which in turn affect local
populations significantly. Each country faces
unique challenges related to their landscape and
agricultural demands, but across the board there
are widespread losses of fertile topsoil and nutrients
necessary for growth, declining productivity of
crops and pastures, losses of biodiversity and
habitats, increasing salinisation and deforestation,
and increasing weed infestation in rangelands.
Estimates are imprecise due to a lack of research to
date, but degradation is observed to be extensive,
ranging from 4-10 per cent of cropped land, 27-68
per cent of pasture land and 1-8 per cent of forested
land, in total representing 40-100 per cent of land
degraded in each country. In Kazakhstan, 48 million
hectares of land are now degraded due to land
conversions, and in Kyrgyzstan over 30 per cent of
all highland pastures are degraded. Tajikistan saw
an estimated loss in GDP of 7.8 per cent (USD 5.6
billion) in 2010 as a direct result of land degradation.
In Turkmenistan, 70 per cent of all pasture lands
are degraded and in Uzbekistan, over half of the
irrigated landscapes suffer from salinisation due to
improper management.
This is a growing issue in need of addressing,
with immediate action at governmental levels to
establish long-term sustainable land management
strategies for the well-being of their economy and
people. Part of these strategies necessarily includes
understanding the biophysical aspect – the science
– behind land use changes. However, for decisionmakers,
there is also a need to understand the
economic outcomes of land management planning,
in order to make choices that optimally reflect the
most beneficial scenario both economically and
environmentally. It is on this basis that in 2015, the
Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative
supported the development of a regional Central
Asia study, with case studies in each country in
identified ecosystems. National-level researchers
from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan were supported in
the undertaking of cost-benefit analyses for current
land management scenarios, as well as feasible
alternative scenarios that integrated sustainable
land management, to determine economically viable
choices for sustainable land management planning.
Specific ecosystems were selected to cover a range of
landscapes across the region, so that the countries
could engage in knowledge exchange and sharing
of best practices, including high mountain pastures
(Kyrgyzstan), foothill pastures (Tajikistan), forests
(Kazakhstan), lowland pastures (Turkmenistan), and
irrigated agriculture (Uzbekistan).
These analyses moved beyond the market value
for crops that normally act as an indicator for land
value. They included a range of ecosystem services
benefits, from carbon storage and sequestration to
nutrient provision and cycling, which fall into four
categories as part of an attempt to measure total
economic value of land. While not valued directly
in market prices, these values (and the loss of them)
do eventually factor into future economic losses or
benefits, depending on their maintenance and use.
For example, in Kyrgyzstan, there are net benefits
when carbon value is considered explicitly, but the
current economic incentives for land managers
do not encourage this. In Tajikistan, increasing
agricultural productivity leads to improved
livelihoods, while incurring only minor economic
losses from managing pasture lands in a way that
prevents emergency situations.
Total economic valuation is becoming increasingly
used in international arenas to enhance
understandings of the benefits of land and landbased
ecosystems. They factor into international
agreements and binding UN conventions, and
can help countries meet targets such as those
outlined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals,
ratified in New York in 2015, particularly Goal 15:
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of
terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests,
combat desertification, and halt and reverse land
degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
These cost-benefit analyses also help identify how
to share benefits so that land users like farmers and
herders who can directly support sustainable land
management and thus create economic benefits,
can reap rewards that are otherwise distributed
throughout the rest of society. For instance, efforts
to reduce deforestation can contribute directly
to carbon sequestration and thus play a role in
mitigating climate change – benefits which do
not necessarily accrue directly to farmers, and
of which other members of society benefit from.
Rewarding sustainable land management practices
through the provision of these economic incentives
is a powerful tool in establishing sustainable land
management, which is sorely needed in light of the
severe degradation and subsequent economic and
environmental losses faced across the Central Asian
republics.
This regional report presents the findings of all
five country-level research reports, following the
outline of the ELD Initiative’s 6+1 step approach.
Unique characteristics and findings from each
country, alongside shared challenges and concerns
uncovered throughout the project are put forward.
Finally, the report concludes with a summary of
recommendations borne out of the research, and
intended to support policy-/decision-makers in
developing informed policies for sustainable land
management.
Beyond understanding the economic drivers of
sustainable land management, these decisions
will also need to address the lack of data, research
support, and institutional capacity, lack of intersectoral
coordination and regional cooperation at
the political level, as well as the need to empower
the ministries responsible for land use management,
which currently lack the necessary power and
influence. In doing so, the Central Asian republics
can root their future in the sustainable productivity
of their shared landscapes, stabilise food, water, and
energy security, and move towards an enhanced
future for the health of their people, economy, and
environment.";"Quillerou, Emmanuelle

This increase runoff and soil erosion, and reduce agricultural productivity, as well as increasing risks of flood damage to crops and infrastructure. Implementing adaptation measures and improved land management through erosion control and soil protection are among those that protect water and agriculture and limit their vulnerability. Soil erosion control practices are often based on long-term climatic averages. Special attention is needed to provide protection against average high-return frequency storms as well as severe storms with low-return frequency. Suitable and affordable soil conservation plans, coupled with an appropriate enabling environment, are needed. A watershed and community were selected in the mountainous area of North West Syria. The fields represent the non-tropical highland dry areas and dominated by olive orchards on steep slopes. Farmers were aware of resource degradation and productivity reduction, but lacked financial capital to implement the needed adaptation measures. A micro-credit system was established with the help of the UNDP Global Environment Facility - Small Grants Program (GEF-SGP) with small grants available for each farmer. Haphazard implementation on scattered fields proved inefficient in demonstrating obvious impact. Therefore, each watershed was classified into three erosion risk categories (high, moderate and low), derived from maps of flow accumulation, slope steepness, slope shape and land use. Using field survey of land ownership, the boundaries of 168 farms in the watersheds were mapped. Farmers' fields were classified using the erosion-risk map and considering the on-farm erosion hazard and the off-farm effect on other farmers' fields following the hillslope sequence. More than 60% of the farms were classified into high erosion risk areas. Accordingly, a community-watershed plan was established and revised with the community committee. Loans to implement soil and water conservation measures were distributed to 52 farmers based on the priorities of their farms. Results from four runoff events in 2009 showed that one erosive runoff event can deliver more than 50% of the total soil loss. Implementing semi-circular bunds reduced rill erosion by 40% and captured 3.4 tons of sediments per hectare. The effect of this approach in limiting the negative impact of extreme rainfall events, at watershed and field levels, are now being quantified and modeled. Keywords: climate change, land use, soil erosion, GIS, flow accumulation, land tenure.

The aim of this study was to contribute to the development of policy recommendations for the improvement of the life of rural families in the Yemeni mountains. Three small mountain watersheds (200-700 ha) in the northern, middle and southern mountain regions of Yemen were selected as the testing grounds for this study. Four interrelated issues that affect these mountain systems were analyzed and evaluated in cooperation with the various stakeholders: natural resources and their management; rural livelihood strategies; community-based participatory agricultural research; and policies and institutional issues. The terraces in the study watersheds were found to be generally well maintained because of a lack of other resources and opportunities. Water was a key issue in these mountain watersheds. Communal water-harvesting reservoirs, springs, and occasionally shallow wells in or near the main wadi, served the household water needs of the communities. During the dry season women and kids walked long distances to collect water from the few remaining sources. The livelihoods strategies of the communities in the study watersheds were diverse, with a large percentage of the households receiving incomes and remittances from jobs in towns (32%) or abroad (3%). On average, 39% of the households were perceived to be poor or very poor. Community-based participatory research is essential for tackling the crop and livestock production 
problems and options in these complex mountain agro-ecologies. Government support programs need to be restructured and the capacity of these communities need to be built to enable them to organize themselves and access the needed support to improve their own livelihoods.";"Bruggeman, Adriana

Sustainable management of soil and water is necessary to optimize the use of limited rainwater for crop production and to decrease soil erosion. One management option is utilizing rainfall more efficiently through water harvesting. In arid areas, different types of water harvesting techniques (WHT) are being developed by
researchers and used by farmers to utilize runoff water and to enhance plant growth. However, the effect of water harvesting on the reduction of soil erosion and runoff is not adequately known. This study aims at adapting the SWAT model to predict the impacts of selected water harvesting interventions on the bio-physical and hydrological processes and to evaluate their application in arid environments. Four sites,
representing small sub-watersheds (hill slopes) were selected for modeling purposes in Al-Majidyya village 40 km south-east of Amman, which represents an arid area of Jordan (known locally as Al-Badia). The average annual rainfall in this area is less than 150 mm. Two small sub-watersheds (paired swales) were selected to measure runoff and erosion, using flow meters and ISCO automatic samplers. One of these swales has been treated using Vallerani plough to form intermittent pits to collect and store runoff water.
This swale was planted by Salsola vermiculata shrubs and the other swale has been left without any intervention (control representing the natural rangelands in the area). The other two small sub-watersheds (paired swales) were selected to measure sediment yield only using geo-textile trap. One of these paired swales contains continuous contour ridges as water harvesting measure and was planted with Atriplex halimus shrubs while the other sub-watershed was left without intervention and planted with Barley (Hordeum vulgare), representing the farmer practices. The model input parameters were derived
using the SWAT ArcGIS Interface. Some parameters (Leaf Area Index and Harvest Index) for plant growth were modified to suit the prevailing arid conditions in the watersheds. Many iterations were carried out by introducing different management options in SWAT databases taking into account the subbasin, HRU and curve number values. The model overestimated the runoff and sediment yield from the water harvesting sites and to large extent accurately estimated for the sites without interventions. For example, the sediment yield predicted for the continuous contour ridges for a selected storm was 0.09 t/ha whereas no sediments were observed in the field. The predicted sediment yield for the barley site was 0.55 t/ha and the observed value was 0.34 t/ha. Manual calibration/comparisons for measured and observed results
are needed to adapt the model for this arid environment and to accurately estimate the effect of water harvesting interventions. In addition the comparison of biomass and crop yield will also be analyzed between observed and SWAT predicted outputs.";"Al-Mahasneh, Lubna

Adequate grazing can have a beneficial effect over the duration of the vegetative period of certain species and alternation of short periods of grazing with periods of vegetative rest is generally more favourable than strict or long term protection.

Understanding the relationship among soil nutrient balance, intensification and farm’s economic performance can help improve the efficiency of policy intervention, as well as contribute to the body of knowledge for farm design. This study’s main objectives were to analyse the soil nutrient balances of different farm types and their linkage with farm economic performances and to evaluate scenarios for replenishing soil nutrients in smallholder farms. 
The study was conducted in Ioba Province in the southwest region of Burkina Faso, where five main types of small holder agricultural livelihood systems were identified by an earlier study. By using the Nutrient Monitoring (NUTMON) framework, 15 farms representing the five farm types (three replications per type) were monitored during a full year for cropping, livestock and off-farm activities and related nutrient flows. Soil nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium [N, P and K]) balances were calculated for the whole farm system and the soil subsystem. We evaluated three management scenarios for replenishing soil nutrients: 1) the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario represents the actual practices, 2) the intensification of mineral fertiliser use (IMF) scenario involves the increasing use of mineral fertilisers for replenishing soil nutrients, and 3) the recycling crop residues (RCR) scenario replenishes soil nutrients through enhancing the use of crop residues for fertilising crops.
The study showed the nutrient mining poverty trap in smallholder farms, putting current intensification effort questionable. The scenario analysis indicated that removing the observed nutrient gaps by increasing the use of chemical fertilizers would be costly and inefficient for farmers. Policy interventions and farm design should focus on the subsidiary linkages between livestock and crop production.";"Thiombiano, Boundia Alexandre

interdisciplinary publishing process look like? We address these questions by analyzing the publishing process of the interdisciplinary research project titled “Mountland.” Project researchers published most of their main results as a Special Feature of Ecology and Society. Using the story wall method and qualitative content analysis, we identified ten factors contributing to the success or failure of publishing interdisciplinary research. They can be assigned to four groups of resources: scientific resources, i.e., previous joint research, simultaneously written manuscripts; human resources, i.e., coordination, flexibility, composition of the team; integrative resources, i.e., vision of integration, chronology of results; and feedback resources, i.e., internal reviews, subject editors, external reviewers. According to this analysis, an ideal-typical publishing process necessitates, among other things, (1) a strong, interdisciplinary coordinator, (2) a clear shared vision of integration and a common framework, (3) flexibility in terms of money and time, (4) a certain sense of timing regarding when and how to exchange results and knowledge, (5) subject editors who are familiar with the specific project and its interdisciplinary merits, and (6) reviewers who are open minded about interdisciplinary efforts.";"Pohl, Christian

a large amount of water is consumed during its growing season. Accurate paddy rice maps
are therefore important inputs for improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration in the
agricultural landscape. The main objective of this study was to obtain flooded paddy rice
maps using multi-temporal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) in the Krishna River Basin, India. First, ground-based spectral samples collected
by a field spectroradiometer, CROPSCAN, were used to demonstrate unique contrasts
between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water
Index (LSWI) observed during the transplanting season of rice. The contrast between
Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) from MODIS time
series data was then used to generate classification decision rules to map flooded rice
paddies, for the transplanting seasons of Kharif and Rabi rice crops in the Krishna River
Basin. Consistent with ground spectral observations, the relationship of the MODIS EVI vs.
LSWI of paddy rice fields showed distinct features from other crops during the transplanting seasons. The MODIS-derived maps were validated against extensive reference data collected from multiple land use field surveys. The accuracy of the paddy rice maps, when determined using field plot data, was approximately 78%. The MODIS-derived rice crop areas were also India (Government Statistics). The estimated root mean square difference (RMSD) of rice area estimated using MODIS and those reported by the Department of Agriculture over 10 districts varied between 3.4% and 6.6% during 10 years of our study period. Some of the major factors responsible for this difference include high noise of the MODIS images during the prolonged monsoon seasons (typically June–October) and the coarse spatial resolution (500 m) of the MODIS images compared to the small crop fields in the basin. However, this study demonstrates, based on multi-year analysis, that MODIS images can still provide robust and consistent flooded paddy rice extent and areas over a highly heterogeneous large river basin.";"Teluguntla, Pardhasaradhi

The goal of the research is to activate novel research lines to understand if i) soil-improvement traits can become a target in crop breeding, and ii) bio-available Silicon can contribute to increase drought tolerance of cereals. The research was launched on own funds during fall 2016, and recommended for funding by AFESD in 2017.
This is the first annual report of the Silicon-related component of the research, on the effects of bio-available Silicon on the drought tolerance of Winter Wheat genotypes.

in Uzbekistan. Our research findings indicate that the costs of land
degradation in Uzbekistan are substantial; reaching about 0.85 billion USD annually
resulting from the loss of valuable land ecosystem services due to land use and
land cover changes alone between 2001 and 2009. On the other hand, economic
simulations also show that the returns from actions to address land degradation can
be four times higher their costs over a 30-year planning horizon, i.e. every dollar
invested into land rehabilitation can yield 4 dollars of returns over this period. The priority geographic locations for actions against land degradation are suggested to
be Karakalpakstan, Buhoro and Syrdaryo provinces of Uzbekistan, where the
returns from actions are the biggest. The econometric analysis of a nationally
representative survey of agricultural producers shows that national policies could
enhance the uptake of sustainable land management practices by increasing crop
diversification, securing land tenure and creating non-farm jobs in rural areas.";"Aw-Hassan, Aden A.

Spike samples were collected from more than 1600 farmers from 59 provinces, planted as single-spike progenies, and classified into species, subspecies, and botanical varieties (or morphotypes). Altogether, 95 morphotypes were identified representing three species and six subspecies: einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.), emmer wheat [T. turgidum subsp. dicoccon (Schrank) Thell.], cone wheat (T. turgidum subsp. turgidum), durum wheat [T. turgidum subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn.], bread wheat (T. aestivum L. subsp. aestivum), and club wheat [T. aestivum subsp. compactum (Host) Mackey]. Compared with a nationwide survey in 1920, these findings represent a loss of 50 to 70% of the diversity found in 1920, though in four provinces, little if any loss occurred. Based on the Shannon diversity index (H¢) and number of morphotypes, the highest diversity for bread wheat was observed in Manisa, Konya, Iğdır, Diyarbakır, and Tokat provinces and for durum wheat in Adana, Diyarbakır, and Hatay prov- inces. Socioeconomic data indicated that land- race farmers are found mostly in remote mountainous subsistence communities with very little grain trade, small areas planted to wheat, and relatively simple production technologies. The key reasons famers continue to grow landraces are their grain qualities and adaptation to abiotic stresses. In situ conservation should be targeted at provinces with the highest morphotype diversity, with the rarest landraces, and with the highest share of farmers growing landraces.";"Morgunov, Alexey Ivanovich

Objectives: This study aimed to develop a model that spatially represents a complex human–environment (H–E) system consisting of heterogeneous social–ecological components and feedback mechanisms at multiple scales, in order to assess multi-dimensional (spatial, temporal, and social) trade-offs in ecosystem services.

Methods: We constructed an agent-based model and empirically calibrated it for a semi-arid region in Northeast China, and examined ecosystem service trade-offs derived from the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), which is based on payment for ecosystem services. This paper describes our model, named Inner Mongolia Land Use Dynamic Simulator (IM-LUDAS), using the Overview, Design concepts, and Details and Decision (ODD+D) protocol and demonstrates the capabilities of IM-LUDAS through simulations. 

Results: IM-LUDAS represented typical characteristics of complex H–E systems, such as secondary and  cross-scale feedback loops, time lags, and threshold";"Miyasaka, Takafumi

The Jordan National Land Cover Database (JNLCD) consists of four land cover maps for the years 1984, 1991, 1998, and 2014 that were developed at 30m resolution using a total of 11 Landsat TM/OLI satellite scenes. We primarily applied ISO DATA classification method and rule ­based method for refining misclassified classes. The overall accuracy achieved for the 1984 land cover map was 88% and for the 2014 land cover map was 93%. Results showed that Rangelands underwent the most change in Jordan with dramatic decrease from 12,262 km2 in 1984 to 1,972 km2 in 2014. The net loss of the Rangelands was 9%. This loss is attributed to the expansion of Rain fed Croplands which increased from 1,737 km2 in 1984 to 3,082 km2 in 2014. Further, Irrigated agriculture increased from 288 km2 in 1984 to 1,039 km2 in 2014. Built ­up areas increased from 128 km2 in 1984 to 1,148 km2 in 2014. Over a 30­y period, 19% of the land cover types changed from one type to another once, 6% changed twice, and 1% changed three times. Our JNLCD allows moving beyond simple small­ scale change detection to complex monitoring and assessment programs at the national level. JNLCD will contribute substantially to the advancement of landscape ­based research in the country and allow for carrying out robust studies on, but not limited to, land degradation, carbon flux, and ecosystem services.";"Jawarneh, Rana

Tef is adapted to environments ranging from drought stress to water logged soil conditions. It can be grown at altitude ranging from sea level to 3000m above sea level, with the maximum production occurs between 1700 and 2400m. Tef has its own unique qualities and advantages such as its tolerance to reasonable levels of both drought and water logging.
Tef is the principal crop of Ethiopia and stands first both in area coverage and production among cereals. However, the productivity of the current cultivars in the region is below the national average yield of tef under traditional practices (9.1 q/ha) and improved technologies (17-22 q/ha) on farmer fields. Even though research efforts in the last few decades developed important technologies to overcome production constraints and increase productivity, the productivity has not yet been raised to satisfactory level as compared to the potential. Factors contributing to low yields are practicing of inproper agronomic practices, drought, low soil fertility, soil erosion, poor crop management practices, insect pests and weeds. Among insect pests grasshopper, wollo bush cricket; tef shoot fly, locust and armyworm are some of the major once. Tef shoot fly attacks tef throughout the crop’s active growing period. However the seedling stage is the most critical. Tef production constraints such as lodging, drought, water logging, insect pest heat and frost might be overcome through a comprehensive agronomic practice program.
Development of improved and appropriate agronomic practices (seed rate, sowing dates, seedbed preparation, fertilizer type, rate and time of application), and cropping systems (crop sequence, relay cropping, intercropping, etc.) would greatly contribute to overcoming production constraints and improving productivity of tef.";"Jemberu, Tsedalu

erosion represents a serious environmental problem. The Rmel watershed located in the
Governorate of Zaghouan in north-eastern Tunisia and covering an area of 679 square

Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and geographic information system (GIS).
RUSLE model’s parameters (R, K, LS, C, and P) were derived from digital elevation model
(DEM), average annual precipitation, soil type map and land cover map. They were computed
as raster layers in a GIS environment, then multiplied together to predict soil erosion rates, and
to generate a soil erosion risk map.
Based on this study, the annual soil loss varies across the Rmel watershed from 0 to 186 ton ha

The predicted amount of soil loss and its spatial distribution could provide indications to plan
sustainable land use and management, by showing where the potential erosion hotspots are.
The data generated by this project can contribute to improve current land management and
related economic activities by making available an impact evaluation tool for sustainable land

"mel:20.500.11766/6351";"Phenotypic and Molecular Characterization of Cactus Pear Accessions from Mediterranean and Brazil Collections";"";"Around 2.5 billion people – 30 percent of the world’s population – live in the dry areas, which cover more than 40 percent of the world’s land surface. Scarce natural resources, land degradation and frequent droughts severely challenge food production in these areas. Both North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and the North East of Brazil fall under arid and semi-arid climate. Cacti have developed phenological, physiological and structural adaptations for growth and survival in arid environments where they have multiple functions (food, feed, soil conservation, etc.). Cacti are well positioned to cope with future global climate change; they can generate, under arid conditions, a carbon sequestration equivalent to 30 tons of CO2 ha-1year-1. Cactus pear, the most commonly cropped belongs to the genus Opuntia and compared to other species, Opuntia ficus-indica is the most spread over all continents. The continuous morphological variation within the genus, the lack of clear descriptors for each species, and the relative ease of cross hybridization has led to an erroneous species designation. To overcome these problems, molecular markers might be useful tools to help unravel uncertainties in classification that are not addressed by morphological characterization. The objective of this contribution is to assess the genetic diversity of two cactus collections using morphological and molecular traits. The in situ collections are located at IPA in Northeast of Brazil with 300 accessions oriented toward forage production and at INRA Agadir station with 20 accessions representative of the Mediterranean Basin. Phenotypic characterization was achieved using FAO Cactusnet descriptor while the molecular characterization used the SSR technique and 8 recently recommended primers (Opuntia 3, Opuntia 5, Opuntia 9, Opuntia 11, Opuntia 12, Opuntia 13, Ops 9 and Ops 24). Phenotypic data have been submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) using XLSTAT 2015 package. The Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) dendrogram based on Nei’s genetic distance has been used for molecular, and the relationship between morphological and molecular traits was assessed by Mantel test. Results show that accessions may be discriminated by the morphological descriptors. Many of these morphological descriptors are significantly correlated as the number of cladodes and the number of fruits (r=0.73), the number of cladodes and the plant diameter (r=0.73), the length of the cladode V and the plant height (r=0.7), the length of the spine and the number of areoles (r=0.67). PCA and AHC are good tools to segregate accessions using a reduced number of morphological descriptors. The cladode shape and the number of spines and areoles are the recommended descriptors, and are capable de discriminate accessions with a suitable accuracy. SSR analysis revealed 72 alleles with an average allele number of 9 per locus. All microsatellites used were found to be discriminative with a mean value of Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) estimated at 0.458. Genetic dissimilarities estimated between the accessions varied widely, suggesting that an important genetic variability exist in the collection. All the markers used were either informative or highly informative and can be recommended to detect genetic diversity in Opuntia species; the most discriminant markers are Ops 24 and Opuntia 9 and the less discriminant is Opuntia 5. The relationship between phenotypic traits and the allele based genetic distances from the SSR analysis was highly significant (r=0.4, p=0.01) and obtained for the first time while using SSR for molecular characterization. Consequently, SSR technique is one of the best tools to assess the level of genetic diversity in Opuntia germplasm collections; it complements phenotypic characterization and it is recommended for planning breeding programs and to revise the current taxonomical classification.";"Nefzaoui, Meriem";"";"University of Tunis El Manar (UTM)";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2016-02-05";"en";"land degradation";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"005;015;BRA;DZA;MAR;TUN";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/6351";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/ScJcXwmN";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/ScJcXwmN/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and individual interviews were conducted to collect data on the existing local conventions and on the participation of local population in decentralized natural resource management. In total, the group discussions
included 27 administrative and technical services, and 53 community leaders including women. The individual interviews involved 165 farmers including 54 women. Data collected during these interviews included among others the condition of natural resources in the study sites, farmers' level of knowledge of existing local conventions, strengths and weaknesses of existing local conventions, participation in the elaboration and implementation processes of local conventions. The results of this study showed that local conventions governing natural resources management
exist in all study sites mainly in an informal (oral) form. The level of knowledge of the local conventions differed from one individual to another. Overall, level of knowledge of local conventions was higher in the district of Bougouni than in the district of Koutiala (a score of 3.16 compared to 1.70 on a scale of 0 to 4). In addition, women’s level of knowledge of local conventions was lower than that of men. The results also showed that participation of community
members in the elaboration processes and implementation of local conventions was very low in all study sites and tended to be dominated by a group of individuals, often community leaders and elites. These results suggest that women are marginalized in the elaboration processes and implementation of local conventions. Thus, promoting the participation of community members especially women's in the elaboration and implementation of local conventions processes is essential for a sustainable management of natural resources.";"Umutoni, Clarisse

"mel:20.500.11766/7502";"ICARDA Annual Report 2013";"";"2013 has been a fruitful year for ICARDA marked by research accomplishments and a sense of gratitude. Our longstanding partner countries provided important support in making decentralization of the Center’s research a reality. This transition positions our research programs to more expressly target agroecosystem-based solutions, needed for wider impacts.
The effects of climate change are already being felt in the fragile agroecosystems of the drylands, as challenges are increasing for millions of smallholder farmers dependent on them. Scalable solutions are urgently needed to enable a sustainable food-secure future. The decentralization of ICARDA’s research and capacity development from Tel Hadya, Syria, during 2013 perhaps comes timely. New research sites have been strategically established in Morocco, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Turkey/Central Asia and India to allow the Center’s scientists to contribute more adequately to 10 CGIAR Research Programs, particularly the Dryland Systems program that ICARDA leads. The new setup is also powering up our approach of developing integrated solutions targeted to specific agroecosystems and their livelihood needs, through partnerships with the National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) and other research institutions.
Our ties with NARS were further strengthened this year as host countries opened their doors, shared their research facilities and most of all, joined hands with the Center in our newly aligned research programs for the larger good.
We are also pleased to share the scaling out of some important research outcomes and their impacts in 2013. For example, the innovative adaptation of raised bed machines to small-scale farming – developed with farmers and private sector in Sharkia province in Egypt – delivers a 24% saving in irrigation water and is now being scaled out to other provinces and countries, such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Nigeria, Iraq, and Morocco.
In another significant progress in Africa, funded by the African Development Bank, heat-tolerant wheat varieties, developed in partnership with Sudan over many years, are beginning to enhance incomes and food security in Ethiopia’s lowlands and in Nigeria, where yields are more than doubling. The results are encouraging Nigerian policy-makers to rethink their national strategy and reduce reliance on imports.
For conservation agriculture, converting conventional seeders to ‘zero till’ machines with local private manufacturers is proving catalytic for the uptake of the sustainable practice in multiple countries – including Iraq, Jordan, Morocco. The innovation slashed the cost of seeders, making them far more affordable for smallholders in low-income countries.
The HSAD-Iraq program, funded by USAID, delivered on its promise of strengthening the country’s agriculture sector in a short time through a range of strategic interventions like strengthening the key commodity value chain of date palms, improving certified wheat seed production, and guiding the reform of seed regulations for a robust seed system.
Also, the Dryland Systems program came into full swing in 2013, ready for collective learning, testing and delivery of systems solutions. The program launched 15 Innovation Platforms across the drylands, stretching from the West Africa Sahel to Central and South Asia. Multidisciplinary teams of researchers, policy makers, academia, NGOs and the private sector were mobilized for each platform and are now moving forward to find integrated solutions for drylands in this one-of-a-kind global challenge.
In sum, we are more energized and better positioned than ever before to bring larger impacts for smallholder communities in drylands.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2014-12-08";"en";"development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7502";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/H57BkGjX";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/H57BkGjX/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

"mel:20.500.11766/7503";"ICARDA Annual Report 2012";"";"For ICARDA, 2012 has been a time of change and evolution. We have been busy tackling the many issues of dryland agriculture and global food production against a backdrop of focusing our efforts as a force for change for people living in the world's drylands and our areas of scientific expertise.
The increased unpredictability of temperature extremes and extended droughts has the most severe impact on those living in dry areas and on marginal lands. ICARDA, with its expertise in an integrated agro-ecosystems approach to dealing with such challenges, which we have developed over the years with partner countries, is particularly well-placed today to provide effective and practical solutions for the challenges facing dry areas.
The world of research for development is evolving rapidly, as is the CGIAR Consortium, of which ICARDA is a member. In 2012, ICARDA made significant progress as the leader of the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems. In the program's inception phase a broad range of partners came together to set research priorities and conduct detailed site characterizations in five target regions – extending from Central Asia to West Asia, and North and sub-Saharan Africa. The program is set for full funding and implementation in early 2013. ICARDA is active in ten other CGIAR Research programs – jointly with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in the Wheat Program, and as a partner in nine others.
The conceptual approach of the Dryland Systems Program grows out of the experience and research accomplishments
achieved over the past decades by many organizations and science programs, including CGIAR and its many national
partners. ICARDA brings unique expertise to the Program – through its 35 years' experience in refining integrated agroecosystems approaches with more than 40 dryland countries – to develop improved crop varieties, effective water and land management practices, integrated crop-livestock production systems, and institutional and policy options.
This year, we are pleased to report progress in linking research innovations to results in farmers' fields in a number of areas. These research-for-development initiatives are testing technology and policy packages with farmers in their production situations. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa ICARDA leads the wheat component of the regional initiative on Support to Agricultural Research for Development of Strategic Crops in Africa (SARD-SC). The overall program is led by the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), with the Africa Rice Center and International Food Policy Research
Institute (IFPRI), and funded by the African Development Bank. 
The project, Enhancing Food Security in Arab Countries, has helped increase wheat yields by 25% in project sites in Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen. It has also introduced new technologies to some 6000 farmers through
farmer field schools and travelling workshops.
In the tripartite India–Morocco–ICARDA Food Legumes Initiative, ICARDA facilitates the testing and sharing of practices and new varieties between these regions. A further notable innovation is the introduction of lentil during fallow periods of rice cultivation in West Bengal. This innovation for the region brings improved nutrition, new income-generating products, better soil health, and a new crop – producing up to 1.1 ton/ha of lentil, where nothing was previously produced, during these periods.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2013-01-08";"en";"development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7503";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/B1ZkGVqS";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/B1ZkGVqS/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"";"";"";""
"mel:20.500.11766/7504";"ICARDA Annual Report 2011";"";"Poverty, food insecurity, natural resource degradation and climate change are global challenges; but they impact most severely on rural communities in dry areas. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of good science, integrated research-for-development approaches, and effective partnerships. As this report illustrates, all three elements are in place, resulting in new technologies and tangible benefits in more than 40 countries.
This year saw the inception of the CGIAR Research Program, “Dryland Systems” (CRP1.1) – a global initiative led by ICARDA and implemented in partnership with more than 80 institutions worldwide. The program uses a multi-disciplinary, agro-ecosystems based approach to improve food security and livelihoods in dry areas worldwide. Program partners are  working together to better define research targets, action sites, implementation mechanisms, and monitoring measures in five target regions: West Africa Sahel and the Dry Savannas; East and Southern Africa; West Asia and North Africa; Central 
Asia and the Caucasus; and South Asia.
This report describes new technologies, tools and approaches that ICARDA and its partners have developed. These include innovations in drought mitigation, climate change adaption, water management, control of wheat rust diseases, pest management methods, new lentil varieties to improve income and nutrition, and wheat varieties that combine hardiness with high yield potential.
Two large-scale, multi-country research projects – Enhancement of food security in the Arab region and the Water and Livelihoods Initiative – reported a second season of excellent results. Technologies introduced through these projects are helping to increase crop yields, water-use efficiency and research-for-development capacity in each target country.
Plant breeders have developed new high-yielding, stress-resistant varieties of a range of crops, using germplasm or breeding material supplied by ICARDA. In 2011, at least 26 new varieties were released for cultivation in 11 countries. Low-cost technologies are being scaled out to increase water productivity in both rainfed and irrigated areas. Integrated crop-livestock-rangeland approaches are helping to increase sustainability and productivity in marginal areas, and create new income streams for small-scale sheep and goat producers. National research programs are being strengthened through a Young Scientist Program, initiated in 2011.
Several new initiatives were launched in 2011, aiming to scale out results from earlier projects. New research projects were initiated in South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and West Asia. An agricultural information network was launched, linking seven countries in North Africa and West Asia.
ICARDA joined the Regional Partnership Framework on Food Security in Asia and the Pacific. In South Asia, collaborative research programs were established with Bangladesh and Nepal; and the partnership with India culminated in ICARDA’s Board of Trustees meeting and a joint India-ICARDA Day, both hosted by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.
Development investors have been critical to these successes. ICARDA is highly appreciative of the many donors who have supported the Center’s activities – not only in 2011, but for over 30 years.
In most developing countries, dryland agro-ecosystems hold the key to food security. ICARDA’s goal is to work with partners to unlock the agricultural potential of dryland areas worldwide.

"mel:20.500.11766/7006";"ICARDA Annual Report 2015";"";"The year 2015 will be remembered for the waves of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region looking for a safer future in other parts of the world. While millions of people crossed into Europe, the international community looked for the roots causes of the migration, recognizing that food insecurity, unemployment, drought and environmental degradation all play a role in the uprising and coalescing of conflict.
ICARDA’s work in the severely food-and water-stressed MENA countries puts it in a strong position to contribute to stability in the region. The decades of research and the knowledge we have generated with our partners on drought management, agricultural productivity and natural resources will continue to bear fruit and build more resilient communities. In 2015, we have become more focused on consolidating our efforts with our stakeholders in the affected regions and beyond so we can scale out proven technologies for wider impact.
2015 made history when ICARDA became the first organization ever to withdraw its seed collection from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, the world’s backup facility for storing seeds. The mission, executed with support from the Global Crop Diversity Trust and CGIAR, drew tremendous international attention. The seed collection, originally housed in Aleppo, Syria, has been replicated amid the crisis and is now safely stored in our new state-of-the-art genebanks in Lebanon and Morocco. We extend deep gratitude to all our national partners, particularly in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Turkey, for their extensive support in keeping the dryland’s rich natural heritage alive and safe. Also, we applaud ICARDA’s team of managers, researchers and technicians, and our colleagues in Syria, without whom our transition would not have been possible.
ICARDA’s dynamic mix of strategies based on solid science addresses crop yields, water efficiency, the management of droughts and land degradation, livestock productivity, as well as socio-economics and policy. The strategies aim to respond to the enormous challenges in setting up efficient and effective agricultural and rural production systems in the dry areas.
Our outcomes in 2015 further add to the body of evidence that demonstrates a clear potential and path towards  productive and climate-resilient livelihoods for smallholders and livestock producers – a road towards 'Dynamic Drylands' – the theme of ICARDA’s 2015 Annual Report, which we proudly present.
In Ethiopia, for example, the improved legume varieties developed as a result of our research partnership with the NARS are turning around the country’s declining trend in food legumes production. Higher yields encourage farmers to plant more legumes for domestic consumption and exports to Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. In addition, heat-tolerant wheat varieties continue to transform agrarian landscapes in hot countries, such as Sudan, Nigeria, Senegal and Mauritania, where wheat was never considered as a viable major crop.
And-in 2015-ICARDA took big strides in assisting women to become equal stakeholders in the burgeoning wheat value chains in these countries. Rural communities suffering from long periods of conflict is the tough reality in many places where ICARDA works. We made heartening progress in supporting rural women in Afghanistan through village-based seed enterprises – a model approach to facilitate women entrepreneurship and empowerment.
In Tunisia and Ethiopia, we started new meat value chain initiatives with communities in marginal areas, which are going to be key in building their resilience as climate change worsens the scenario for farming.

International research centers, which have helped drive previous improvements, must continue to deliver new technologies to support sustainable growth in agriculture; and to work with other partners to accelerate the dissemination of these technologies.
During 2010, CGIAR Centers and their partners developed a new framework to help achieve these goals. The framework includes a series of multi-disciplinary research programs where different organizations will work closely together, sharing resources and providing complementary skills. These programs will cover dryland agriculture, climate change, water, livestock, crop improvement and other areas. ICARDA will lead the CGIAR Research Program on dryland systems; and play a key role in the programs on wheat, grain legumes, dryland cereals, water, livestock, climate change, and policies, institutions and markets.
Farming conditions in 2010 were difficult, particularly in dryland environments: drought, new disease epidemics, and continued food insecurity for the poorest households. But research results were encouraging, suggesting that these challenges can be gradually overcome. Twenty five new crop varieties, developed from ICARDA germplasm, were released for cultivation in eleven countries. Low-cost methods to increase water productivity were refined. Conservation agriculture techniques were scaled out across more than 27,000 hectares in West Asia. New tools (biotechnology, GIS, simulation models) were successfully applied to supplement conventional methods. Market analyses helped identify income opportunities for small-scale farmers. And a number of exciting new research projects were launched, on crop improvement, biodiversity, water and land management, socio-economics and policy and other areas.
Partnership is the key – to mobilizing resources, developing and scaling out new technologies, and strengthening policy and institutional support for agriculture. We are happy to report that these partnerships are flourishing. The President of India visited ICARDA headquarters in November 2010, paving the way for a major expansion of collaborative research in South Asia.
National policy makers, including Ministers of Agriculture from four countries, visited ICARDA to discuss research plans. Key donors announced formal agreements to accelerate technology dissemination, under which ICARDA technologies will be scaled out through donor-funded development projects. A conference initiated by ICARDA led to agreement among 24 countries and 12 international organizations, on an action plan to ensure food security in developing countries despite the threat of climate change.
This report describes some of the successes of 2010. It is not a comprehensive record.

"mel:20.500.11766/7506";"ICARDA Annual Report 2009";"";"The dry areas face severe challenges to sustainable development. The biggest challenges – food insecurity, water scarcity, land degradation, and climate change – are closely inter-related. The effects of climate change will be felt globally, but the dry areas will be particularly hard hit. Climate change will exacerbate water scarcity, rainfall variability, and the decline in the natural resource base, and thus could have a profound impact on food security.
Food security and climate change have become priority issues for decision makers. The scientific community must play a leading role in finding solutions – providing farmers with new technologies, and policy makers with better information. ICARDA has a clear focus and, over the last three decades, has conducted successful research in dry areas, developing technologies to improve food security despite water scarcity and climate variability and change.
This report highlights some of the successes achieved by the Center and its partners in addressing these issues. Effective partnerships with national research programs, and generous support from donors, has helped the Center reach farmers, policy makers and other stakeholders, and contribute to poverty reduction and improvements in food and nutritional
security.
The year 2009 saw a major expansion of ICARDA's work in both Africa and Asia. A new office was opened in Ethiopia in October. Building on ICARDA's longstanding partnership with the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, the office will provide support for collaborative activities in Ethiopia and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In China, a new Center of Excellence for Dryland Agriculture was established jointly by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, ICARDA and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). The first coordination meeting of ICARDA's
Regional Program for South Asia and China, held in December, highlighted the strong national support from every partner country – Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and Pakistan – and the need to further expand collaborative research.

The program included presentations by guest speakers, who discussed potential responses to the multiple crises (food-related, environmental, financial and others) faced by developing countries, and the implications of climate change for agriculture in the dry areas.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2010-08-01";"en";"development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7506";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/3Vc8H56Z";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/3Vc8H56Z/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""
"mel:20.500.11766/7507";"ICARDA Annual Report 2007";"";"In 2007, ICARDA celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. The Center and its partners have worked together for three decades to improve the food security and livelihoods of the poor in dry and marginal areas. During this time, we have seen significant changes in the biophysical environment and in socio-economic circumstances. New farming technologies, new livelihood options, and better policies and institutions are speeding up agricultural development in the world's dry areas, and we are proud of the role we have played in this progress.
During ICARDA's Presentation Day held in May 2007, the Center's achievements over the last 30 years were presented to ICARDA's partners – national research and academic institutions, donors, farmer groups, civil society organizations and others. ICARDA's mandate is as relevant today as it was when the Center was established in 1977. The Center's core  mission – research for agricultural development – remains unchanged, but the research agenda has evolved in response to new challenges and changed circumstances. The aim has been, and still is, to conduct demand driven research, to solve those problems that our clients consider important. So, as ICARDA begins its fourth decade, we are increasingly focusing on the pressing challenges of climate change, desertification and rising food prices.
ICARDA's new Strategic Plan for 2007-2016 sets the direction for our response to these challenges. The new plan emphasizes continuity within change: building on our experience in the Central Asia and West Africa (CWANA) region, and widening our scope to include dry areas globally. The plan envisages that we and our partners will be actively involved at every stage in the research-development continuum – strategic research, adaptive research, technology transfer, and 
impact monitoring. We thank all our partners for committing so much time and energy in helping us develop the new Strategic Plan. We commend staff, too, at all levels, for their commitment and hard work. We are also grateful to the members of the two external review panels (External Program and Management Review, and Center-Commissioned External Review on Management and Finance) for their inputs into the process. ICARDA's program structure has been streamlined, and we have recruited topnotch staff to strengthen research in specific areas and to reinforce our
management team.
Successful research-for-development depends on collaboration with all stakeholders, particularly with national agricultural research systems. During 2007 we broadened our already extensive network of partnerships, and strengthened ties with a number of advanced research institutions. For example, agreements signed with institutions in Australia, Germany, Japan and Spain will improve our strategic research as well as our capacity development programs. New agreements with developing-country governments have broadened the reach and the impact of our work at the farm level. We greatly value our relationships with national research systems, as they are an endorsement of our scientific reputation and our commitment to national agricultural development.
New strategic research partnerships entered into in 2007 reflect ICARDA's increasingly global thrust. The Global Rust Initiative, led jointly by ICARDA and CIMMYT, aims to combat a new race of wheat stem rust disease that has already spread from East Africa into West Asia, and now threatens wheat production in other parts of Asia, the Mediterranean, and even the Americas. ICARDA is a partner in another initiative: the Global Crop Diversity Trust genebank in Svalbard, Norway, which will hold the world's largest collection of seeds, and play a key role in conserving global crop genetic diversity. ICARDA will continue to strengthen its research and capacity development programs, to help farmers in dry areas cope with climate change. Our integrated approach combines adaptation, mitigation and ecosystem resilience. Improved crop varieties hold the key to adapting to climate change, improving food security and arresting the upward spiral of food prices. During the year, as many as 26 new varieties, developed from ICARDA germplasm, jointly by the Center and national research programs, were released in 12 countries. They include varieties of wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea and forage legumes, with various trait combinations, such as high yield, drought/cold tolerance, disease resistance, and suitability for mechanized production. There were many other highlights. For example, ICARDA scientists have developed new, rapid, low-cost techniques, using GIS tools, to map agro-ecological zones for better research targeting in large and complex ecosystems. They have identified new biological control agents – using insect-killing fungi – and developed methods to protect wheat crops from the Sunn pest that reduce both pesticide use and production costs. Our biotechnologists are developing a new, robust approach to identify plant genes that confer resistance to drought and other environmental stresses. Farmer-participatory breeding, pioneered in the CWANA region by ICARDA, continues to spread to new countries, empowering resource-poor communities in remote areas.
Improved food legume genotypes have been developed with better nutritional quality (e.g. low levels of tannin, high content of micronutrients). Improved techniques for land and water management are helping to increase water productivity, make better use of scarce water resources, and even to rehabilitate degraded rangeland areas. Protected agriculture techniques are being introduced in Afghanistan, Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula, helping to conserve resources and improve farmers' incomes. Guided by the new Strategic Plan, the Center will now move forward, revitalized and equipped with advanced science and innovative ideas, to continue delivering world-class research products and international public goods to improve the livelihoods of poor farmers in non-tropical dryland areas worldwide.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2008-11-04";"en";"development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7507";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/yJESAuZk";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/yJESAuZk/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

However, implementation of this practice using manual labor or traditional machinery is slow, tedious and costly, and often impractical on a large scale. These limitations can be overcome using the ‘Vallerani’ plow for quickly constructing continuous and  intermittent ridges. The plow (model Delfino (50 MI/CM), manufactured by Nardi, Italy) was tested and adapted to dry steppe (Badia) conditions in Jordan. The performance of the machine, its weaknesses and potential improvements were assessed in the 2006/07 season at three sites on 165 hectares of various terrain, slope and soil conditions. The performance parameters included effective field capacity (EFC), machine efficiency (ME) and fuel consumption (FC). Field tests were carried out at different tractor (134 HP) traveling speeds, pit sizes and contour spacings. Overall mean performance indicators gave an EFC of 1.2 ha/h, 51% ME and an average FC of 5.15 liter/ha. Increasing ridge spacing had a small effect on ME where, increasing traveling speed had a greater effect. A guide table was developed, relating performance parameters with ridge spacing, speed, and bund size setting. This could be a useful reference for the implementation and management of mechanized microcatchment construction in the Badia. The system performed well in the construction of continuous ridges. However, it was unable to construct intermittent ridges at speeds over 4 km/h; problems were encountered in properly staggering the bunds at successive contours.";"Gammoh, I.A.

It also provides general guidelines for determining site potential in relation to various parameters. The approach integrates multi-disciplinary knowledge, use of GIS, and verification in the field to develop and test a methodology to identify watersheds with specific characteristics – in this case, watersheds most suited to project activities within the Jordanian Badia.
The report consists of two sections: the first considers the detailed criteria and the procedure used for site selection; the second considers the biophysical and socioeconomic characterization of selected watersheds.
The whole approach demonstrates how GIS can be used at different scales, using whatever data are available, to help select fields that are suitable for implementing new land-use alternatives. The approach was also successful in integrating biophysical and socio-economic criteria in the selection process, to develop sustainable water harvesting interventions to improve water productivity in the Badia. It is expected that this approach will be applicable to areas similar to those considered by this report.";"Ziadat, Feras M.

For centuries, inhabitants of rangelands have engineered pastoral and farming systems that have sustained their livelihoods in these harsh and dry environments. Unfortunately, these rangelands have undergone profound socio-economic changes where traditional grazing systems (transhumance and nomadism) which had historically allowed for grazing deferment were abandoned. Almost all rangelands are now grazed continuously without any restriction in space or in time. To address the negative effects of overgrazing and also the recurrent droughts, a study was carried out in southern Tunisia aiming at assessing the effect of deferred grazing on plant cover dynamics and productivity. Percent plant cover, species composition, plant density and rangeland production were estimated inside the rested sites (1 year, 2 years and 3 years), controlled grazing sites (one and 2 years after 3 years rested sites) and free grazed sites, considered as control. Preliminary results showed considerable positive effects of the applied restoration technique (rest). The 2 years resting followed by controlled grazing showed a speedy recovery of these degraded ecosystems. Such low cost restoration technique would be considered as an efficient option given the limited or even lack of financial resources to rehabilitate arid rangelands. In addition, it has the advantage of conserving the biodiversity, improving forage production, reducing feed cost and mitigating the negative impact of climate change.";"Louhaichi, Mounir

At present rangelands are being grazed by all kinds of livestock. About 40 percent of feed requirements for horses, donkeys and camels, 60 percent of the goats and sheep are met from rangelands whereas only 5-10 percent of the population of cattle and buffaloes graze in the rangelands despite they are heavily overgrazed, and has reduced the carrying capacity by 30 to 50 percent of their potential. Livestock are under-fed throughout the year because of lack of quality feed and it goes worst during the lean periods (December-February and May-June). Therefore, concerted efforts will be needed to improve the forage production from these rangelands on sustainable basis. In this situation, the cactus plant (Opuntia spp.) has a potential to produce high biomass of green forage –ranging from 30-250 tons/ha and have a source of essential nutrients. The introduction of cactus can reduce the pressure on scarce water resources and rangeland vegetation. Simply during feeding, pads would be harvested, cut into small pieces, and distributed to animals - a ‘cut and carry’ methodology that is common in many cactus-cultivating countries including Brazil, South Africa, and Tunisia. The main objective of plantation of cactus in the dry area of Chakwal is to overcome the pressure exerted on already deteriorated rangelands and non-availability of feed during scarcity months. Furthermore, the fruit of cactus can be sold at the local market to general additional income and enhance livelihood of agro-pastoral communities.";"Louhaichi, Mounir

Many of these systems involve vertical transhumance where flocks and herds are moved up elevation gradients for summer pasturage or horizontal transhumance in which livestock migrate across greater distances in response to regional rainfall patterns and
the resulting availability of forage. In spite of the relatively low earnings of individual herders, these pastoral systems can contribute substantially to the national economies, while providing sustenance and food security to significant portions of the population. Additionally, traditional livestock rearing often contributes a rich social culture in regions where it is practiced and many societies closely identify with traditional livestock herding lifestyles.
In many parts of the world herders still use traditional transhumance systems but they are coming under increased pressure from a number of forces both within and external to these societies. Yet, many rural people living at or near the subsistence level still rely heavily on small flocks or herds that migrate for their livelihoods. These traditional pastoral or agro pastoral systems and the people that use them have an opportunity to employ modern technologies to change and improve with developing technologies.
We studied the Indian Raika (Dewasi/Rebari) horizontal transhumance system of sheep and cattle from their home villages in western Rajasthan to the regions of Haryana and Delhi (Malhotra & Mann1982, Kavoori 2005). During this project we attempted to understand the constraints to production, techniques that could increase animal health and family income of herders. One of the main goals of the project was to also identify programmatic opportunities whereby information at the national or international level could be used to improve sustainability and efficiency of movement from one grazing location to another.";"Louhaichi, Mounir

implications affecting the ability of land to provide food and incomes. Globally, a
large portion of the vulnerable human populations—the rural poor—live on
degrading and less-favored agricultural lands without market access.
Heterogeneous solutions that ensure both economic and environmental
sustainability are needed at multiple scales.
On a policy level, awareness of land and soil degradation is increasing. Last year
all countries adopted a set of goals as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. The specific goal on land degradation includes a commitment for
countries to take steps to achieve a land-degradation neutral world. This
commitment is universal; it will apply to developed as well as developing countries
and covers lands with sufficient rainfalls for agriculture as well as drylands across
political borders.
However, a recent publication claims ‘the end of desertification’ and calls for a
more nuanced approach to the serious problem of global land degradation that
moves away from the emotional rhetoric of expanding deserts and sand-covered
villages, forcing people to migrate into an uncertain future.1 Such doom and gloom
stories dominated international discussions in the late 20th century and provided
the arguments for the establishment of a UN Convention to Combat
Desertification, which is now specifically addressing this issue. Others have
countered this direction of thoughts with a more optimistic view of how populations
can survive by building on traditional knowledge in a new paradigm for people,
ecosystems, and development.";"Thomas, Richard

A glance at any map of the Mediterranean will help explain why both have benefited from this collaboration. Spain is an active member of the European Union but it is also separated geographically by just a handful of kilometers from part of ICARDA's mandate area—North Africa. In history, the connection has been even closer, both politically and culturally, when southern Spain came under the influence of the Arab world.
Parts of southern and central Spain are remarkably similar in climate to some of the agricultural areas of Morocco. Farmers in many regions of southern and central Spain face similar ecological conditions to farmers in parts of Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) where ICARDA works with national programs to improve bread and durum wheats, chickpea and farming systems. The main problem faced by farmers in southern Spain, WANA and Central Asia is unreliable and low rainfall. This means scientists in Spain and ICARDA are working towards similar goals. For example, producing new types of wheat and barley that can grow well even when rainfall is very low during the growing season.
Because of those historical and cultural connections dating back over many centuries, Spanish cooking has evolved to employ many of the same principal ingredients used in food preparation in WANA. Both in Spain and in WANA food manufacturers and scientists are frequently interested in improving the processing quality of the same crops for similar end uses. One example is durum wheat for use as pasta.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2001-12-31";"en";"land management;rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"015;MAR";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7893";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/l7IzacXk";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/l7IzacXk/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"";"";"";""

"mel:20.500.11766/3470";"The Economics of Land Degradation in Africa_Benefits of Action Outweigh the Costs_A complementary report to the ELD Initiative";"";"Land degradation and desertification are among the biggest environmental challenges of our time. In the last 40 years, we lost nearly a third of the world’s arable farmland due to erosion, just as the number of people to be fed from it almost doubled. That’s why the UN General Assembly declared 2015 as the International Year of Soils. And the good news is that this new report shows that while Africa remains the most severely a«ected region, the benefit of taking action across the continent outweighs the cost of implementing it: not just by a little, but by a factor of seven.
Land degradation and desertification, including soil erosion, are made worse by climate change and the poor management of agricultural exports. This has serious implications for Africa and for those dependent on the 97 % of global food supply coming from terrestrial ecosystems. In other words: anybody who eats.
Desertification already a«ects between a third and
a half of the Africa’s land area to some degree. Yet, this report shows that an additional 280 million tonnes of cereal crops could be produced every year, simply by preventing human induced soil erosion. This would be a significant leap towards increasing food security and national income, while reducing food import costs and poverty.
Gathering solid scientific data on these developments is crucial to progress and this report leverages one of the first studies of its kind, focusing on soil erosion and crop productivity on over 100 million hectares of crop lands across 42
African countries. It provides the base line for the much needed imperial data gathering in the next 15 years. It shows that failure to act could impact over 12 % of Gross Domestic Product. And, above all, it makes a credible economic and humanitarian case for Africa to achieve a number of Sustainable Development Goals.
That’s why I am proud that UNEP has been able to work with the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative supported by the GIZ / BMZ, the European Commission and other valued partners to bring this report to life. I would like to thank all of them for their dedication in bringing this work to light. I sincerely hope this will justify the much needed investments in sustainable land management, which are crucial to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in the region and across the world.";"Tilahun, Mesfin

It lays the groundwork for building on 40 years of past achievements, lessons learned, successful partnerships, and investments at the regional and global levels. The strategy is aligned with the national development priorities of the countries we work in, the wider Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Strategy and Results Framework 2016-2030 of CGIAR, with which the Center is affiliated. This Strategic Plan will ensure that the research we undertake and the knowledge we generate continues to be demand-driven, relevant, and aimed at the challenges of smallholder farmers, particularly women and youth.
We recognize that innovation, adaptation, and resilience are key to the future of the organization, just as they are to the future of people in non-tropical dry areas. The ideas are bold and ambitious, and we strongly believe that, underpinned by sufficient resources, they will allow us to achieve the results our partners and stakeholders need and deserve.

an ever increasing demand for our land to produce
a diverse range of products such as food, timber,
and fuel. Our growing need for these goods is
leading to higher levels of competition between
different land uses and, as a result, land users. Not
only is the quantity of land available for production
under current technical and economic conditions
limited, but there is also growing evidence that the
quality of our land is degrading (Safriel, U. N. 2007;
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; TEEB,
2010). As a result, healthy land that is available for
production is becoming an increasingly scarce
resource, and there is a great need to make better
use of what we have available, both now and in
the future.
Improved co-production of knowledge is needed
between scientists, local community members,
technical advisors, administrators and policy
makers. These different groups may be considered
“stakeholders”, defined as those who are affected
by or who can affect a decision or issue (Freeman,
1984). Stakeholder engagement can be defined
as “a process where individuals, groups and
organisations choose to take an active role in
making decisions that affect them” (Reed, 2008). It is
argued that stakeholder engagement may enhance
the robustness of policy decisions designed to
reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and human
populations to land degradation (de Vente et al.,
in press). In this way, it may be possible to develop
response options that are more appropriate to the
needs of local communities and can protect their
livelihoods and wellbeing (ibid).";"Musekamp, Claudia

"mel:20.500.11766/3476";"Jordan Case Study An economic valuation of a large - scale rangeland restoration project through the Hima system in Jordan";"";"Jordanian rangelands are a source of valued
livestock produce, carbon storage, biodiversity, and
medicinal plants. They also serve as watersheds
that receive rainfall, yield surface water, and
replenish groundwater throughout the area
east and south of the western Jordan highlands.
Appropriate land management, which is currently
lacking, can protect and maximize these services
for society. With the acceleration of desertification,
land degradation and drought during the twentyfirst
century in the arid and semi-arid regions of
Jordan, these services are becoming jeopardized.
It is therefore increasingly urgent to define and
pursue viable strategies to reverse this trend. One
approach which is gaining increasing attention in
Jordan is the ‘Al-Hima’ land management system.
This is a historical and traditional system of land
management in the Arab region that encourages
the sustainable, shared use of common resources
amongst relevant communities.
To inform the debate surrounding this approach,
this paper presents an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis
of large-scale rangeland restoration through
the Hima system within the Zarqa River Basin,
drawing on experience from a pilot initiative by
IUCN and the Jordanian Ministry of Agriculture
(MoA) since 2010. The ecosystem services that
arise from rangeland restoration are valued using
a combination of stated preference, avoided costs,
replacement cost and market prices approaches.
The economic analysis has built on high-resolution
remote sensing, GIS, and biophysical soil and water
assessment tools, and was elaborated to rigorously
calibrate the impact of land use changes on forage
availability, ground water infiltration, carbon
sequestration, and sediment stabilisation. Benefits of large-scale rangeland restoration
from the Hima system were found to outweigh
the management and implementation costs at a
discount rate of 8 per cent. Given this encouraging
result, different policy instruments that may be
used to incentivize the restoration of rangelands
in Jordan are discussed. In particular, ensuring
pastoral communities have long-term stakes in
rangeland resources, the government should
first and foremost assign appropriate land tenure rights to pastoral communities, (e.g., through
long term leases) allowing them to effectively
manage access to rangeland resources. To finance
a change in the governance structure around
rangelands, the use of a cross-compliance scheme
is suggested, where scarce resources currently
dedicated to unconditional fodder subsidies are
instead partially diverted to promoting sustainable
rangeland management. For example, pastoral
communities practicing water harvesting and
grazing protocols could become eligible to receive
feed subsidies. Such a scheme should be coupled
with the provision of regular extension services
to increase sustainable resource management
capacities within the community.
The case is also made for setting up voluntary
contractual payments for ecosystem service
agreements, where downstream beneficiaries
of rangeland restoration compensate upstream
communities for their efforts. Appropriate policy
instruments that engender sustainable rangeland
management and Hima practices are likely to
be found in a mix of regulatory and economic
incentives.";"Westerberg, Vanja

important for the provision of ecosystem services
like carbon sequestration and maintenance of
the hydrological cycle. The Kelka forest area
occupies more than 300, 000 hectares with 15
villages within and around its boundaries. The
forest resources and soil fertility of the forest
are in continuous decline due to a combination
of climatic and human induced factors. For
example, the availability of firewood has halved
over the past 15 years due to a lack of adequate
forest and land management.
Sustainable land management interventions
that can reverse the current trend of forest and
land degradation are increasingly necessary,
but large scale interventions need to be
grounded in solid assessments of their potential
economic and financial value to the local and
the global society. To address this need, the
paper presents an ex-ante cost benefit analysis
of large-scale agroforestry and reforestation in
the Kelka forest to inform decision-makers about
the value and importance of changing current
land use practices. The economic valuation uses
‘productivity change’, ‘avoided cost’, ‘replacement
cost’, and ‘market based’ valuation methods. The
analysis is based on high-resolution remote sensing
techniques, an explicit spatially distributed
hydrological model, and a crop growth model,
developed to assess the impact of land use change
on firewood availability, soil moisture, carbon
sequestration, and nitrogen fixation.
Using different discount rates, results indicate
that the benefits of large-scale agroforestry and/
or reforestation are significantly higher than the
costs of implementing the restoration options
over a 25 year time horizon. Different options for
incentivizing agroforestry and restoration of the
Kelka forest are discussed.";"Hodel, Elias

Yet, significant shortcomings in vision, influenced by historical ideology and contemporary friction, mitigated the full development of private land ownership. Leasing of land from collective (Kolkhoze) and state (Sovkhoze) farms was legally permitted and proceeded accordingly. Private ownership, with the ability for purchase and sale, was not permitted; however, allocation of land for private household production, with permitted sale of produce into local markets became increasingly common. While leasing of state land was aimed at fostering improvements in productive efficiency in order to increase the volume of production for key state commodities (predominantly cotton and wheat), the distribution of land for private household production, with perpetual user rights, was aimed at enhancing food security within rural communities.

Macronutrient flows and balance in agricultural systems are important for assessing the system sustainability as they indicate what supply risks an agricultural system runs, how resilient the system is to these risks, and what environmental impacts arise from the use of that essential resource.  We apply the environment system’s criticality approach, and Material Flow Assessment (MFA) modelling to macronutrients (N, P, and K) in three different smallholder farming system (SFS) types in the village cluster of Pontieba, Ioba Province, Burkina Faso. Two criticality indicators of system sustainability were highlighted. First, the three SFS types are not facing equal nitrogen supply risks. The average depletion time of soil nitrogen stocks ranges from some 10 to 170 years. The SFS type I (poor, landless, and subsistence-based farms) and type III (better-off, land-and labor-rich, cotton- and livestock-turned) have short nitrogen depletion times compared to the SFS type II (medium-income, high dependency, cotton-and livestock-turned). Second, the reduced dependency on external nutrient inputs (e.g. fertilizer application) is an indicator measuring resilience to supply restriction. In Pontieba, regardless of types of SFS or macronutrient, reliance on own nutrient resources never surpasses 50%. The study showed that the environment system’s criticality approach and nutrient flow modelling can contribute to the implementation of SI practices through support at four levels: 1) providing a holistic view on the SFS to avoid problem-shifting and enable prioritization, 2) providing options to reduce resource criticality, 3) mutual learning between researchers and smallholder farmers through knowledge integration, and 4) facilitating coherence of agroecosystem management from local to national levels thanks to the approach applicability on different scales.";"Meylan, Gregoire

Inter-linking socially interactive decision-making to relevant ecological processes faces a great challenge due to at least two reasons: (1) the inherent mismatches in the spatial and temporal scales the considered processes operate, (2) differences in relevant methods for modelling the processes and (3) different data availabilities for the processes. There has been a direction that uses multi-agent system (MAS) as a conceptual framework and unified computer platform for integrating different specific modelling methods of relevant ecological processes with human decisions on agriculture and ecosystem management. This study analyses and illustrate how the above challenge is addressed by Land Use Dynamics Simulator (LUDAS) framework with implementations in selected landscape ecosystems in West Africa (Burkina Faso) and Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Indonesia). We modeled inter-linkages between interactive household land-use decisions and four relevant ecological processes: crop production, forest timber growth, vegetation type transitions, and changes in plant species diversity. First, each of these ecological processes was modelled by relevant methods, which are response crop production function, system dynamics, cellular automata and species-area relation for crop production, forest timber growth, vegetation transitions, and plant species diversity, respectively. Second, these sub-models were encoded within a MAS framework to establish inter-linkages. Third, through structural sensitivity analyses (i.e. comparison of simulated socio-ecological systems between WITH and WITHOUT socioecological inter-linkages), as well as multi-criteria discussions of methodological options, we constructed a matrix of methodological options for modelling socio-ecological linkages, their benefits and limitations. The matrix would be a provisional knowledgebase that adds methodological choices for socio-ecological landscape modelers. By concept and current technological availabilities, MAS would be an option being well suited to simulate the co-evolutions of the community and landscape ecosystems.";"Le, Quang Bao

known to influence not only grain yield but also seed quality. A laboratory and field experiment were
conducted in October 2014, to determine the influence of total rainfall and mean monthly
temperature on germination, vigor and emergence of sorghum seeds which were harvested from
three different seasons and were kept under controlled conditions. The laboratory experiment was
a 3 x 3 factorial experiment laid in completely randomized block design (CRD) replicated three
times. The first factor was variety (Macia, SDSL 89473 and Sima), the second factor was growing
season (2004/5, 2006/7, 2007/8). A field experiment was carried out to investigate the emergence
of seed materials used in the laboratory experiment. The experiment was a 3 x 3 x 3 factorial
treatment structure laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with the third factor
being sowing depth at 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 cm. Seedling emergence was observed at 10 days after
sowing. In the laboratory experiment it was observed that there was no significant difference
(P>0.05) on the effects of season and variety on germination of seeds. However, there was
significant difference (P<0.001) on seed vigor due to variety under laboratory conditions. For the field experiment, there was significant interaction (P<0.001) on seedling emergence due to season,
sowing depth and variety. The highest emergence for all varieties was observed at a sowing depth
of 5cm. It can be concluded that maternal season, which is the season in which the seed was
grown, has great influence on the vigor of seed produced under dry-land agriculture. There is need
to repeat the experiment using more seed lots harvested at many different seasons in order to
determine the exact optimum amount of rainfall and temperatures during the maternal season that
will promote optimal germination and emergence of dry-land sorghum varieties.";"Ngwenya, N.

However, shrinking natural resource base, increased land degradation and severe irrigation water scarcity render current crop production practices not sustainable as these perform below their potential. Though there is considerable scope for improving productivity through bridging the yield gaps and introducing sustainable land management practices. However crop productivity and production pattern varies across scales, mostly driven by irrigation water availability, markets, and
agronomic/cultural practices. Climate change could put additional pressure on production systems in the future by decreasing the major source of irrigation water, namely glaciers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop spatial decision systems which provides accurate and timely information on agricultural production that would facilitate the development of target specific and appropriate

ICARDA and ILRI maintain these research sites and conduct field studies in Jordan and Ethiopia, respectively. The study plots are the size of a Landsat pixel (30-m X 30-m) to link local scale TLS to regional scale satellite imagery. A paired-plot: shrubland restoration versus cropping, and livestock grazing was conducted in Jordan and 3-levels of livestock grazing, i.e., high, moderate, and no livestock grazing (a conservation fodder bank) were compared in 4 different villages in southern Ethiopia. We used a FARO Focus 3D X330 with built in GPS, a high resolution digital camera, and a 905-nm scanning laser at approximately 1 million points s-1 at 7-mm spacing per 10-m range over a 650-m radius through 360° in the horizontal plane and 300° in the vertical. This scan spacing resulted in 28 million total points per scan. Each scan has a range accuracy of ± 2-mm with a spot size of 4.5-mm diameter. Four cardinal direction and 1 plot center scan were taken per site for a total of 10 scans from the paired plots and 61 scans from the villages.. Vegetation structure, including height, volume, crown and basal area, diameter-at-breast height (dbh) ,canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), & plant density and soil structure, including topography can be directly measured using TLS. Biomass and sediment loss, i.e., soil erosion are indirectly estimated using allometric equations that use height. A Kolmogorov– Smirnov (K-S) tests was conducted on the height diversity histograms of the vegetation point clouds at each site, which is representative of the foliage profile, to test the null hypothesis that different land uses do not impact land cover.
This research has quantified the impact of different land uses on forage availability or changes in carbon stocks that are relevant to subsistence pastoralists. Such information can inform agro-ecological models and can be linked to broader implications for management decisions. The development of sound policy is dependent on improved information for management decisions. This research will also assist future work in arid lands by determining the best indicator and methods for vegetation measurements with ground and airborne LiDAR systems in Drylands. With this information other Dryland sites will be scanned and their ecological and degradation status will be determined.";"Washington-Allen, Robert  A.

Different strategies and approaches for conserving soil and water and restoring degraded lands have been developed by local, national and international agents to synergise efforts towards land degradation neutrality achievement. Tunisia is a dryland country facing a high risk of land degradation over more than 50% of its territory. It is a country with high investment programs for soil and water conservation (SWC), and large level adoption of SLM practices. With some successes and failures experienced, there are currently no sufficient information that could allow knowledge based assessment of such investments and commitments. The need for up- and out-scaling success stories is challenged by the lack of real time spatial data on SLM practices. In this work, the main objective is to make an inventory and document the widely adopted SLM practices in Tunisia, and develop a spatial database of such practices for impact assessment and scaling out/up. The work was based on literature review, field based data, secondary data from national institutions, and high resolution satellite images. The work was conducted in two pilot sites (Medenine governorate in South-Eastern and Zaghouan governorate in Centre-North) located in different socio-environmental contexts of Tunisia. Many technologies exist in the context of Tunisia, showing a high diversity of initiatives to combat land degradation and ensure sustainable lands. In this works, eighteen (18) SLM practices were investigated in two pilot sites. This diversity emerges from the synergies from land users, researchers, policy-makers and donor agencies, in order to improve land management, conservation and restoration in arid areas of Tunisia. Each specific context revealed specific SLM practices, even though there exist some similarities. Some practices are very common, and widespread whereas others are very locally applied. These SLM practices target specifically soil and water conservation, the control of sand dune mobility, the improvement of degraded rangelands, the collection and storage of runoff water, and the improvement soil surface cover through tree plantation. Based on field observation, there is a high adoption level, which should be encouraged and supported by scientific documentation for policy orientation in order to achieve land degradation neutrality in Tunisia.";"Diwediga, Badabate

in terrestrial ecosystem research in the recent decades. However, a certain limitation was
observed while applying these indices in research in dry areas due to their low sensitivity
to low vegetation cover. In this context, the objectives of this study are to develop a new
vegetation index, namely, the Generalized Difference Vegetation Index (GDVI), and to
examine its applicability to the assessment of dryland environment. Based on the field
investigation and crop Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurement, five spring and summer
Landsat TM and ETM+ images in the frame with Path/Row number of 174/35, and
MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LAI and vegetation indices
(VIs) data (MOD15A2 and MOD13Q1), of the same acquisition dates as the Landsat
images, were acquired and employed in this study. The results reveal that, despite the same
level of correlation with the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as other VIs, GDVI shows a
better correlation with LAI and has higher sensitivity and dynamic range in the low vegetal
land cover than other vegetation indices, e.g., the range of GDVI is higher than Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced
Vegetation Index (EVI), Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), and
Soil-Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI), by 164%–326%
in woodland, 185%–720% in olive plantation, and 190%–867% in rangeland. It is, hence,

The methodology, which uses commonly available technologies and information such as remote sensing and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), was developed and tested using newly constructed hill reservoirs (used to capture surface runoff) and traditional water harvesting systems.
Supplemental irrigation potenatial was studied in a pilot area, Oued R’mel in north-eastern Tunisia, Starting with currently operational hill-reservoirs, Aster images and DEM ﬁles were used to map sites suitable for intercepting water along short-lived watercourses. Indices to describe land suitability for irrigation were derived by combining qualitative soil information with DEM data. The outscaling operation from pilot site to the entire country was carried out through several steps, taking into consideration changes in suitability attributes related to changes in rainfall. The end product was an overlay of areas suitable for constructing hillreservoirs on a map of soils receptive to irrigation, on a scale of 1/500000.
Traditional water harvesting systems were studied at a pilot watershed, Oum Zessar, in the hilly arid (rainfall < 250 mm) area of southern Tunisia. The study focused on techniques used on steep slopes (Jessour) and piedmonts (Tabia). Slope and size of the watershed (separately) were the main criteria for deﬁning land as suitable for Jessour and Tabia. Through iterative operations, we found optimums for pixels aggregation to set suitability conditions. The analysis also included geo-referenced data on local population in order to identify socioeconomic factors that could determine success. The most important factor was direct involvement of local farmers in water harvesting and use.";"Ben Mechlia, Netij

The strategies evaluated have to be economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally sound in the three different agricultural eco-systems. These eco-systems are located on three selected canals, the Alatf canal (improved versus not improved misqa community in the Menofia Governorate), the El-Bustan canal (a water users association (WUA) versus a no water users association community in the Nubaria Area), and El-Shoka canal (a fresh water using versus a drain water using community in Damietta Governorate).
This report assesses and evaluates the Egyptian Irrigated Benchmarks site. Given the limitations of the data obtained from the trials conducted, the results presented are preliminary and subject to further verification through wide-scale experimentation and in demonstration trials on farmers’ fields.";"El-Najjar, A.

This suffers from the criticism that it does not take into account the possible influence of measurement error and other noise in the data (Coelli, 1995). The second approach uses econometrics to estimate a stochastic frontier function, and to estimate the inefficiency component of the error term. The disadvantage of this approach is that it imposes an explicit and possibly restrictive functional form on the technology. However, this approach is chosen here because it permits estimation of the determinants of the inefficiency of the producing unit, which is the focus of this study.";"El Amin, Abbas Elsir

causes environmental change. Taking the Ordos rangelands in China as a case
study, this paper explores the potential of remote sensing to assess in dryland
areas the impacts of policies on the environment. Thirteen Landsat images of the

implementation of different policies were selected for land-cover change analysis;
others were used to check the detected change and track the normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) trajectory matched with time series of
meteorological data for calibration of natural response of rangelands to rainfall.
The results indicate that policy impacts are complex and include both positive
and negative aspects depending on the locality in space. On one hand, policies
have aroused the enthusiasm of people in agricultural production and sandcontrol
leading to the recovery of about 2618 km2 of desertified rangeland and
sandy land, and economic growth, on the other hand, provoked vegetation
degradation with an accumulated area of 2439 km2 when policies cannot
reconcile the conflict between environmental protection and the interest of rural
people. However, degradation is not absolute and can be mitigated by the
implementation of rational policies.";"Wu, Weicheng

"mel:20.500.11766/7511";"ICARDA Annual Report 2001";"";"The world is witnessing a period in its history when the increasing socio-political upheavals are taking the lives of thousands, and destroying the natural wealth of our planet. Poverty and food insecurity are two key forces driving this destruction. These ongoing problems compound those already being posed by an increasing shortage of water, scarcity of productive land, an expanding population, and the threat of global warming. 
ICARDA strongly believes that solutions to these problems can only be found through innovative partnerships. Working with its partners the Center can widen the scope of its research geared to reduce poverty, increase food production, and protect the natural resource base throughout the dry areas of the world. The year saw a major breakthrough in forging new partnerships.
For example, the war-torn and drought-hit Afghanistan urgently needs support to rebuild its agriculture. In 2001, ICARDA initiated a major international effort—The Future Harvest Consortium to Rebuild Agriculture in Afghanistan—to help the country achieve sustainable development of its agriculture and reduce poverty and hunger. The Consortium is drawing together partners and expertise from many organizations, including the CGIAR, UN agencies, U.S. universities, local and international NGOs, and USAID and other donors. The most immediate problem facing Afghan farmers is the lack of good quality seed, so the Consortium has developed a detailed plan to multiply and deliver quality seed of adapted varieties, and
to establish an efficient seed production system in the country. Needs assessments for medium- and longterm interventions have been started with full participation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Afghanistan.
Reversal of the trends in land degradation requires a holistic approach that focuses on three key components. First are technological interventions that address land, water and food security problems. Second is the active involvement of local communities employing a strategy that increases their knowledge and organizational capacity. With increased capacity to solve problems and to manage risk, communities can reverse land degradation, generate employment opportunities, improve their livelihoods, and become responsible stewards of the natural resources. Thirdly, appropriate incentives at the policy and institutional level are required to stimulate land users to adopt new technologies to improve their income and quality of life.";"ICARDA, Communication Team";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2002-06-03";"en";"development;farming systems;geographical information systems;land use;poverty;rangelands;research;rural development;water management";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"145;SYR";"Conference Papers & Reports";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7511";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/J4OEumcl";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/J4OEumcl/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/pdf";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""
"mel:20.500.11766/7510";"ICARDA Annual Report 2002";"";"The year 2002 marked ICARDA's 25th anniversary, and coincided with several honors and awards for the center's excellence in research. Research on developing high-yielding kabuli chickpea varieties that thrive in cool, wet winter conditions earned the 2002 King Baudouin Award of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), jointly with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), which focuses on desi chickpea. Several ICARDA researchers won both national and regional awards for their contributions to improved crop production and protection of the natural resource base in dry areas.
The Center made a substantial contribution to the global efforts to rebuild agriculture in Afghanistan. In January, it convened a meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, which was attended by representatives from 34 international organizations, including non-governmental organizations, and 10 of the 16 CGIAR centers. Based on the recommendations of the meeting, the Future Harvest Consortium to Rebuild Agriculture in Afghanistan was established. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Development Research Center (IDRC) provided funds to implement the Consortium activities.
Led by ICARDA, the Consortium made rapid progress. With the overall objective of restoring and enhancing the food production capacity of farmers in Afghanistan, priority was given to multiply and deliver quality seed of adapted varieties to rebuild, with Afghan partners, an effective seed multiplication system that promotes the use of high-quality seed. As part of this effort, over 3500 tonnes of certified seed of wheat was provided for spring planting, and 5000 tonnes for the fall 2002 planting. The seed reached over 100,000 farm families. A ""Code of Conduct"" was developed to form the basis for a national seed policy and regulatory framework for Afghanistan.
The Consortium's research agenda went much beyond seed systems. It organized four needs assessments that obtained information from farm families throughout the country on (i) seed and crop improvement, (ii) soil and water management, (iii) livestock, forage and range, and (iv) horticulture. Information from these assessment missions was reviewed and discussed at a wrap-up meeting held at ICARDA in November 2002, and will form the basis of a wide range of crop, livestock, and infrastructure rehabilitation projects in 2003 and beyond. Several research laboratories were refurbished. Over 100 Afghan researchers were trained in key areas of research. The Center continued its efforts with increased momentum to strengthen its partnerships. To set regional priorities for agricultural research in the CWANA region and integrate them with the CGIAR priorities, researchers and research administrators, and representatives from the non-governmental organizations, farmer associations and the private sector, from throughout Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA), met at ICARDA headquarters to review the recommendations of the five sub-regional priority-setting meetings organized by ICARDA, in cooperation with the Association of Agricultural Research Institutes in the Near East and
North Africa (AARINENA) and the Regional Forum for Central Asia and the Caucasus (CAC) in 2001/2002. This effort should help increase the relevance, efficiency and impact of ICARDA's research. The year saw increased participation of ICARDA in global conventions and in implementing their recommendations.
The Center participated in the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), held in Johannesburg, South Africa. On behalf of the CGIAR, the Director General of the Center made a presentation in which he highlighted the role of agriculture in improving the quality of life of the poor, in protecting the natural resource base, and in promoting economic growth. He also made a statement on CWANA at the plenary devoted to regional implementation of the WSSD action plan.
ICARDA enters 2003 with increased focus on its mission to improve the welfare of the poor in the world's dry areas while preserving the natural resource base upon which we all rely.

"mel:20.500.11766/4897";"Restoration of Degraded Lands in West Africa Sahel: Review of experiences in Burkina Faso and Niger";"";"This is a comprehensive literature review of land restoration activities in West Africa Sahel.
Water constraints and the inherent soil poverty are the major factors that limit crop yields and productivity of cropping systems in West Africa Sahel (WAS). Livestock is not well integrated with agricultural activities and crop residues are usually exported from the farm for household needs and animal feeding. In traditional systems, soil fertility maintenance was based on a relatively long fallow period (10-15 years) followed by a short cropping period of 3 to 5 years. But the increased population pressure has resulted in significant changes of the traditional bushfallow system. Lands are now continuously cultivated for long period with low external inputs, leading to soil fertility decline over time (Bationo and Mokwunye 1991; Bekunda et al. 2010). In addition to biophysical aspects, a wide range of socio-economic factors such as the low financial capacities of poor farmers to invest in agricultural inputs, high pressure on ecological resources for food, fodder or energy, also add to the stress on the systems. Failure by the smallholder farmers to intensify agricultural production in a manner that maintains soil productivity is the main cause of land degradation, particularly in the fragile ecosystems of WAS. Land degradation is defined as a process that leads to the reduction of land productivity for useful purposes, and is typically a result of soil, wind, or water erosion; soil salinization; waterlogging; chemical deterioration; or any combination of these factors (Adeel 2003). Land degradation is a global problem, particularly in the dry areas, home to a large population of poor farmers, where land degradation and water scarcity are major threats to food security. The impacts of land degradation are severe on both human society and ecosystems. Desertification is often wrongly attributed solely to droughts, but it is the deadly combination of continued land abuse during periods of deficient rainfall that results in unproductive land, and ultimately desertification (UNESCO 2003). Combating desertification by rehabilitating degraded lands can be done successfully, using existing, often traditional techniques.
Land restoration involves restoring the fertility of degraded lands. The social syndrome where diminishing availability of lands, inherent low fertility, continuous soil erosion, and continuous nutrient removal without replenishment, results in a spiraling downfall in productive capacity and a diminished resilience of the soil system to provide a suitable medium for crop growth needs to be addressed. Smallholder farmers are at the center of both soil fertility decline and restoration process. Their decisions to manage, to utilize technologies and to improve or restore soil fertility are guided by the socioeconomic conditions and the overall benefits that will accrue from production (Sanginga and Woomer, 2009; Bekunda et al. 2010). A sustainable management of lands under cultivation and the restoration of degraded lands could be achieved by affordable strategic management innovations; taking into account the socioeconomic conditions of farmers. While individual technologies can contribute; a more integrated systems that combines technologies, crops, and trees such as the agroforestry systems could better contribute for sustainable management of natural resources. Many efforts have been invested to developing strategies and approaches for both sustainable management of natural resources and restoration of degraded lands in WAS. In some cases, farmer communities have developed sound, sustainable approaches to land rehabilitation and management but there is insufficient information on successful restoration in the context of WAS, particular with regards to policy, institutions and socioeconomic conditions under which specific approaches could be adapted and applied successfully (Bunning 2003). The main objective of this review was to investigate the main experiences of regenerating degraded landscapes (RDL) in Niger. Going through the documentation, we found many similarities in experiences across the two countries of Niger and Burkina. Some interesting experiences were found in Burkina, Niger or at the same time in the two countries. We finally decided to extend the review to the two countries as a representative zone of the WAS. The critical issue in taking restoration to scale is that ecological, economic and institutional context varies at fine scales.

"mel:20.500.11766/4436";"Determining Optimum Water and Nutrients Leaching Requirements for the Saline Areas of Khorezm, Uzbekistan";"";"Irrational water use and mismanagement are at the root of several environmental problems in the Aral Sea Basin, including secondary salinization. Pre-season leaching (February-March) is a common practice of farmers to manage soil salinity challenges. For example, farmers in the Khorezm region tend applying up to 600 mm of leaching volume to prevent accumulation of salts in the root-zone. However, excessive leaching volume causes the water tables to rise at 1-1.5 m depth which are dangerous depths. These shallow groundwater levels cause secondary soil salinization by capillary rise into the rooting-zone, which nullifies pre-season salt leaching efforts, entails yield losses and seriously threatens economic growth and development. (Grieve et al. 1986; Smets et al. 1997; Willis et al. 1997; Christen et al. 2001; Singh 2004; Murtaza et al. 2006).
Nitrogen (N) plays an important role in crops grown with irrigation. It is important to use an optimum amount of water and nitrogen for the best management of crop production and in the process avoid nitrogen leaching below the root zone (Gheysari et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010). Hence, excessive irrigation/leaching amounts can reduce the effectiveness of fertilizer applications by leaching them below the root-zone and thereby causing reduction in crop yield. On other hand, reduced leaching amounts can cause secondary soil salinity in root-zone.
This study aims to determine the trade-offs between the amounts of water used for leaching salts to control soil salinity but minimizing nutrient leaching and enhance soil fertility, control water table and increase agricultural water productivity and efficiency.";"Benli, Bogachan

"mel:20.500.11766/3524";"Gendered Land Tenure and Water infrastructure in the Chinyanja triangle: The case of Chauluka and Kamwaza villages in Kandeu, Ntcheu, Malawi";"";"According to the Malawi Land Act of 1965, three categories of land tenure exist in the country. These are private, public and customary land. Private land is all land held under a freehold title, a leasehold title or land registered under the Registered Land Act of 1967. Public land is all land occupied by the government while customary land is all land held, occupied or used under customary law (Peters & Kambewa, 2007; Kishindo, 1994:57). Customary land, whose custodians are the chiefs, is very important for food production by small scale farmers since it accounts for 67% of the total land available in the country. Therefore ownership of land is crucial in food production and investments. In Malawi, land tenure is related to marriage systems of matrilineal and patrilineal nature. In the matrilineal system, inheritance and succession run through the female line while in patrilineal it runs in the male line. This entails that land tenure is gendered. It can either be held by a male or a female member of the family. This report sheds more light on the link that exists between gendered land tenure and investments in water infrastructure for multiple purposes in the Ntcheu district of the Chinyanja Triangle.";"Mulwafu, Wapulumuka";"";"";"International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas";"2016-01-03";"en";"land;research";"";"014;MWI";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/3524";"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/U6VUAM00";"https://mel.cgiar.org/graph/getthumbhash/hash/U6VUAM00/fetchthumbs/1/file_type/doc";"CC-BY-NC";"";"";"";""

The purpose of this study is to explore gender roles, relations, constraints and opportunities in livestock production in interdependent agricultural systems of Tunisia, constituting of forest, rangelands and/or agriculture. Overall, there is very little research conducted on gender issues (such as roles, relations, and responsibilities) in agriculture in Tunisia, even less so in rangelands. The FAO factsheet on gender and agriculture in Tunisia was last updated in 1994 (see http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9321e/v9321e00.htm).

"mel:20.500.11766/8266";"Improved Institutions and Governance Mechanisms for Resilient Pastoral Policies in North Africa";"";"Rangelands in North Africa provide vital ecosystem services and play an important role in absorbing CO2. In Tunisia rangelands cover 4.5 million hectares – some 25% of the country’s total landmass. The sustainable management of these arid areas presents complex challenges for local authorities and the communities that depend on them. For centuries, herders have relied on communal rangelands as an eﬀective adaptation strategy for coping with drought. However, currently, civil legislation in Tunisia does not reﬂect the complexity of land tenure across communal rangelands; nor does it eﬀectively support the needs of communities. 
Traditional land tenure systems have now been replaced by a de facto ‘open access situation,’ - which means that access to rangelands cannot be managed or controlled in the traditional manner, resulting in uncontrolled barley cultivation and overgrazing. 
A new ICARDA initiative is supporting authorities to ensure communal rangelands become more resilient through policy reform. The initiative is ﬁnalizing a pastoral law in collaboration with stakeholders and prioritizing a model of sustainable and decentralized natural resource management, which reﬂects traditional Tunisian rangeland management approaches and knowledge.";"Werner, Jutta

use and management is a major cause of declined productivity
in the arid environment. The objectives of this study were
to examine the effects of a sequence of land use changes,
soil conservation measures, and the time since their implementation
on the degradation of selected soil properties.
The climate for the selected 105 km2 watershed varies from
semi-arid sub-tropical to Mediterranean sub-humid. Land
use changes were detected using aerial photographs acquired
in 1953, 1978, and 2008. A total of 218 samples were collected
from 40 sites in three different rainfall zones to represent
different land use changes and variable lengths of time
since the construction of stone walls. Analyses of variance
were used to test the differences between the sequences of
land use changes (interchangeable sequences of forest, orchards,
field crops, and range), the time since the implementation
of soil conservation measures, rainfall on the thickness
of the A-horizon, soil organic carbon content, and texture.
Soil organic carbon reacts actively with different combinations
and sequences of land use changes. The time since
stone walls were constructed showed significant impacts on
soil organic carbon and the thickness of the surface horizon.
The effects of changing the land use and whether the changes
were associated with the construction of stone walls varied
according to the annual rainfall. The changes in soil properties
could be used as indicators of land degradation and to
assess the impact of soil conservation programs. The results
help in understanding the effects of land use changes on land
degradation processes and carbon sequestration potential and
in formulating sound soil conservation plans.";"Mohawesh, Yasser

A field survey was conducted to collect adoption data used for descriptive analysis, and for the estimation of a choice model (Logit).

In contrast, the decision to adopt CA technique is constrained by the low farming experience, existence of off-farm income, and by the number of livestock units per hectare available at the farm level.";"Fouzai, Ayoub

"mel:20.500.11766/6360";"Management of water and salinity in the Nile Delta: A cross-scale integrated analysis of efficiency and equity issues";"";"The overall aim of the project is to identify physical and institutional interventions to improve water management using an integrated approach across scales (from farm to main canal levels) and encompassing water quantity–quality interactions. The project’s geographical focus is the Nile Delta in Egypt.
The project was originally planned for four years. Due to a policy change announced by the Australian Government in reducing the aid investment in the Middle East and North Africa, including Egypt, the duration of the project was reduced to three years.
The project is operating on four different levels: farm, mesqa (tertiary), meso, and macro levels. At the farm level, three different field experiments were carried out for four growing seasons.
Field experiments were carried out during four cropping seasons (summer 2013, winter 2013/14, summer 2014 and winter 2014/15) to evaluate sustainable interventions to combat degradation associated with salt accumulation. Field trials were conducted with various treatments including application of gypsum, organic matter, bio-fertilizers, ammonia injection, and installation of mole drains. The required datasets (soil, water, and plant) were collected and analyses were completed and concluded that application of soil amendments had a significant effect on crop yields and the physical properties of salt- affected soils.
To understand the linkages between water management practices and salt movements, field experiments were carried out with controlled drainage at different levels. A drainage network was installed at different soil depths to control the water table at the required level to evaluate the contribution of the water table to irrigation and to assess salinity build-up. Significant water savings were achieved by practicing controlled drainage at shallow depths. Controlled drainage at shallow depths is not recommended for use with deep- rooted crops such as cotton.
Parallel to research station work, evaluation trials were conducted in summer 2013, winter 2013/14, summer 2014 and winter 2013/14 at the village of Shabab El-Khergeen to monitor the effect of subsurface drainage combined with mole drains on the productivity of different crops. All field trials were implemented in farmers’ plots and compared to their traditional practices. From these experiments it was concluded that introducing the mole drain to heavy clay salt-affected soils improve the efficiency of the wider spacing drainage system. Introducing mole drains resulted in the maximum values of total revenue, net return, and economic efficiency.
Activities at the mesqa level included the following: (1) the detailed monitoring of five collective pump stations (W10 and Abu Mustafa areas), which shed light on water management practices at the local and community level, with a focus on collective action modalities; and (2) a survey of 50 pump stations from the Irrigation Improvement Project (completed by a rapid assessment of 640 stations to check whether they were functioning and still existing), which resulted in an in-depth analysis of the degree of acceptance and efficiency of the IIP project in general and Water User Associations (WUAs) in particular. Many problems were identified such as, mechanical problems and the difficulty to find technical assistance and spare parts; design or construction defects inherited from the implementation of the project; theft of motors; non-implementation of continuous flow in branch canals, which did away with the possibility to see water savings, etc. WUAs were hardly identifiable, at least when looking for formal associations which would perform according to project guidelines and expectations. Yet, with very varied patterns, people organized themselves to operate and maintain the collective pump station, not least because they are often forced to do so by the fact that the mesqa canal has been filled in. The various 'trajectories' of the pump stations were made explicit, revealing how specific and locational characteristics, both physical and social, accounted for a large range of situations, from stations that had never been used, or been abandoned, to cases where some farmers had opted out of the group and reverted to their individual pumps, all the way through stations where pumps had been replaced or electrified. The difficulty to comprehend the diversity of environmental and social conditions pleads for an on-demand project rather than one that is frequently imposed on farmers. Sufficient buy-in from particular groups of farmers has been identified to anticipate the continuation of the Irrigation Improvement Projects in such conditions.
In order to understand gender issues on irrigated agriculture two case studies were carried out in two contrasting areas in the old and the new lands of Lower Egypt, which have strikingly different characteristics in terms of landownership, gender roles, labour supply and demand, irrigation technology, and social control.
Activities at the meso level (~200 ha) have focused on detailed monitoring of an area comprising 12 collective pump stations located between Mares el Gamal canal and its Bashair branch. These pumps were recently installed (IIIMP project) and the way water management practices have changed was documented. The water level and salinity in the canal and 20 pumps were monitored with data loggers to assess the patterns of use of these stations; water quality has also been monitored in the subsurface drainage system, in the soil itself, and at the outlet of the drain which collects return flows from the area. Results illustrate and emphasize the high spatial and temporal variability of sub-surface and superficial drainage water.
A further ongoing activity has focused on the management of branch canals (secondary canals), and in particular the actual and possible roles of branch canal water user associations (BCWUAs). This also links with an (summary) analysis, at a higher level, of the Integrated Water Management Districts recently established in the Meet Yazid command area. Most of the associations were found to be inactive since the initial impulse by the government has not been followed by an empowerment of these associations. Their possible role in water management (e.g. enforcing the rotation) and in constituting an interface between individual farmers and district officers has not been forthcoming. Where this has been the case, to a limited extent, this happened to be linked to the positive attitude of specific ministry officers, but such dynamics are difficult to sustain in a context where staff are rotated.
At the macro level, research activities included: (1) a general survey of salinity in the drainage system, including 300 measurement points, revealing the spatial distribution of salt, the linkages with soil type, the gradient along each canal, and the levels of salinity in the drains from which farmers abstract water. Results clearly show that the accumulation of salts in the northern end of the Delta is due to continued mobilization of salts in the soil profile in that area and to the interception of salty groundwater (upward seepage), much more than to concentration by successive reuses; (2) a general survey on individual pumping from main and secondary drains, concluded that 2000–3000 pumping points were operational, mostly in the area north of Kafr el Sheikh, and (3) a survey on wells revealed that the use of groundwater is much more widespread than previously anticipated (reaching densities of one well per 1.5 ha), that a majority of wells were collective, and that investment was motivated by water shortages, poor water quality, or conflicts. Conjunctive use has implications on crop choice possibilities at the farm level, but may incur changes in water management rules at the system level, and have impact on the overall water balance of the delta and seawater intrusion in the delta aquifer.
Three activities examined aquaculture: the first focusing on the economics of the observed shift between crop cultivation on the one hand and aquaculture on the other, in order to understand the respective dynamics of crop and fish production; the second analyzing in detail the economics of fish production in the aquaculture area; and the third monitoring fish and water management practices and at a higher level, calculating in particular their salt and water balances.
￼The aquaculture sector as a whole is under ￼increasing pressure. The critical factors impacting the sector are high price and low quality of fish feed, poor quality fish fry, poor water quality, lack of access to capital, high fuel costs, and declining fish prices among many others. The variability in economic returns of the various aquaculture systems is also assessed.
Activities related to the understanding of the water and salt balance of the delta, although largely curtailed because of the changes in project duration and funding, have identified the need to better monitor the salt load (electric conductivity) of water samples and the water levels upstream and downstream of the main drainage pump stations (so that volumes pumped out to the sea can be better assessed), and to account for the reuse of drainage water downstream of those pump stations. Another very important component of the water balance is that of the delta aquifer. Based on the available data on the changes of groundwater salinity, it is not possible to ascertain whether there is a de-stocking of the aquifer (i.e. intrusion of saline groundwater) or not. Because of the boom in groundwater use identified it is recommended to improve the monitoring network of both the static water table level and groundwater salinity in the Delta.";"George, Biju Alummoottil

"mel:20.500.11766/8746";"Identifying major causes for gully erosion in sloping olive orchards by field mapping";"";"In the Mediterranean mountain areas of NW Syria, land degradation is a serious problem (Masri et al, 2005). Olive orchards dominate the landscape in Afrin area, and olive oil represents the most important cash income source for rural communities in this area. However, olive yields in many orchards have been decreasing steadily over the last 20 years. Low return to labour has resulted in livelihood insecurity, increased reliance on off-farm labour, and out-migration.
The major reason for the yield decline is the severe land degradation taking place in this region. Deforestation, expansion of olive production into steeper areas, and inappropriate land management accelerated the rate of soil. Especially the replacement of mule tillage by the cheaper tractor tillage during the 1970’s has caused an acceleration of the rate of land degradation. At the hills of Afrin District, the widespread presence of ephemeral and permanent gullies is a clear indicator of the severity of this problem. (Up-and-down) tractor tillage not only moves down sizable amounts of soil during every tillage run, but the consequent vertical furrows promote water-induced soil erosion and gully formation. Gullies are formed by concentrated surface runoff which acts as a cutting agent (Geyik, 1986). It is not exceptional to see that the parent material is surfacing, indicating a complete loss of the surface soil layer.
In recognition that gullies are mere symptoms of ongoing degradation rather than the cause of degradation itself (Stocking et al, 2001), the main focus of this study was to identify the causes of gully systems. Understanding these causes is an essential requirement for developing effective soil conservation strategies (Morgan , 1995). Other objectives were the mapping of gully systems, testing a methodology for meso-scale survey of gully systems, and capacity building of extension agents. In the study area, there were two dominant soil types: red soils are usually formed on pure limestone (Luvisols on deeper soils, and Cambisols on more shallow soils), white soils are usually formed on clayey limestones or marls (Regosols or Cambisols).";"Masri, Z.

"mel:20.500.11766/5164";"Assessing the impacts of livestock production on biodiversity in rangeland ecosystems";"";"Biodiversity in rangelands is decreasing, due to intense utilization
for livestock production and conversion of rangeland into cropland;
yet the outlook of rangeland biodiversity has not been
considered in view of future global demand for food. Here we
assess the impact of future livestock production on the global
rangelands area and their biodiversity. First we formalized existing
knowledge about livestock grazing impacts on biodiversity,
expressed in mean species abundance (MSA) of the original
rangeland native species assemblages, through metaanalysis of
peer-reviewed literature. MSA values, ranging from 1 in natural
rangelands to 0.3 in man-made grasslands, were entered in the
IMAGE-GLOBIO model. This model was used to assess the impact
of change in food demand and livestock production on future
rangeland biodiversity. The model revealed remarkable regional
variation in impact on rangeland area and MSA between two
agricultural production scenarios. The area of used rangelands
slightly increases globally between 2000 and 2050 in the baseline
scenario and reduces under a scenario of enhanced uptake of
resource-efficient production technologies increasing production
[high levels of agricultural knowledge, science, and technology
(high-AKST)], particularly in Africa. Both scenarios suggest a global
decrease in MSA for rangelands until 2050. The contribution of
livestock grazing to MSA loss is, however, expected to diminish
after 2030, in particular in Africa under the high-AKST scenario.
Policies fostering agricultural intensification can reduce the overall
pressure on rangeland biodiversity, but additional measures,
addressing factors such as climate change and infrastructural development,
are necessary to totally halt biodiversity loss.";"Alkemade, Rob

"mel:20.500.11766/8041";"Comparing Two Methods of Soil Data Interpretation to Improve the Reliability of Land Suitability Evaluation";"";"Sustainable management of limited land and water resources is urgently needed to meet the increasing demand for food and to protect the environment. Land suitability analysis is a prerequisite in assessing and proposing sustainable land use alternatives for an area. Soil data are usually available at different levels of detail and stored in various forms, usually soil maps and/or soil observations. Soil data interpretation methods control the reliability of land suitability evaluation results. This has a serious effect on the reliability of the suitability maps, the subsequent land use decisions, and environmental modeling. This study examines the reliability of land suitability mapping using different methods of soil data interpretation – the average of land characteristics for field observations within soil map units (point-in-polygon) and spatial interpolation using field observations only (proximity to points). The degree of agreement between the two methods depends on the type of land utilization – rainfed barley (86%), open range (85%), improved range (75%), drip irrigated vegetables (69%), and drip irrigated trees (59%). This results from the difference in the limiting land characteristic that determines the suitability of each land utilization type and the pattern of spatial variation of each land characteristic in the field. Suitability maps for adaptable (indigenous) crops (such as barley and range crops), which require minimum farming inputs, are generally more accurate because they tolerate a wider range of variability. The interpolation method was more efficient in detecting the spatial distribution and extreme values of limiting land characteristics, resulting in more accurate suitability maps. Therefore, when detailed soil maps are not available, field observations could be used to derive suitability maps using an exact interpolation method.";"Sultan, K A

"mel:20.500.11766/8821";"A gender Analysis Perspective for Improved Livelihoods in the Karkheh River Basin";"";"This study on gender and livelihood aims to find new ways of improving the incomes of rural households, based on the role of women in agricultural production and the division of labor in socioeconomic activities between men and women. It targets eight villages in two regions: Merek (Kermanshah Province) and Honam (Lorestan Province), and was carried out through conducting a social survey (quantitative research) and a participatory rural appraisal - PRA- (qualitative research). The results from qualitative and quantitative research were integrated.
The study focused on gender roles in agricultural activities; women’s access, control and share of income; and their perceptions and impressions of ways of improving their family livelihood. Theories and overviews on gender and development, gender inequality, feminism, and other issues, are summarized in the study.
The study revealed that the roles played by women in the agricultural field, concentrated on seeding, planting, weeding, harvesting and packing; leaving operating machinery and marketing to men. In the field of animal production, women’s roles concentrated on milking, rather than cleaning or feeding. Handicrafts, however, were mainly women’s activities, with very little participation from men. Despite the major role women play in the provision of household income, the patriarchal culture in rural families leaves fewer opportunities for women to take part in decision-making and to have access to resources. 
To improve their livelihoods, rural families need training (informal) and education (formal) to help establish and develop businesses and income-generating activities using the small savings of local people and credit from the government.";"Neffati, Mohamed

"mel:20.500.11766/8826";"Improving water and land productivity in rainfed systems";"";"Climate change has led to more severe conditions throughout the world as well as in Morocco. In general, rainfall has declined and average temperatures have increased. These new rainfall patterns are threatening water supplies. Fluctuations and reductions in annual rainfall have led to severe and frequent droughts throughout the Central and West Asia and North Africa region. Consequently, water resources have become scarce. Increasing municipal and industrial demand for water has resulted in steadily decreasing allocations for agriculture. The major agricultural use of water is for irrigation, which is therefore most affected by decreasing supplies. Therefore, innovations are needed to increase efficiency in the use of the water that is available. The main objective of the project is the adoption by farming communities of strategies and tested technologies that optimize the conjunctive use of rainwater and scarce water resources in supplemental irrigation systems for improved and sustainable water productivity in rainfed areas. This requires the development of technological, institutional and policy innovations, using an integrated and participative approach, which is the specific objective of the research activities conducted at the benchmark site in Morocco.
The project started in 2004 with an overview of previous research and on-farm trials on irrigation water management and water-use efficiency in Morocco. This helped identify the potential technologies to be tested. Then, based on agreed criteria, the benchmark site at Tadla was chosen and characterized by analyzing existing bio-physical data together with socioeconomic information collected during meetings and two participatory workshops, at which farmers and farmers’ associations were the main participants. The participatory workshops also helped identify the two representative communities of the Tadla irrigated area and the group of farmers with whom the on-farm trials were conducted. Research, dissemination and capacity-building activities were conducted from 2004/05 to 2007/08.
To test and evaluate new techniques and technologies that can improve water productivity under supplemental irrigation systems, various on-farm trials were conducted.";"Karrou, Mohammed

"mel:20.500.11766/8049";"Contour Laser Guiding for the Mechanized “Vallerani” Micro-catchment Water Harvesting Systems";"";"Mechanized construction of micro-catchments for water harvesting (WH) was successfully tested in the Badia (dry rangeland) areas in Syria and Jordan, using the “Vallerani” plow, model Delfino (50 MI/CM), manufactured by Nardi, Italy. The plow was able to construct intermittent and continuous contour ridges, and could potentially be used to rehabilitate degraded rangelands. However, one major issue for large-scale implementation is the high cost and time required to manually identify contours for the plow to follow. Most existing auto-guiding systems, as usually used in road construction and agricultural land leveling, were expensive or impractical. The objective, therefore, was to add, adapt, and evaluate an auto-guiding system to enable a tractor to follow contours without demarcation through conventional surveying. A low-cost Contour Laser Guiding (CLG) system, with specifications that suit the contour ridging in undulating topographic conditions of dry rangelands, was chosen, adapted, mounted, and tested, under actual field conditions. The system consisted mainly of a portable laser transmitter and a tractor-mounted receiver, connected to a guidance display panel. The system was field-tested on 95 ha of land where the system capacity was determined under different terrains, slopes (1-8%), and ridge spacings (4-12 m). The easy adaptation and implementation of the CLG to the “Vallerani” unit tripled the system capacity, improved efficiency and precision, and substantially reduced the cost of constructing micro-catchments for WH. The system is recommended for large-scale rangeland rehabilitation projects in the dry areas, not only in West Asia, but worldwide.";"Gammoh, I.A.

"mel:20.500.11766/8824";"Rehabilitation and Integrated Management of Dry Rangelands Environments with Water Harvesting";"";"The Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region encompasses large areas of arid and semi-arid zones. These zones may be defined as areas where rainfall, relative to the level of evapotranspiration, is inadequate to sustain reliable crop production. Most of the arid and semi-arid zones of the CWANA region are rangelands and are characterized by wide variability in rainfall and temperature. Droughts are common, resulting in low forage production and crop productivity as well as water scarcity.
In the CWANA region, the increase in human population has increased the demand for meat, in turn causing a major increase in livestock numbers, especially sheep. The escalating demand for forage
by grazing animals exceeds the potential productivity of grazing resources. This has resulted in increasing barley cultivation by taking lands from steppe and desert rangelands.
The increase in grazing pressure and cultivation of traditional and fragile grazing lands has led to severe degradation of these resources.
The main limiting factors to growth of plants in the desert rangelands are low precipitation, and poor soil quality. Maximizing the use of water runoff by making microcatchments and macrocatchments might be
practical to increase forage production, which is essential to feed the sheep and goat flocks of pastoral societies in these areas. Since the Jordanian Badia is representative of the vast dry environments
found in WANA, it was chosen as a benchmark site (with satellite sites in Saudi Arabia and Libya) to develop and disseminate water harvesting (WH) approaches and techniques to capture and efficiently utilize rainwater runoff in more productive and sustainable agricultural systems, which are to be integrated and adopted by people in the drier of the CWANA environments.
The project started in 2004 with the analysis of the existing and collected bio-physical and socioeconomic data, participative workshops, meetings, and field visits in the Jordanian Badia. Based on all this information and on agreed criteria, the benchmark site in Jordan was chosen and characterized. This site is represented by the two watersheds of Al-Majidyya and Mharib. In these sites, different research, dissemination, and capacity-building activities related to WH were conducted during 2004/05–2007/08.";"Karrou, Mohammed
