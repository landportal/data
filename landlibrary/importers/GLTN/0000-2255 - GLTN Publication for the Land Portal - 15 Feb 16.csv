This challenge deeply affects the implementation of projects, programmes and activities, and the ability to sustain them or to build on and take them further. Effective, long-term capacity cannot be developed easily, haphazardly, or quickly. Until recently, developing capacity was seen mainly as the transfer of knowledge and skills from the ""experts"" to development partners; the word it has most often been equated with is ""training"". A welcome shift from this perspective is underway. Capacity development is increasingly recognised as a complex process that requires an integrated approach, designed to deal with particular situations in a comprehensive manner. 
An important part of this recognition is that successful and sustainable implementation depends on multiple factors, including the social and political context in which it occurs, the structure and influence of the various organisations and individuals involved, ownership of development ideas and aims, the priorities on the ground, and the extent of existing leadership abilities, skills and commitment of the people involved.",http://gltn.net/index.php/publications/publications/publications-list/send/2-gltn-documents/130-the-gltn-capacity-development-strategy-eng-2013

En dépit des avancées dans le domaine des droits des femmes, ceux qui concernent la terre et la sécurité du régime foncier ne sont pas également répartis entre les deux sexes dans bien des régions du monde. Cela va à l’encontre des droits humains reconnus par les conventions internationales, tout en ayant des effets néfastes sur les ménages et sur l’économie. Lorsqu’elles touchent à la terre, les questions d’égalité des sexes deviennent plus complexes. Elles font intervenir les sphères sociale et culturelle et remettent en cause des structures de pouvoir profondément enracinées. Dans le même temps, nous savons bien que si un outil foncier doit produire tous ses effets, il doit dépasser le domaine purement technique pour prendre aussi en compte certaines dimensions sociales, comme celle du genre. La présente brochure expose les travaux que le Réseau mondial des outils fonciers (GLTN) a pour le moment réalisés en rapport avec la conception de nouveaux instruments, ou l’évaluation de ceux qui existent, et ce dans la perspective de l’égalité des sexes. Le cadre d’évaluation de la dimension du genre détaille les moyens de décider si un outil foncier de grande échelle favorise suffisamment l’égalité des sexes, en signalant les aspects sur lesquels il faut encore travailler ainsi que les points d’accès qui permettent à un outil donné de bénéficier autant aux femmes qu’aux hommes.",http://www.gltn.net/index.php/publications/publications/publications-list/send/2-gltn-documents/245-gender-evaluation-criteria-for-large-scale-land-tools-fr

"Property Theory,Metaphors and the Continuum of Land Rights",Michael Barry,,ENG,2015,Report,Access to Land and Tenure Security,UN-Habitat/GLTN,UN-Habitat/GLTN,"The following recommendations are made in this report:
1. The continuum of land rights is a metaphor, not a theory. A metaphor can be applied in a number of theoretical contexts, whereas a theory has an ideological perspective.
2. When applying the continuum, establish a position on the role of the state and then define the terms formal and informal. The state cannot always be the sole steward and arbiter over land tenure, but a number of documents imply this. Associated with this issue is that the rights recognized by the state are considered formal rights and other rights, such as customary rights, are often considered to be informal. Customary systems are hardly informal and a number of countries recognize customary tenure systems.
3. When using the continuum of land rights for analysis purposes consider also adopting the metaphors of a constellation of land interests and the bundle of rights to complement the continuum of land rights metaphor in order to develop a broader analytical framework based on three main sub-systems, the ideological, legal and actual relations. Further, develop frameworks for specific applications or purposes of the continuum, particularly at country level. 4. The current graphic needs to be revised. What might be considered is having no standard graphic at all, but to use graphical aids that are suited to a particular situation.",http://gltn.net/index.php/publications/publications/publications-list/send/2-gltn-documents/2233-property-theory-metaphors-and-the-continuum-of-land-rights
