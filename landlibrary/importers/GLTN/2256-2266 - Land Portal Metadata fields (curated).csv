Learning Route: Innovative Ideas on Securing Resource Land Rights through inclusive business models: The case of Uganda;GLTN-2256;;Global Land Tool Network;"The Learning Route (LR) is capacity development deliverable of the TSLI-ESA project implemented by UN-Habitat through GLTN, funded by IFAD. It aims at enhancing awareness, knowledgeand skills of staff from IFAD supported projects, programs and partners in application of geo-spatial technologies in securing land and natural resource tenure and on innovation on inclusive business models (IBMs).
PROCASUR Corporation and the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) partnered in organising a Learning Route to put a pitch at the importance of inclusive business models (IBMs), securing land rights through mapping using the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) and Women Access to Land. The training
was implemented between the 3rd and the 10th of December 2015 under the banner: ""Innovative Ideas on Securing Resource and Land Rights
through Inclusive Business Models: the Case of Uganda"". Two cases were visited: the Vegetable Oil Development Programme – Phase II (VODP-II)
and Kawacom Limited.
Twelve participants from East and Southern Africa participated, discussing Agricultural Investments, Inclusive Business Models and land tenure security.";http://gltn.net/index.php/publications/publications/other-documents/send/3-other-documents/2256-learning-route-innovative-ideas-on-securing-resource-land-rights-through-inclusive-business-models-the-case-of-uganda;Reports & Research;land rights, land investments;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land Use, Management & Investment;2016/03;http://gltn.net/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/Learning%20route.JPG;English;"Global Land Tool Network; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Procasur";Uganda;Global Land Tool Network;Global Land Tool Network

Regional Learning Workshop on Land and Natural Resources Tenure Security in East and Southern Africa Final Proceedings, 30 June - 2 July 2015, Nairobi, Kenya;GLTN-2259;Solomon Mkumbwa, Tervil Tom Okoko, Clarissa Augustinus, Isaac Bekalo, Harold Liversage, John Ochola, Hellen Nyamweru;;"This publication is the summary of the proceedings of the Regional Learning Workshop on ‘Land and Natural Resources Tenure Security’ held in Nairobi, Kenya from 30th June -2nd July 2015 as jointly organized by UN-Habitat/Global Land Tool Network and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 
The aim of the workshop was to deepen the understanding of land and natural resources tenure security issues and to identify opportunities to strengthen land tenure security and land access of the rural poor and marginalized groups in sub- Saharan Africa. During the workshop, participants shared their own challenges and experiences for strengthening security of land and natural resource tenure of poor people and vulnerable groups.
The meeting served as an avenue to discuss existing good practices and appropriate land tools and their possible applications to specifi c country contexts. The participants also identifi ed opportunities to scale up lessons learning and sharing, pilot new approaches and tools and strengthen policy dialogues.";http://www.gltn.net/index.php/publications/publications/other-documents/send/2-gltn-documents/2259-regional-learning-workshop-on-land-and-natural-resources-tenure-security-in-east-and-southern-africa-final-proceedings-30-june-2-july-2015-nairobi-kenya;Reports & Research;security of tenure (land), land access, land ownership, land policies;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Access to Land & Tenure Security;2015/10;http://gltn.net/images/IFAD_july_report.JPG;English;"Global Land Tool Network; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); United Nations Human Settlements Programme";Eastern Africa, Southern Africa;© United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), 2015;Global Land Tool Network

The selected case studies from fifteen countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America ensure not only a eographic balance but they also represent countries with different socio-economic and land-related histories and that have followed different pathways. The studies’ key findings underline the still precarious state of tenure security in many countries. The findings also show best practices for legal and administrative reforms that have generated incentives for long-term investment in land, or incentives to include the poor more comprehensively. 
Led by the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) the publication is a joint endeavour with the Chair of Land Management at the Technische Universität München (TUM) and the Land Management Sector Project of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

Documenting Experiences on STDM Piloting in St. Lucia & St. Vincent and The Grenadines;GLTN-2261;Charisse Griffith-Charles, Asad Mohammed, Sunil Lalloo, Victoria Quinlan, Stefanie Freccia;;"Land administration is defined as the acquisition, maintenance and dissemination of information on the ownership, value and use of land. This information is necessary to support land policy implementation. Besides being complete and current, land administration systems – including the information contained within the systems and the processes used for their establishment and maintenance - should ideally be transparent, accessible, simple and low-cost to efficiently and effectively allocate land fairly to citizens.
The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) software is a pro-poor tool for land administration. It may be used to record the interests of people who occupy and use land but who do not have formal freehold title and who would therefore be left out of conventional land information systems. The STDM has been designed to record these interests simply, quickly and cheaply in a digital database, which therefore increases the flexibility, accessibility and usefulness of the data. This report documents the experiences of piloting the STDM in Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.";http://www.gltn.net/index.php/publications/publications/other-documents/send/2-gltn-documents/2267-documenting-experiences-on-stdm-piloting-in-saint-lucia-st-vincent-and-the-grenadines;Reports & Research;land administration, land information systems, land titling, customary tenure, security of tenure (land), development agencies;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land Use, Management & Investment;2016/01;http://gltn.net/images/160318_OECS_web1_Page_01.jpg;English;"Global Land Tool Network; United Nations Human Settlements Programme";Saint Vincent and the Grenadines;© United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), 2012;Global Land Tool Network
NRC: The Importance of Addressing Housing, Land and Property (HLP);GLTN-2262;;Norwegian Refugee Council;"A new report by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) outlines eight reasons why it is important to address HLP issues from the outset of a humanitarian response, including:
Saving lives, preventing further displacement and human rights violations
Adapting humanitarian response to complex urban environments
Ensuring equal access to humanitarian assistance
Promoting access to justice in crises contexts and contributing towards durable solutions
Addressing loss of land and inability to return to land and homes after disasters
Supporting women’s recovery through the protection of their HLP rights
HLP as a tool for conflict prevention and peace building
Supporting local systems and bridging transition / development gap 
Following collaboration with the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to housing, the paper also explains how the international human rights framework can inform both disaster and conflict response, enhancing protection for those affected. 
A Roundtable held in Geneva on the 2nd March 2016 provided the opportunity to discuss how to tackle HLP challenges from a practitioners’ perspective. Key highlights and recommendations from the event have been incorporated into the report, which proposes how the global HLP Area of Responsibility (AoR), co-chaired by NRC and IFRC, and its partners can take these into operational responses in the future.
