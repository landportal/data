nust:10628/361;The cost of land registration: A case study of cost efficiency in Namibia.;;"In the light of the global discussion on

reducing public and private expenditure on

cadastral processes and services, this

article reviews the transaction costs of

land registration, based on data gathered in

Namibia. The data show a large

differentiation in the types of costs

incurred in the process, as well as various

levels of cost recovery. In addition, the

degree to which delays in the operational

registration processes influence the total

cost to land developers and landowners is

reviewed.";"De Vries, Walter

nust:10628/360;Are urban land tenure regulations in Namibia the solution or the problem?;;"Land tenure in Namibia is regulated by a variety of Acts, some of which date back to as far as 1937, and some of which are

yet to be approved by Cabinet. This variety of Acts makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of land administration as a

whole, and the appropriateness of coercive instruments with regards to urban land tenure in particular. In this article we

evaluate how urban land tenure regularization practices are conducted in Namibia, and to compare new formal procedures,

designed to address problems of efficiency and efficacy, to older existing procedures, supposedly not efficient or effective.

This evaluation uses a theoretical framework of (Pritchett and Woolcock, 2004) , which deals with public service delivery

and transaction-intensive services. Applying this framework for a comparative analysis of 5 different land subdivision

practices – each relying on a different land-related act - we conclude that the degree of regulation and regularization is

perhaps not so much a solution for urban land tenure problems but perhaps more of a problem in itself.";"De Vries, Walter

nust:10628/617;Land reform;;A lot of aspects are commonly subsumed under the concept land reform. These range from redistribution to tenure and agrarian reform. What do these different concepts mean? Agrarian reform: this is the broadest term and refers to attempts to change the agrarian structure of a country. It typically includes land reform, tenure, the reform of agricultural support systems and the reform of the credit system. Land reform: interventions to change the pattern of land ownership or agrarian structure through a process of redistributing land Tenure reform: tenure refers to the system governing access to land defining rights and obligations. Tenure reform refers to reforming these rules to achieve improved tenure security or equity. While land reform involves moving some people off the land in order to improve access to such land by other, tenure reforms leaves people holding the same land but with different rights.;Werner, Wolfgang;;"Namibia University of Science and Technology;Integrated Land Management Institute";Namibia University of Science and Technology;2018-12-31;en;"land;land reform;agriculture;agrarian reform";;;;;http://ir.nust.na/handle/10628/617;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2301/retrieve;;;;;
nust:10628/616;Urban land delivery;;There has been rapid growth in urban populations in Namibia (Pendleton et al, 2014). This growth is amongst predominantly amongst less educated, poorer migrants from rural areas in search of opportunities in urban areas. From the data available the estimated shortfall of either titled land or houses appears to be above 150 000 and increasing at about 11 000 per year (Weber, 2017). This trend of urbanisation is occurring not only in Namibia but across the world, particularly now in developing countries. Continued urban migration should be encouraged, as even though new urban migrants are poor, by and large their lives are better in urban areas. However, the delivery of titled land in urban areas in Namibia has been hamstrung by several legislative and regulatory procedures with a number of negative consequences (De Vries, 2009).;Mendelsohn, Martin;;"Namibia University of Science and Technology;Integrated Land Management Institute";Namibia University of Science and Technology;2018-12-31;en;"land delivery;land reform;informal settlements;land";Urban Tenure;Access to Land & Tenure Security;;;http://ir.nust.na/handle/10628/616;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2299/retrieve;;;;;

Namibia is in line with the Fit-For-Purpose (FFP) land administration approach which is

developed in order to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at national and

local level in developing countries by providing tenure security to poor people and creating

country-wide land recordation systems. The FFP approach is based on a Minimum Viable

Product focusing on the specific local tenure security needs, flexibility on survey accuracy,

legal and institutional frameworks and an incremental improvement as a foundation for

further development. The study is based on a literature study of the SDGs, the FFP approach

and the FLTS in Namibia. The literature study is based on contemporary theories on land

administration and how access to tenure security can contribute to poverty alleviation. The

study indicates that certain elements of the FLTS are complying with the characteristics of the

FFP approach and thus has potential to contribute to fulfilling the SDGs in Namibia. There is

however a need for further in-depth academic research.";Christensen, Åse;;"Namibia University of Science and Technology;Integrated Land Management Institute";Namibia University of Science and Technology;2017-04-30;en;"development;land;land tenure;sustainable development;land tenure systems;development agencies";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;Reports & Research;http://ir.nust.na/handle/10628/581;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2198/retrieve;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2207/retrieve;;;;

nust:10628/85;Optical remote sensing in support of eutrophication monitoring in the southern North Sea.;;"Spring mean and maximum chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations are main factors to determine the eutrophication status of the Belgian waters as agreed within OSPAR in 2002. Other important assessment parameters to measure the degree of nutrient enrichment - the amounts of inorganic

phosphate and nitrogen in winter - appeared to be above thresholds for most measurements performed in the period 1974-2002. As the standard in situ monitoring programme does not give a clear picture of the temporal and spatial distribution of chl a, it is logical to complement these measurements with optical remote sensing. However, chlorophyll concentrations derived from sensors such as SeaWiFS are unreliable in the Case 2 waters of this region because of high particulate and dissolved yellow substance absorption. Another important limitation of ocean colour sensors is the amount of useful images due to cloud cover. The combination of data from different ocean colour sensors in order to enable a better temporal coverage might be hampered by the different chlorophyll retrieval algorithms used. This study compares different global chl a algorithms (MODIS, SeaWiFS, MERIS) as well as a turbid water algorithm for the Southern North Sea. This is done by running the different algorithms on in situ reflectance spectra collected at 107 stations in the period 2001-2002 over the Southern North Sea and comparing them with in situ chl a concentrations, as well as by running the algorithms on a MERIS image of the 29th of July 2002.

the Southern North Sea are assessed.";"De Cauwer, Vera

nust:10628/586;Leasehold as a Vehicle for Economic Development;;Secure tenure and registered land rights are widely believed to be necessary for access to credit, well functioning land markets and economic development. As a result Namibia introduced long term leasehold rights over communal and commercial land for resettlement purposes in order to address preindependence imbalances in land holdings. The purpose is to bring the resettled beneficiaries into the mainstream of the economy, but this has not happened. The research analysed the institutional framework for resettlement allocations and the transaction costs in order to understand the impact of leaseholds on the beneficiaries ability to access credit and mobilise investments. The findings suggest that the transaction cost were low when compared with similar transaction internationally, but high in comparison with the production value of the parcels of land. The lack of resources available to the beneficiaries and their resultant inability to service loans is a major contributor to the lack of economic development. Poor access to information on the registration requirements for leases, combined with the requirements from financial institutions and the lack of a market for leasehold rights meant that beneficiaries are not able to register their leases in order participate meaningfully in economic development.;"Werner, Wolfgang

nust:10628/473;Potential, realised, future distribution and environmental suitability for pterocarpus angolensis DC in southern Africa.;;"The deciduous tree species Pterocarpus angolensis occurs in the dry woodlands of southern Africa and grows under a broad range of environmental conditions. It is threatened by overharvesting due to its valuable timber (Blood wood, Kiaat) and by land use changes. Information on the most suitable environmental conditions for the species is often old and anecdotal, while available data on its occurrence refer to range extent and not to distribution.

Species distribution models (SDM) could provide more accurate information on distribution and environmental requirements and thereby assist sustainable management of this tree species. Maxent models were developed to estimate the potential, realised and future distribution of P.

angolensis and to identify detailed environmental requirements. Occurrences data of the species were sourced from herbaria and other published sources; environmental data from global GIS databases. Relevant environmental predictors were selected through a jack-knife test of the first

model runs. The addition of information on competing species, fires and deforestation was tested to determine realised distribution. Model quality was evaluated with an independent presence-absence dataset. The model was projected with two different climate change scenarios to study their effect on the distribution by 2080.

Results show that a potential distribution map can be obtained with good discrimination of the presence of the species (AUC 0.83) and fairly good calibration (correlation coefficient 0.61). Range extent and environmental requirements are more detailed than those described in literature. The distribution of the species is mainly influenced by the amount of summer rainfall,

by the minimum temperature in winter and by temperature seasonality. Potential and realised distributions are very similar, with Madagascar as major exception where the species can grow but does not occur. Adding the fire history of the last 13 years or the distribution maps of potentially competing species as predictor variables did not improve the distribution model. It did illustrate that P.angolensis is mainly found in areas with annual fire frequency below 45%

and that only a few of the tested species show signs of competition. Using a forest cover map improved the realised distribution slightly (Kappa coefficient 0.64). Climate change can decrease the species range considerably, especially in the west, threatening species existence in Namibia and Botswana. On the other hand, the species’ occurrence is predicted to increase in

Its thematic approach seeks to facilitate multi-disciplinary research projects that will reflect the wide range of skills existing in the School of Natural Resources and Spatial Sciences (SNRSS) at the Polytechnic of Namibia (PoN). It is unique in that it has all land related disciplines in one School and is therefore well placed to become a leading research centre.;"Bayer, Charl-Thom H.

nust:10628/577;Participatory land delivery processes in Gobabis: the case of Freedom Square.;;The project in question refers to the case of 'Freedom Square' in Gobabis, which is a cooperation between the Municipality of Gobabis and the Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia (SDFN), the Namibia Housing Action Group (NHAG), the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST), and other international parties. The project is motivated by an agenda of 'inclusive cities': through close collaboration with existing residents in the area, the process of land delivery is expedited and turned into an exercise of making inhabitants drivers in the improvement of living conditions.;Harris, Braam;;"Namibia University of Science and Technology;Integrated Land Management Institute";Namibia University of Science and Technology;2016-08-31;en;"land delivery;land;sustainable development;capacity building";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;;;;http://ir.nust.na/handle/10628/577;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2182/retrieve;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2191/retrieve;;;;
nust:10628/315;Balancing the technical and social contexts of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI).;;"One special characteristic of spatial data is that they can be shared to be used for many purposes other than the one for which they were initially produced. To facilitate their efficient sharing and reuse, they need to be properly managed in the form of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). This study

argues that developing a successful SDI must be seen as a socio-technical, rather than a purely technical exercise. It urges that SDI practitioners need to understand the significance of human and societal issues as much as technical issues, all of which contribute to the successful implementation of SDI.";Nangolo, Esther N.;;Namibia University of Science and Technology;Namibia University of Science and Technology;2011-12-31;en;"open data;geographical information systems;capacity building";;;;Journal Articles & Books;http://ir.nust.na/handle/10628/315;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/855/retrieve;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/1867/retrieve;;;;

nust:10628/216;Seaborne measurements of near infrared water-leaving reflectance: The similarity spectrum for turbid waters.;;"Theory and seaborne measurements are presented for the near infrared (NIR: 700–900 nm) water-leaving reflectance in turbid waters. According to theory, the shape of the NIR spectrum is determined largely by pure water absorption and is thus almost invariant. A ‘‘similarity’’ NIR reflectance spectrum is defined by normalization at 780 nm. This spectrum is calculated from seaborne reflectance measurements and is compared with that derived from laboratory water absorption measurements. Factors influencing the shape of the similarity spectrum are analyzed

theoretically and by radiative transfer simulations. These simulations show that the similarity spectrum is valid for waters ranging from moderately turbid (e.g., water-leaving reflectance at 780 nm of order 1024 or total

suspended matter concentration of order 0.3 g m23) to extremely turbid (e.g., reflectance at 780 nm of order 1021 or total suspended matter of order 200 g m23). Measurement uncertainties are analyzed, and the air-sea interface correction is shown to be critical for low reflectances. Applications of the NIR similarity spectrum to atmospheric correction of ocean color data and to the quality control of seaborne, airborne, and spaceborne reflectance measurements in turbid waters are outlined.";"Ruddick, Kevin

nust:10628/619;Communal land;;Communal land is one of the land tenure systems in Namibia, the other being freehold land tenure system. At independence in 1990,Namibia resolved to retain communal land on the basis that majority of the population derived their livelihoods from communal land.Notwithstanding the increasing urban population in the country since independence, the majority of the Namibian population still lives in the communal areas, and many of the urban-based population continue to have close relations in rural areas. Similarly, while sources of livelihoods in the communal areas have been diversified, communal land continues to serve as an important basis of people’s livelihoods.;Nghitevelekwa, Romie;;"Namibia University of Science and Technology;Integrated Land Management Institute";Namibia University of Science and Technology;2018-12-31;en;"land;land reform;agriculture;agrarian reform;common lands";Indigenous & Community Land Rights;;;;http://ir.nust.na/handle/10628/619;http://ir.nust.na/rest/bitstreams/2305/retrieve;;;;;

It furthermore includes protection against forced evictions, arbitrary interference with one’s home, and the right to determine one’s place of living.

Gertrude Mujoro, who discussed the matter with her fellow colleagues who brought the matter to the

attention of the leadership of the Teachers Union of Namibia (TUN). In 2014 the Trade Union Congress

of Namibia (TUCNA), the umbrella federation that TUN belongs to, developed a document titled

“TUCNA Development Policy Proposals” (TUCNA, 2014), which contains a section on housing. In line

with this mandate, Mahongora Kavihuha, Secretary General of TUN and TUCNA, approached the

Integrated Land Management Institute (ILMI) at the Namibia University of Science and Technology

(NUST), to establish an open collaboration around the topic. As a result, a series of workshops and

discussions between teachers and ILMI staff were held to explore housing possibilities for teachers in

Namibia.";"Guillermo, Delgado
