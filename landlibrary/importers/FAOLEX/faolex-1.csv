"LEX-FAOC152365";"The Second National Environmental Action Programme.";"The Second National Environmental Action Programme is a sectoral national programme of the Republic of Armenia applicable to the period 2008-2012. Its main objective is to provide a systematized package of environmental policy instruments to minimize the pressure on the natural environment.Among the measures aiming for environmental protection, the Programme pertains to management of various types of natural resources. Among them, it covers the issue of land resource management. In this area, the document provides for various measures, including (1) the revision of the classification principle of land resources, separating the notions of “land use categories” and “legal regime of land use”, thus improving the registration system of land fund and inputting new zoning system for land use and documentation for area planning; (2) enhancing the supervision over the land use and preservation by implementing national, regional, community project targeting land use and preservation; (3) reduction and prevention of land degradation, aiming at organization of anti-erosion, anti-land-sliding and ameliorative activities, implementation of measures for restoration (re-cultivation) of degraded lands, definition of principles for privatized agricultural land consolidation; (4) creation of Geographic Information Systems based on modern technologies with the application of environmental monitoring criteria; and (5) allocating lands located outside the administrative boundaries of the communities, transfer of powers to the communities to ensure the prevention of land degradation and biodiversity conservation.With regard to the ecosystem management, the Programme aims to (1) introduce biodiversity accounting, inventory and monitoring systems; (2) set quotes for bio-diversity use, assessment of human-induced and nature caused impact on the use of natural resources; (3) optimization of the Specially Protected Areas (SPA) system in line with modern approaches and principles; (4) in view of the long-pending idea of the communities on establishing community forests, to envisage reforestation of no less than 3,000 ha community territories by mean of attracting various financial sources and innovative financial mechanisms, which will at the same time specify active measures to fight fires and pests; (5) carry out an appropriate research to clarify the time-frame for implementing the measures as stipulated under the National Forest Programme of Armenia before 2012; (6) develop and implement pilot project on availability of genetic resources in the community and fair distribution of the benefits obtained from its use aiming to create prerequisites for conservation of Armenian genetic variety and balanced use of genetic resources.Finally, the Programme treats the issue of water management. In this area, it notes that one of the most important prerequisites of appropriate management of water resources is the assessment and classification of water reserves and resources of the Republic, which will in turn allow making decisions related to the expansion of the strategic water reserves and regulation of river flow. Among other important directions is the development of global water resource management, which will require elaboration of projects for surface and underground water resources monitoring based on the river basin approach. Another direction relates to definition and conservation of water ecosystems reservation zones (of sanitary conservation, flow formation, underwater conservation, water protection zones, ecotone, etc.), as well as the development of methodology for determining the volumes of ecological outlets on the basis of hydro-geographical characteristics.The state policy for environmental protection and reasonable use of natural resources is developed and implemented by the Ministry of Nature Protection of the Republic of Armenia. The functions assigned to the Ministry of Nature Protection are implemented by the structural and detached units of the ministry personnel and state non-profit organizations and companies established within the ministry system.

The rate assessed shall be subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Administration. As a general principle, each rate shall be made, levied and assessed partly on the valuation of the land without improvements and partly on the value of the improvements, unless the local authority determines that any rate shall be made, levied and assessed on the valuation of the land only or the improvements only. Exemptions from rates shall be made for immovable property: (a) vested in the Government; or (b) used exclusively throughout the year for public purposes. The local authority shall prepare and maintain an up-to-date list of all immovable property which is exempted from the payment of rates. For the purpose of assessing the rates, the local authority shall valuate all immovable property within its area. The valuation shall be entrusted to a valuer, who shall prepare a draft valuation roll containing: (a) the description of the land: (b) the area of the land; (c) the situation of the land; (d) the name of the owner; (e) the nature of the use of the land and improvements; (f) the value of the land without improvements; (g) the value of improvements; (h) the total improved value of the land; (i) a reference to any agricultural certificate granted in the terms of section 13, according to which the valuer may declare a property, used ""bona fide"" and exclusively for agricultural purposes, as being an agricultural land. The basis of the valuation shall be deemed the ordinary market price of the land.Further provisions concern inter alia: (a) the power of the valuer to entry and carry on inspections on the land; (b) the certification of valuation to owners; (c) the appointment of a valuation court by the Minister; (d) the hearing of objections; (e) the certification of valuation roll; (f) the purchase and inspection of valuation roll; (g) interim valuations. The treasurer shall be the collector of rates and, subject to section 32, may, under that title, sue for and recover all rates which are due and payable to the local authority. A penalty calculated according to the provisions of section 30 shall be added in respect of any rate remaining unpaid after the expiry of two months form the date on which such rate became due and payable. Sections 31 and 32 deal with the recovery of rates and the legal proceedings for recovery of rates. The registration of any transfer of immovable property is subject to the submission of a certificate, signed by the town clerk or treasurer, declaring that all rates in respect thereof have been paid. The certificate shall also cover any amount owing to the local authority by the owner by way of any fees or charges which may be payable, under any other law, in respect of the property. Miscellaneous provisions regard the following: returns of transfers of property; serving of notices and documents; evidence; recovery of cost of valuation; penalties for offences.The Act is completed by one Schedule, which is divided into four Parts. Part I contains a list of the areas to which the Act applies; Parts II, III and IV contain, respectively, model forms of the declaration of the valuer, the certification of valuer and the certificate of the valuation court.

For implementing this general objective the following specific objectives are contemplated: (1) promoting women’s participation in developing economic policies and managing the economy; (2) enhancing rural women’s equal access to and control over productive resources and services (land, oxen, extension, credit) in order to make them food secure and come out of the poverty trap; (3) improving the lives of pastoral women; (4) enhancing urban women's and disabled women’s access to and control over economic resources and services (land, credit, employment, training); (5) reducing women’s workload; and (6) providing special social and economic safety and security to poor urban and rural as well as disabled women.Among the specific objectives noted above, the objective two could be singled out. It provides for the following activities: (1) improving property right laws with more security, flexibility and transferability; (2) identifying, developing, and disseminating technologies that meet the special needs of women and contribute to reducing their poverty; (3) developing alternative livelihoods for poor and disabled women so that they get dependable income sources and are less susceptible to economic shocks; (4) providing poor women and women with disabilities with access to savings and credit mechanisms and institutions; (5) applying special considerations to enable poor women farmers’ access to extension services, increasing women extension workers, and promoting multi-package extension program responsive to area-specific production needs of rural poor women; and (6) establishing/strengthening micro-enterprises, new small businesses, cooperative enterprises, and other institutions that enhance women’s economic empowerment.For the implementation of objective three above i.e. improving the lives of pastoral women, the following activities are included in the Action Plan: undertake thorough study on the conditions of women in pastoral areas; improve pastoralist women’s access to and control over resources (cattle, cash, and other assets); develop special service packages for pastoral women (extension, education and training, health, credit, and others); and develop projects to reduce workload of pastoral women.Finally, under objective four above, these activities will be carried out: develop gender-sensitive policies and measures to empower women in technical, managerial and entrepreneurial fields; provide poor women and women with disability with entrepreneurial potentials, with access to savings and credit services; provide business services, training and access to markets, information and technology, to poor women; and review/amend laws and procedures governing operations of financial institutions to ensure provision of services to women and men on equal basis.Additionally, the Action Plan envisages a general objective to enhance the role and benefits of women in environmental management and protection. This is broken down into the following specific objectives: (1) promote women’s participation and empowerment at all levels; (2) increase women’s access to information, improved technology, and alternative livelihoods; (3) create strong institutions and institutional mechanisms that guide and support efforts to address gender and environment issues; (4) ensure adequate housing conditions, access to potable water, improved sanitation and fuel to urban and rural women; and (5) develop and implement guidelines on environmental management and women in pastoral areas.

"LEX-FAOC149709";"Zambia Vision 2030";"The National Long Term Vision 2030 (Vision 2030) is Zambia's first ever written long-term plan, expressing Zambians’ aspirations by the year 2030. The formulation process utilized both top-down and bottom-up approaches, where various stakeholders at both national and regional level were consulted.The Zambian people’s vision is to become “a prosperous middle income nation by 2030”. By 2030, Zambians, aspire to live in a strong and dynamic middle-income industrial nation that provides opportunities for improving the well being of all, embodying values of socioeconomic justice, underpinned by the principles of: (i) gender responsive sustainable development, (ii) democracy, (iii) respect for human rights, (iv) good traditional and family values, (v) positive attitude towards work, (vi) peaceful coexistence and, (vii) private-public partnerships.To achieve middle-income status, Zambia’s socio-economic development objectives are: (i) to attain and sustain annual real economic growth rates of between 6 and 10 percent, (i) to attain and maintain a moderate inflation rate of 5 percent, (iii) to decelerate the annual population growth rate from its 2005 rate of 2.9 percent to a rate of less than 1.0 percent over the next 25 years, (iv) to reduce national poverty head count to less than 20 percent of the population and, (v) to reduce income inequalities measured by a Gini coefficient of less than 40, (vi) to provide secure access to safe potable water sources and improved sanitation facilities to 100 percent of the population in both urban and rural areas.In order to eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, the government plans a well nourished and health population by 2030. Strategies to be implemented are: (i) develop or advocate policies and programmes that will ensure food and nutrition security, food quality and safety at individual household, community and national level, (ii) prevent and control specific macro and micronutrient deficiencies and promote appropriate diets and lifestyles throughout all stages of human life, (iii) strengthen nutrition care practices for vulnerable groups, including young children, adolescents, women in the reproductive age, and HIV/AIDS infected, and those affected by non communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart diseases, and cancer, (iv) develop and sustain human resource capacity in the nutrition sector to meet the growing nutrition demands, and (v) establish and maintain an efficient institutional arrangement and strong nutritional networks, (vi) attainment of 80 percent access to clean water supply to all by 2015 and 100 percent by 2030.In order to make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable, the sector vision is an efficient, competitive, sustainable and export-led agriculture sector that assures food security and increased income by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government plans to: (i) increase agricultural productivity and land under cultivation by 2030, (ii) increase exports of agricultural and agro-processed products by 2030, (iii) preserve the agricultural resource base by 2030, (iv) increase land under cultivation to 900,000 hectares by 2030, (v) increasing land under irrigation to 400,000 hectares by 2030; (vi) increase agricultural machinery, tractors per 100 hectares to 2 by 2030, (vii) increase livestock population to 6,000,000 by 2030, (viii) increase fish population to 300,000mt by 2030, (vii) land being productively exploited for socio-economic development by 2030, and women men and the disabled have equal access to productive land for socio-economic development by 2030.Regarding the reduction of rural poverty, the government plans to sustain full employment by 2030. Strategies to be implemented are: (i) to maintain unemployment rate to below 10 per cent of the total labour force by 2030, (ii) the proportion of the labour force operating in an environment in which labour laws are respected and safeguarded to reach 90 per cent by 2030, (iii) to have an efficient and effective labor market information system in place by 2015, and (iv) to ensure that the minimum wage is commensurate with the prevailing living wage, (v) innovative and productive lifelong education and training for all by 2030. In addition, the government plans to include Gender equity and equality in the socio-economic development process by 2030 through, among others, the following strategies: (i) economically empower women through acquisition and ownership of titled land, (ii) reduce and ultimately eliminate gender imbalances and inadequacies associated with the provision of education, training and development, (iii) facilitate and provide economic support to institutions that offer credit facilities to women for land development.

"LEX-FAOC149440";"National Land Policy.";"The National Land Policy was adopted by Jamaica in 1997 as a national policy for the land sector. It establishes the framework needed for Jamaica to become more progressive, transparent and modern in its approaches to land and geographic information management systems, land administration and utilization, land resources and environmental management, and land development planning. The goals and objectives of this Policy are to ensure the sustainable, productive and equitable development, use and management of the country’s natural resources. The policy seeks to enhance the sector with interventions related to land information management systems; land resources and use; land titling, land tenure and access; acquisition, pricing and divestment of government owned-lands; taxation and incentives for property development; environmental and disaster management; legislation; and institutional framework and reform.In particular, the Policy identifies and seeks to ensure the establishment of an effective network and land information management system, the basis for all planning, development, utilization and management and administration of land; affordable and legally secure access to land for the majority; property taxation measures that would allow for the provision of necessary services; incentives for property development; recognition of the disasters to which the country is prone, and the protection and conservation of sensitive and scarce resources, while pursuing development initiatives in an environmentally sound manner; divestment and acquisition procedures and mechanisms, and pricing formulae that are transparent and rational; innovative and more dynamic approaches to land use planning and development; a participatory approach to planning and development with private sector, non-government and community based initiatives to deal with settlements and environmental issues and to implement solutions; effective land management and administration institutions; and a programme of reform for legislation on land.As mentioned, the Policy adresses land tenure and access issues. Regarding this matter, Chapter 4 of the Policy sets out these policies: a) the Government will continue the programme to putting in place programmes and measures to streamline the land titling process, and modernize land registration activities; b) the Government will deal with the issue of family land to determine how this cultural practice can be recognized and dealt with legally. Solutions to be examined include restricted freehold structure, mandatory land registration, possibility of co-heirs leasing the land and in establishing a legal framework in which this type of tenure can be registered.The Policy will seek to incorporate a disaster mitigation component and hazard risk zoning in physical development plans; and to develop local capacity to prepare landslide, seismic zonation, and storm surge maps.

"LEX-FAOC155203";"National Land Policy of Sierra Leone.";"The Final National Land Policy (NLP) of Sierra Leone provides the vision, principles and policy components to give direction to and definition of the roles and responsibilities of various government and customary authorities, and other non-state actors, in land management. Specifically, it enunciates policy statements in respect of the key components of the National Land Policy such as access to land and tenure, land use, regulation and the management of special land issues, land administration structures, land laws and the Constitution. The document addresses the major issues related to land management and administration in Sierra Leone, with a view to moving towards a clearer, more effective and just land tenure system that shall provide for social and public demands, stimulate responsible investment and form a basis for the nation’s continued development. The text of the policy is composed of the following Chapters: 1) Introduction; 2) Vision and guiding principles; 3) The land question; 4) Issues related to constitutional reform; 5) Land tenure framework; 6) Facilitating equitable access to land; 7) Land rights administration and institutional framework; 8) Land use planning and regulation for land development; 9) Land issues requiring special intervention; 10) Land policy implementation framework.The NLP makes reference to food security issues. As regards access to land for responsible investment, it stipulates that the Government shall create an enabling environment to attract responsible investments (both domestic and foreign) in accordance with established laws and procedures without exceptions. The Government shall adopt measures to ensure that investors act responsibly, respect human and land rights, do no harm to food security, local livelihoods and the environment. Measures shall therefore be taken to guarantee food security and the realization of the right to adequate food.The NLP takes into special account the importance of sustainable use of land and natural resources. Spatial planning will take duly into account the need to promote diversified sustainable management of land, and land-based natural resources, including agro-ecological approaches and sustainable intensification. Chapter 8.3 outlines environmental management principles.The document also aims at reducing rural poverty. It is established that land use planning should also accommodate the goals of food security and the progressive realization of the right to adequate food, poverty eradication and sustainable livelihoods.The NLP aims at enabling more inclusive agricultural systems as regards land tenure and gender issues. One of the guiding principles is to ensure equal rights of women and men in the enjoyment of all human rights, acknowledge differences between women and men and shall take specific measures to accelerate de facto equality where discrimination exists. Further, the NLP shall ensure equal tenure rights and access to land for women and girls independent of their civil or marital status. Chapter 9.2 regards land rights for the vulnerable groups and minorities. The Government shall facilitate and promote indigenous knowledge and build the capacity of customary tenure institutions to enhance land governance in all areas consistent with the principles and aspiration expressed by the National Land Policy.The policy aims at increasing the resilience of livelihoods to disasters. Chapter 9.5 regards disaster management. The Government shall: a) rationalize the legal, policy and institutional frameworks for the prevention and management of land-related disasters; b) strengthen the legal and administrative frameworks for resettlement in the event of natural disasters; c) regulatory frameworks for tenure, including spatial planning, should be designed to avoid or minimize the potential impacts of natural disasters; d) address legitimate tenure rights in disaster prevention and preparedness programmes; e) legitimate tenure rights of displaced persons should also be recognized, respected and protected. Information on tenure rights and unauthorized use should be disseminated to all affected persons; f) during the reconstruction phase. Persons who are temporarily displaced should be assisted in voluntarily, safely and with dignity returning to their place of origin. Systems for recording legitimate tenure rights should be resilient to natural disasters, including off-site storage of records, to allow right holders to prove their rights and relocate their parcels and other spatial units.The Ministry of Lands shall, in consultation with other sectorial agencies and development partners, set out a framework for the implementation of this National Land Policy. The envisaged framework shall provide for the establishment of an interim administrative mechanism to operationalize this Policy pending the establishment of the NLC. In addition, the framework shall provide for capacity building and mechanisms for financing the implementation of this Policy. The Ministry of Lands shall establish a National Land Policy and Reform Unit (NLPRU).

The Plan will seek to plan and invest resources in a coordinated way, addressing the three dimensions of food security through an integrated approach; to increase convergence of domestic and external sources of funding in support of agriculture, food security and nutrition; to mobilize additional resources from the national budget and from external partners, and to monitor commitments, pledges, expenses and remaining gaps; and to monitor and evaluate investments in food security and prescribe remedial measures to activities that requires strengtheningThe Plan is comprehensive in that it addresses the three dimensions of food security — availability, access and nutrition — in an integrated way. The Plan seeks to cover investment in Infrastructure (including facilities, equipment and materials), information (including studies, generation and propagation of information through research and advisory services), institutions (including strengthening physical and human capacities of institutions, streamlining operational modalities, training, staff motivation and awareness) and innovations. The Plan aims at linking food availability, food access and food utilization, in particular by shaping food availability proposals - mostly related to agriculture - so that they enhance access and improve nutrition of the most food insecure and malnourished.The Plan will seek sustainable and diversified agriculture through integrated research and extension; improved water resource management and infrastructure for irrigation purposes; improved quality of inputs and soil fertility; fisheries and aquaculture development; livestock development, with a focus on poultry and dairy production; and strengthened capacities for implementation and monitoring of this Strategy.The Plan will seek to reduce rural poverty through the development of value chains that contribute to increased rural incomes and employment opportunitiesPublic goods financed by the Plan will aim to directly increase production of, access to and balanced utilization of nutritious food; enable increased investment by smallholder producers; and encourage / leverage private investment through the promotion of Public-Private Partnerships. The Plan will seek improved access to market, value addition in agriculture and non-farm incomes; enhanced public food management system; food safety and quality improvement; institutional development and capacity development for more effective safety nets; community based nutrition programmes and services; and orient food and nutrition actions through data.The Plan will build the capacities of the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management and Directorate of Food to better manage the food system through capacity building interventions to handle public food distribution systems. This includes staff training in all spheres of public food management and effective responses to emergencies and improving supervisory and monitoring activities through logistics support. In addition, the plan will increase and modernize public storage and handling facilities, including in disaster prone areas. The Plan will seek to build modern storage facilities that are better equipped to adapt to the climate change impacts and resist disaster shocks; repair and rehabilitate existing warehouses; and improve ambient environment of stocks to maintain quality and increase shelf life. These interventions are aimed towards speeding up strategic response capacity, reducing cost and storage loss, maintaining food quality and safety and adapting to the climatic impacts.The Food Planning and Monitoring Committee, a cabinet-level committee representing the ministers and secretaries of the ministries concerned with food security, will be responsible for providing political guidance and orientation. In addition, a national committee, a food policy and working group and thematic teams will support the implementation of the Plan.

Su objetivo general consiste en institucionalizar y operacionalizar un proceso que permita el fortalecimiento y la ampliación de oportunidades económicas, sociales, políticas y culturales en igualdad de condiciones a las mujeres rurales, a fin de reducir al año 2015 la brecha de género existente en el agro hondureño. Los principios rectores de la política son: 1) igualdad de las personas en el área rural; 2) sostenibilidad en el uso de los recursos naturales; 3) promoción de las personas de modo que participen en el proceso de desarrollo; 4) eficiencia y eficacia en el desarrollo de acciones en busca de la equidad de género y el desarrollo productivo del sector agrícola. La política está dirigida a la población agrícola rural y no sólo a sectores o grupos de mujeres beneficiarias; es decir, tiene como principal beneficiaria a la población agrícola femenina en su conjunto, pero abarca a todos los productores del área rural.Entre los objetivos específicos de la política se contempla mejorar, con carácter de urgencia, el estado de la seguridad alimentaría de las familias campesinas, incorporándole enfoque de género. Entre las acciones se prevé potenciar el papel de las mujeres en la producción de alimentos, especialmente de los subsistemas huerto y patio, tanto en lo referido a alimentos vegetales, como animales.El documento busca que la agricultura sea más productiva y al mismo tiempo sostenible. En este sentido contempla medidas para integrar a las mujeres y hombres, en igualdad de condiciones, como elemento clave para alcanzar la sostenibilidad ecológica, para lograr la reducción de la pobreza y el mejoramiento de la calidad de vida.La política propicia sistemas agrícolas inclusivos a través de una serie de medidas en el ámbito del acceso y control de los recursos productivos básicos. Se definen los siguientes objetivos específicos : 1) promover el acceso a propiedad en el uso y tenencia de la tierra de las mujeres rurales, dando prioridad a las mujeres jefas de familia; 2) facilitar el acceso de las mujeres rurales al crédito; 3) promover a las mujeres rurales como beneficiarias de la capacitación técnica (tanto de producción como de mercado) y la transferencia de tecnología, dando prioridad a los que son jefas de familia. Asimismo se prevén medidas para alcanzar el acceso de las mujeres a la capacitación laboral y a las inversiones productivas destinadas a este sector que se ha priorizado como motor de la apertura comercial en la agroindustria rural. Otra cuestión que la política aborda expresamente es el de las desigualdades y desventajosas condiciones de trabajo de la fuerza laboral femenina en el sector rural.Con respecto a la institucionalidad, uno de los ejes de la política es lograr la institucionalización de la equidad de género en todas las entidades del sector público agrícola. La política será implementada a través de planes operativos anuales de cada una de las instituciones del sector público ágrícola, en los cuales se programarán las metas, actividades, cronogramas y responsables de cada medida. El seguimiento regular de la ejecución del plan será competencia del Comité Técnico Interinstitucional del Sector Público Agrícola.

Chapter 2 (articles 19 to 21) defines rights and liabilities of land users. Land assignment procedures are outlined in Chapter 3 (arts. 22 to 31). Article 23 concerns assignment of land for agricultural purposes. Chapters 4 to 7 contain provisions relative to payment of rent and fees, termination of tenure relationships, reimbursement of land users and indemnification of agricultural losses, and the settlement of land disputes. Chapters 8 and 9 concern the protection of land by providing rules for (the supervision of) the rational use of land. Chapter 10 provides for the State land cadastre and other land management instruments to control and monitor land use. Chapter 11 is entirely dedicated to farming lands, being all lands used for agriculture. Farming lands are assigned in accordance with article 65, and as far as ""dehkans"" (private farms) are concerned articles 66 to 69. Chapters 12 to 17 concern the use of land for other purposes, including use for protected areas (14), forest reserves (15), water resources conservation (16), and for the ""national reserve"" being land held in reserve (17). The last two Chapters deal with infringement of land legislation and the application of international agreements. (105 articles)

"LEX-FAOC151052";"Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative - National Strategic Action Plan.";"The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative - National Strategic Action Plan is a national sectoral action plan of Nigeria. It applies to the period of 2012-2017. Its main goal is improving the well-being of the affected people and reducing their vulnerability to climate change through improved use of land and other natural resources for sustainable development and support to climate resilient infrastructure.The Action Plan, among others, treats the issue of food security. In this area, it provides for improvement of the management of land resources and their sustainable use. More specifically, the relevant programmes and activities will focus on identifying proven sustainable land management practices in the sub-region and up-scaling best practices that will contribute to sustainable ecosystem-based integrated land management in areas under threat of land degradation, for greater ecosystem stability, enhanced food security and improved rural livelihoods.The Action Plan also promotes improvement of critical infrastructure for enhanced and sustainable socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. In particular, it notes that investment in core physical infrastructure broadly comprising roads, transport systems, communications, energy and water supply, housing, environmental conservation structures, including parks and forestry can, among others, contribute significantly to sustainable development and management of natural resources in dryland areas of Nigeria, which contain vast resources, biodiversity and watersheds with potential for agriculture, fishing and energy generation.One of the objectives of the abovementioned goal of the Action Plan is to achieve sustainable management of natural resources and to make agriculture, in its broadest sense, the main lever for rural development, economic and social growth. Specifically, this will entail among others restoring the production capacity of existing forest plantations and establishment of additional ones, and development of good governance models of locally based sustainable forest management and promoting efficient management of water and land resources for the optimization of the benefits, mitigation of floods, and reduction of conflicts.Further, one of the policy pillars of the document focuses on the development of basic socio-economic infrastructures in the affected areas. For this, public sector investment in rural roads, health care facilities and educational institutions will be pursued in partnership with the private sector. Other project activities will focus on improving access to drinkable water, markets, recreational facilities, and electricity and communication services. Moreover, another policy pillar of the document encourages private sector operators to invest in the huge economic potentials of natural resources of the region to generate green jobs, ensure environmental sustainability and derive economic benefits through public-private partnership. Emphasis will be in the area of innovative mechanisms for private sector financing of sustainable land management, and biomass- based resources for renewable energy sources and environmental protection, including for example provision of land, and tax holiday.Lastly, one of the key objectives of the document is to fight desertification. To this end it provides for enabling policy, legal and institutional framework for sustainable land management and desertification control. Specifically, it promotes sustainable financing for desertification control focusing on issues of developing a strategic resource mobilization approach and putting in place a Desertification Control Fund that would be facilitated and used by all stakeholders, including the private sector, in the country to address key desertification and land degradation challenges, as well as exploring the opportunities for development while combating desertification. Moreover, the document also provides for Integrated Water Resources Management. This programme among others envisages sustainable water resources management for flood mitigation, groundwater improvement, pollution control and conflict reduction as well as water harvesting for afforestation and agricultural development. Finally, the Action Plan also targets at establishing early warning mechanisms. Specifically, it will promote creation of a center for drought prediction and early warning that forms part of regional and global networks and will establish Ecological and Environmental Observatory Centres that will compliment those in Niger Republic for the monitoring of land degradation or improvement.The action projects of the Action Plan are expected to be implemented through government organizations in active participation with the local communities. Consequently, the Federal, State and Local Governments of Nigeria, and their decentralized offices, are the principal partners in the implementation.

El plan tiene alcance nacional y adopta una perspectiva de mediano plazo, relativo al período 2007-2017. La cuestión de la igualdad de género es abordada desde el enfoque de los derechos humanos. El documento está organizado en torno a siete grandes temas nacionales prioritarios a través de los cuales deberán abordarse los principales problemas que enfrentan las mujeres en la sociedad dominicana. Los temas son los siguientes: 1) promover una cultura de igualdad y equidad de género; 2) garantizar todos los derechos de las mujeres y el pleno ejercicio de su ciudadanía; 3) fortalecer el empoderamiento económico e impulsar la superación de la pobreza de las mujeres; 4) promover el liderazgo, la participación y representación política y social de las mujeres en favor de la igualdad de género; 5) favorecer el acceso y control de las mujeres a bienes y servicios de calidad; 6) erradicar cualquier forma de violencia contra las mujeres en todo su ciclo de vida; 7) promover la plena participación de las mujeres en la sociedad de la información y el conocimiento.En el marco del tema nacional nº 3 (fortalecer el empoderamiento económico e impulsar la superación de la pobreza de las mujeres) se contempla como objetivo específico eliminar el hambre, a través de programas de alimentación beneficiando a mujeres pobres o jefas de hogar.El plan brinda especial atención a la situación de la mujer rural y, en el contexto del empoderamiento de la mujer, se prevén mecanismos de asignación de propiedad rural a las mujeres.Con el objeto de propiciar sistemas agrícolas y alimentarios inclusivos que respeten el rol de la mujer, se contemplan líneas de acción orientadas a desarrollar programas de capacitación laboral para mujeres que buscan primer empleo en zonas rurales. Otro objetivo en este sentido es la integración de las mujeres en el manejo y conservación de los recursos naturales y protección del medio ambiente. Se plantea que las iniciativas de políticas públicas se basen en estudios sobre el impacto de estas variables en la vida de las mujeres y que éstas participen activamente en todos los procesos decisorios relacionados con los recursos naturales y el medio ambiente. En el marco del tema nacional nº 3 se prevé superar la brecha de género en la propiedad de la tierra.A nivel de gobernanza, el PLANEG II contempla mecanismos institucionales de coordinación y articulación para la implementación del plan (apartado II.1.3). Asimismo se fortalece el rol normativo del Ministerio de la Mujer. Este enfoque va de la mano con la necesidad de que el Ministerio de la Mujer ponga en marcha un sistema de seguimiento y evaluación de la ejecución del PLANEG II, en coordinación con los organismos responsables de su coejecución.

These provide the need for equality between men and women and boys and girls in all spheres of socio-economic development. As such, gender will be mainstreamed in the implementation of the PSTA II programs.The overall objectives of the gender strategy is to contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development through institutionalisation of gender responsive programming (planning and budgeting), implementation, monitoring and reporting systems and improve gender equality in agriculture sector.The gender strategy will enable the MINAGRI and its partners effectively respond to the practical needs and strategic gender interests of both men and women farmers.The strategic objectives are: (i) to institutionalise gender equality in the agriculture sector, (ii) to develop capacities in the agriculture sector to enable gender sensitive programming, (iii) to enhance the gender responsiveness in delivery of agricultural services, (iv) to promote equal participation in decision making processes.In order to make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable, the government plans to enhance the gender responsiveness in delivery of agricultural services will focus on a number of activities to promote gender equality, including: land use consolidation, agricultural mechanisation, fertilisers and seeds, one cow per poor family.Regarding the reduction of the rural poverty, the government plans to implement the following strategies: (i) train rural women and men in soft skills that include leadership, interpersonal communication, conflict resolution, (ii) development and establishment of mechanisms for inclusion of gender related issues in SWAP, (iii) to develop and coordinate partnerships and collaborative mechanisms amongst government institutions, CSOs, private sector and development partners and integrate appropriate actions to respond to practical and strategic gender needs in the agriculture sector, (iv) supporting farmers, especially women, in project formulation and other soft skills (entrepreneurship, leadership, teamwork, conflict management), (v) communication and awareness on existing facilities (RIF2, agriculture and women guarantee fund) so that both women and men farmers and entrepreneurs have enough knowledge on how to access the funds, (vi) develop operational guidelines and procedures to facilitate equal access by women and men to opportunities and services that are channeled through farmer organisations and cooperatives, including women representation (at least 30%) in those structures and their active participation in decision making processes.In the context of governance, the implementation will be facilitated by a gender steering committee (GSC) primarily comprising of not more than 8 members, one from each of the following ministries MINAGRI, MIGEPROF, MINALOC, MINECOFIN, DC partner promoter, Gender Monitoring Office and the Gender Specialist employed by MINAGRI. It is envisaged that the role of the GSC will be to provide overall strategic direction in implementing the plan and advice on gender mainstreaming issues. The committee will also be responsible for, publicity and marketing the strategy. MINAGRI with the coordination of the Gender Specialist will collaborate with relevant government institutions and agencies such as stated above as well as the private sector, development partners and NGOs for the implementation of the strategy.

In doing so, the Act provides the principal legislative components of a new, integrated, system for nature conservation within Scotland. The Act also locates the conservation of biodiversity and of Scotland's natural environment within a wider British, European and global context. In relation to biodiversity in particular, it requires public bodies and office-holders to consider the effect of their actions at a local, regional, national and international level.The Act is divided in 5 parts and contributes to the new system for nature conservation by means of a combination of both new measures and amendments to existing legislation. In Part 1 it introduces a new general duty on all public bodies and office holders to further the conservation of biodiversity. In the exercise of their functions, they must have regard, among other things, to the Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992. Part 2 makes changes to the existing arrangements for the establishment and protection of sites of special scientific interest. In doing so, it replaces most of Part II of the existing Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (c.69). The Act extends in Part 3 the law in relation to the protection of birds, animals and plants by making significant amendments to the current provisions of Part I of the 1981 Act and by requiring production of a new code of guidance covering whale and dolphin watching and similar activities. Part 4 requires the creation by Scottish Natural Heritage of a code of guidance setting out recommendations, advice and information relating to fossils. Part 5 provides for various supplemental matters including the publication of statutory guidance about the duty to further the conservation of biodiversity and Scottish Natural Heritage's functions under Part 2 and for minor and consequential amendments and repeals to a variety of other Statutes.

The overall goal of the Strategy is to achieve integrated national development that is environmentally sustainable. The instrument seeks to develop a coherent framework with an appropriate set of strategies that will foster productive and optimal utilization of land, freshwater, coastal and marine resources in an environmental sustainable manner. To achieve this, the Strategy will develop a legislative policy framework for land and marine management, establish network administrator organizations, develop tools for management of land and marine resources, and develop a framework for planning, implementation, monitoring and review.The overall objective is to develop and widely utilize tools for the creation of a seamless integrated system for management of land and marine resources. The aim is to implement activities and programmes related to natural resource assessment, information management, education and public awareness, standards of codes of practices, economic instruments and incentives, environmental impact assessment, and land use planning. In particular, the Strategy will seek to ensure that individuals and economic entities are given appropriate incentives for sustainable resource use and environmental protection. It will develop economic incentives for private land owners and users to invest in soil and water conservation methods, agro-forestry techniques, good husbandry practices, development and maintenance of tree plantations or woodlots, use of appropriate livestock stocking rates; and provide tax incentives to businesses undertaking restoration and conservation.The Strategy also seeks to create efficient network administrator organizations for coordination of land and marine resource management in the country, thus contributing to making agriculture and resource management more inclusive and efficient.Special consideration is given to future natural hazard and climate change impacts; and the conduction of environmental and natural hazard impact assessments for all land use plans. In addition, training in environmental intelligence, information management, trend impact analysis and forecasting including predicting climate change future scenarios will be conducted.A main outcome of the Strategy is to create coordinating mechanisms needed to implement the Strategy and to ensure that action can be taken at all appropriate levels of decision making. The Strategy is to be implemented with support from all stakeholders, including ministries, agencies, statutory bodies, private sector, non governmental entities, communities and individuals.

"LEX-FAOC158315";"Strategic Plan for Environment and Development.";"This document lays down the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development (SPED), which was adopted by Malta following the introduction of Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning. The SPED provides the spatial framework that supports the development of an integrated maritime policy at a national level. The plan covers the marine waters up to the 25 nautical mile limit of the Fisheries Management Conservation Zone, and it does not include the administration and implementation of the provisions of the Continental Shelf Act. The SPED defines a spatial vision for the urban area, the rural area, the coastal zone and marine area and for Gozo. Four key thematic issues emerge from the document: (1) socio-economic development; (2) environment; (3) climate change; (4) travel patterns. The general objective for the national spatial framework is to ensure the sustainable use of land and sea resources. The Government will adopt the following sequential approach to the use of land: (a) firstly, the reuse of existing developed land and buildings; (b) secondly, redevelopment of existing developed land and buildings; (c) finally, where no other feasible alternatives exist, use of vacant land. Land take up in the rural area should be the last resort.The SPED aims at making agriculture (among other activities) more productive and sustainable. The first thematic objective relating to socio-economic development is to manage the available potential space and environmental resources on land (and sea) sustainably to ensure that socio-economic development needs are met whilst protecting the environment and limiting land take up within rural areas.Reduction of rural poverty is envisaged in relation to the vision defined for rural area.

"LEX-FAOC004824";"Land Law.";"This Act lays down basic provisions on land tenure, both rural and urban. All land in Viet Nam is the property of the State, but individual and corporate users, both domestic and foreign, can obtain from the State usufructuary rights under lease-type contractual arrangements (art. 1). Long-term leases, in particular, of cropland are made for twenty years for annual crops and aquaculture, and for fifty years for perennial crops, both terms being renewable on expiry (art. 20). However, the duration of leases granted to foreign investors shall be consistent with the terms made in regard to foreign investments by the Act on Foreign Investment (art. 83). A ceiling of three hectares nation-wide restricts the allowable size of leaseholds for the cultivation of annual crops, while restrictions to the size of other leaseholds are to be determined by the Government (art. 44). A rental price is, in principle, payable against all leases (art. 79(4)); however, the lease of agricultural land, forest land, land used for aquaculture and land used for salt production is exempted from payment of a rental price (art. 22). Lease rights can be traded, sub-leased, inherited and mortgaged, subject only to the term of duration of the original lease, and to conformity of the land use to the stipulations made in the original lease and to the prescriptions of land use regulations and plans in effect (arts. 3(2) and 74-78)). In particular, the sub-leasing of land under cropping and aquaculture is expressly permitted, for a period of up to three years, renewable in ""special cases"" (art. 78).The transfer of leasehold rights is subject to payment of a tax (arts. 4 and 79(4)). To this end, and, in general, for the purpose of calculating the rental price of land to be leased, the Government is directed to evaluate land from time to time, at their entire discretion (art. 12). Land under lease can be taken back by the State in specific circumstances (arts. 26 and 27), including, in particular, non-use of the land for twelve consecutive months without permission to do so (art. 26(3)), and against payment of compensation (arts. 28 and 73(6)). Protection from unlawful encroachment by third parties and from Government is a fundamental right of all legitimate lease-holders (art. 73(6)). Such protection is available through litigation in the courts of law or before the local Government administration, depending on the nature of the matter in dispute (arts. 38 and 39). Finally, provision is made in the Act for the issuing of title in the form of Land Tenure Certificates (art. 36), cadastral mapping country-wide (art. 15), and land use planning (arts. 16-18).

The capacity building will be done regarding climate forecasting and analysis of its socio-economic impact.The Vision sets forth a cross-sectoral approach in reducing rural poverty. The living standards of the rural population will be improved through increasing agricultural production and mobilizing small farmers. Small scale farmers will be mobilized through making available key inputs such as special credit, certified seed training, small farm equipment, veterinary coverage for livestock. A special fund will be established for financing operations by local communities through village organizations and farmers’ schools. Employment and income generation will be ensured and opportunities will be provided through diversification of the rural economy towards agro-based industries such as livestock, fisheries and poultry. Initiatives will be launched to improve the skills and technology for reducing poverty and empowering women. Technical and financial assistance will be given to fishing communities. Community organizations and associations will be developed.The Vision also aims at enabling more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems. The competitiveness of the agricultural systems will be strengthened by adopting Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Standards will be set for agricultural commodities from Pakistan to create more opportunities of export. Private sector-led growth will be ensured by promoting investments in value added products for domestic and export markets such as floriculture. The market systems for perishable commodities will be improved. Investment in transport and preservation technologies will be promoted. Measures for developing the rural infrastructure are envisaged too. The structural transformation of agriculture from small scale to commercialized agriculture will be ensured and the non-farm sector including agro-processing will be enhanced. Market development including input, output and rural financial markets will be intensified. The asset ownership of small farmers will be enhanced by improving access to land, water and livestock. The institutional and legal changes will be done regarding the ownership, supply and use of water. Public investment will be done in rural infrastructure and institutions including water management, research, extension and education. Importance will be given to the issue of land division through inheritance. Special attention will be given to reduce the loss of fertile land to urbanization. Animal health coverage will be improved. Measures will be taken and control will be ensured regarding invasive pathogens imported with food, feed, seeds, livestock and germplasm. Post-harvest losses and bad hygienic conditions in fisheries sector will be addressed to improve the marketability of fish products.

Member States must take all necessary measures to ensure the safe collection and disposal of waste oils. In particular, they shall ensure that the disposal of waste oils is carried out by recycling (art. 3). The following are to be prohibited by Member States: (1) any discharge of waste oils into internal surface waters, ground water, coastal waters and drainage systems; (2) any deposit or discharge of waste oils harmful to the soil and any uncontrolled discharge of residues resulting from the processing of waste oils; (3) any processing of waste oils causing air pollution which exceeds the level prescribed by existing provisions. Article 6 prescribes that any undertaking which disposes of waste oils must obtain a permit. Such undertakings must be inspected periodically by the competent authorities designated by Member States. Moreover, article 10 provides that any establishment producing, collecting or disposing of more than a given quantity of waste oils per year, to be specified by each Member State but not higher than 500 litres, must keep a record of the quantity, quality, origin and location of such oils and of their despatch and receipt as well as convey such information to the competent authorities on request.

The aim of this Directive is to prevent or reduce negative effects on the environment, particularly emissions into air, soil, surface water, as well as the resulting risks to human health which might arise from incineration and coincineration of waste. Within this framework, the requirements set forth in Directive 75/442/EEC are to be met.This Directive covers incineration and coincineration plants. However, the plants described by article 2 (2) shall not fall within its scope. No incineration or coincineration plant shall operate without the permit referred to in article 4. Article 5 concerns the precautions to be taken by operators as regards the delivery and reception of waste, particularly hazardous waste. Further operation conditions are laid down in article 6. Waste water from the cleaning of exhaust gases discharged form an incineration or coincineration plant shall be subject to a permit as prescribed by article 8. Residues resulting from the operations hereby envisaged are to be minimized in their amount and harmfulness. Residues shall be recycled directly in the plant or outside in compliance with relevant Community legislation (art. 9). Article 10 deals with control and monitoring. Article 12 regulates access to information and public participation. Six Annexes are attached. Annex II is devoted to the determination of air emission limit values for the coincineration of waste. Annex III describes measurement techniques. Annex IV sets forth emission limit values for discharges of waste water from the cleaning of exhaust gases. Annex V establishes emission limit values. Lastly, Annex VI indicates formula to calculate the emission concentration at the standard percentage oxygen concentration.

"LEX-FAOC152231";"Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper- A National Programme for Food Security, Job Creation and Good Governance.";"The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - A National Programme for Food Security, Job Creation and Good Governance (PRSP) is a cross-sectoral national strategy paper of Sierra Leone. It is in force for the period of 2005-2007. Its main objective is to address the poverty challenges and attain food security and create employment opportunities.Achieving food security is at the heart of Sierra Leone’s poverty reduction strategy in the next three years. The government’s overall objective in the period is to reduce hunger and malnutrition and accelerate the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Attaining food security will contribute significantly to the attainment of other important poverty reduction goals, especially the reduction of child malnutrition and mortality and improvement in maternal health on a sustainable basis. According to the PRSP, addressing food security requires coordinated short and medium term strategies and measures in the key sectors that influence the various dimensions of the country’s food problems. Interventions will include addressing availability and sustainability of food supply and accessibility at the household and national levels in the short to medium term. Some of these strategies have been adequately elaborated in the Government’s Food Security Strategy elaborated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. The short and medium term strategies will be combined with other sectoral interventions, including incentives and facilities to attract private sector investment in agricultural production, to ensure sustainability in increased food production, create rural jobs and income for growth in agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors.A Right to Food Secretariat (RFS) has already been set up by the Government and its partners to support the coordination of activities in the food security sector. The work of this Secretariat will be strengthened to maximise the synergy among the productive, infrastructure and social sector activities that will accelerate the achievement of food security within the medium term.In the fisheries sub-sector, government’s short and medium objective is to increase supply of fish to the domestic market and for export. The strategy is to support fishermen and women engaged in both the artisanal and aquaculture sub-sectors with essential inputs and skills training in processing. In the marine sub-sector, the thrust is to maximise fish landing for export and the domestic market. A major investment proposal is the construction of a modern fishing harbour in Freetown to support this strategy.In the agricultural sector, the short term objectives of government intervention are diversification of the crop mix in the uplands, and intensification of production from the small hectares cultivated in the lowlands. This will be achieved through the introduction of new technology, input provision through credible farmers’ associations at the local level, and targeted extension support, especially to the unemployed youth and the small-scale farmers. More vulnerable farmers will also be targeted with food-for-work. This will contribute to an increase in food production to tackle hunger at household level in the rural areas in the short term. The Government will also continue to encourage private sector investment in agriculture, especially for the production of food for the market, in the short term. Provision of inputs and appropriate farm machinery on a cost recovery basis or favourable credit terms as appropriate and extension support will be central to this strategy. Also, government will work through local authorities to facilitate access by private sector operators to land for commercial cultivation and markets and storage facilities.In the medium term, support to small-scale farmers will aim at increasing their capacity to produce enough to meet their own input needs directly or through established input and output markets. Emphasis will also be placed on increasing the stability and reliability of food supplies through a comprehensive feeder (farm-to-market) roads programme and the provision of market, storage and drying floor infrastructure in all chiefdoms in the country. Operations research and development, land development and use, and extensive training of extension staff and farmers will also be pursued.A large number of institutions will be involved in the implementation of the programmes in the PRSP at all levels – national, district, chiefdom and ward – to reflect the diversity of interests expressed in the participatory phase of the process. The coordination and implementation arrangements will be structured in a flexible manner to accommodate the diverse entities in Government, civil society, local communities and the private sector. The institutional framework supporting the M&amp;E system will involve many agencies both within the public sector (line ministries, commissions, local councils, etc.) and without (NGOs, CBOs, CSOs) to reflect the broad interest generated in the PRSP, the participatory approach used in its preparation and the transparency in governance espoused by government. The M&amp;E framework will involve greater coordination of efforts of all the institutions.

"LEX-FAOC163002";"Philippine Development Program. Integrated Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework.";"The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) is a six-year national government development platform with a multi-sectoral approach. It aims at contributing towards achieving an inclusive, value-chain oriented, and climate resilient agriculture and fisheries sector. It provides an operational Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan (AFMP) for an integrated technical support service delivery at the local and national levels, build strategic network of rural logistics infrastructure within priority value chains in targeted program areas, strengthen and develop viable rural enterprises through efficient supply and value chain of key agricultural and fishery products in targeted program areas, implement and model innovations towards more effective and efficient institutional support systems for programme implementation, and institutionalize stakeholder engagement. The thrust of PRDP to develop a market-oriented and climate-resilient agriculture and fishery sector will be articulated through its four (4) components: i) Local and National Level Planning (I-PLAN), ii) Infrastructure Development (I-BUILD), iii) Enterprise Development (I-REAP) and, iv) Project Implementation Support (I-SUPPORT).The document aims at making agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable.The programme also enables more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems. The document recognizes that economically, indigenous cultural communities are at a great disadvantage. Traditionally farmers, hunters and fishers have very limited or no access to information and knowledge on sustainable agricultural practices, inputs and technologies, as well as improved plant stock and seeds. Therefore it provides for training, empowerment and develops farmers’ skills in making critical and informed decisions towards a more productive, profitable and sustainable crop production system. Measures on land acquisition are foreseen as well.The Provincial Program Management and Implementation Unit (PPMIU) shall provide direct supervision and monitoring of the implementation of and compliance with this Framework. As part of this responsibility the PPMIU shall submit monthly, quarterly and annual reports.

"LEX-FAOC006866";"Act LV of 1994 on Arable Land.";"The purpose of this Law is the establishment of market oriented conditions in the agricultural sector based on private ownership. Land transfer and the use of land as guarantee for land-based credit should promote the efficient operation of new businesses. This Law basically regulates the use of arable land and aims to create landed properties suitable for competitive agricultural production, avoiding to burden land with the effects of excessive subdivision. The reduction of agricultural land should remain within reasonable limits and the conservation of land quality should have legal backing. In Chapter I introductory provisions regarding the effect of the Law and definition of terms are set forth. The Law applies to all arable land in the national territory, to the utilization and conservation of land, to the acquisition of landed property and its restrictions and to the creation of plots. The provisions apply to urban land, whether under agricultural or forestry cultivation. Chapter II deals with the acquisition of ownership of arable land by Hungarian and foreign private persons or legal entities. EU citizens enjoy the same rights as Hungarians if they have been living and operating in the field of agriculture for at least 3 years in Hungary, and if they meet certain requisites and undertake some obligations. The Law covers acquisition under any form except: legal inheritance, adverse possession, construction over others' property, expropriation and through auction for compensation purposes. Use of arable lands is provided for in Chapter III. Use rights are regulated in the Civil Code as is the lease of arable land, unless this Law provides otherwise. Chapter IV deals with procedures for the creation of estates (general land reform, voluntary exchange of lands). Provisions on the utilization and protection of arable land are set forth in Chapter V. Cultivation profiles should be respected. Changes in cultivation profiles are to be authorized, otherwise penalties are foreseen. In the light of these purposes, soil conservation has an important role and aims to maintain the productivity and quality of the soil. Soil conservation is provided for in Chapter VI which sets forth State duties, the obligations of land users and provides for soil conservation authorities and their duties. Soil conservation penalties shall be applied to offenders.

"LEX-FAOC149178";"Programme d’Action National d’Adaptation aux changements climatiques (PANA)";"L’élaboration du Programme d’Action National d’Adaptation aux changements climatiques (PANA) est le fruit d’un processus participatif qui s’est appuyé sur des études de base, des enquêtes de terrain, des consultations et de nombreuses réunions de travail et ateliers. Ce Programme d’Action découle d’une analyse préalable du climat et vise à identifier les besoins immédiats et urgents d’adaptation aux changements climatiques, en indiquant les activités prioritaires.L’objectif du PANA est de contribuer à réduire les effets néfastes des changements climatiques sur les moyens de subsistance des populations et les zones les plus vulnérables et d’accroître ainsi leur capacité de résistance aux modifications et à la variabilité climatiques.Le PANA est articulé autour des quatre grands axes suivants: (i) une vue générale du contexte géographique, environnemental et socio-économique des Comores, (ii) une analyse de la variabilité du climat et des changements climatiques observés et projetés, l’influence des changements climatiques et de la variabilité du climat sur les processus biophysiques et les secteurs clefs, ainsi qu’une identification des groupes et des zones particulièrement vulnérables, (iii) l’objectif du PANA, la stratégie de mise en œuvre y compris ses liens avec les programmes de développement et les Accords Multilatéraux sur l’Environnement, (iv) un recensement des options d’adaptation face aux changements climatiques, les conditions pour une intégration systématique de l’adaptation dans la planification pour le développement, la méthodologie utilisée pour le classement et la priorisation des options d’adaptation.Pour remédier à l’insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle et combattre la pénurie alimentaire, le PANA envisage de redoubler l’effort pour améliorer l’accès à l’eau potable par la préservation de la qualité et le traitement pour l’amélioration de la santé des populations. De plus, un autre projet est prévu également dans le cadre du PANA qui vise la création d’une banque de semences et variété plus adaptées à la sécheresse, la formation et la spécialisation des promoteurs, la réduction des pertes de rendements l’accroissement de la production vivrière et un meilleur accès des groupes vulnérables à la nourriture. Enfin, une introduction de Dispositifs des Concentration de Poissons (DCP) sera mise en place par le PANA. L’exacerbation des conditions climatiques, notamment la fréquence des tempêtes et des cyclones rendra la mer inaccessible par les pêcheurs, ce qui se traduira par une baisse de leurs revenus. Les dispositifs de concentration de poissons sont une option d’adaptation qui permettra d’augmenter les prises afin de valoriser au mieux l’investissement en temps de travail et en intrants de pêche. Les DCP permettront également de constituer des réserves alimentaires pendant les périodes de mauvaises conditions atmosphériques.Dans le cadre de la réduction de la pauvreté, le PANA envisage de mettre en place un projet qui vise à restaurer les sols dégradés, défendre les sols contre l’érosion pour augmenter la surface agricole utile et réduire la pression foncière et limiter la pénétration de l’agriculture sur les forêts. Le projet permettra de réduire la pression foncière, et l’accès des pauvres à la terre pour limiter la pénétration de l’agriculture dans la forêt par l’augmentation de la surface agricole utile.S'agissant de l’amélioration de la résilience des moyens de subsistance face aux menaces et crises ayant des répercussions sur l’agriculture, la nutrition et la sécurité alimentaire, un système d’alerte précoce est envisagé aussi dans le cadre du PANA pour permettre de mettre en place un système de surveillance et d’alerte sur les situations à risques climatiques sur l’ensemble du territoire national.Dans le cadre de la gouvernance, la mise en œuvre du PANA sera placée sous la responsabilité directe d’un comité de pilotage qui sera créé au niveau de chaque île sous la tutelle du Ministère de l’Environnement de l’île. Ce comité comprendra un représentant: des groupes vulnérables, du comité insulaire PANA, du comité d’orientation du DSRP de chaque île, des institutions en charge du développement de l’île, du mouvement associatif, de la société civil, du secteur privé, des experts ayant effectué les évaluations participatives de la vulnérabilité.

"LEX-FAOC149176";"Plan Stratégique de Relance du Secteur Agricole (PSRSA).";"Vu l’importance du secteur agricole dans la lutte contre la pauvreté, le Gouvernement Béninois a mis en place un Plan Stratégique de Relance du Secteur Agricole (PSRSA) pour la période 2010-2015. Fondé sur le diagnostic général du secteur, ce plan propose des orientations stratégiques et les principales actions à mener pour stimuler une croissance économique durable dans le secteur agricole et rural et les conditions de leur mise en œuvre.La stratégie présente une vision de faire du Bénin, une puissance agricole dynamique à l’horizon 2015, compétitive, attractive, respectueuse de l’environnement, créatrice de richesse répondant aux besoins de développement économique et social de la population. L’objectif global est d’améliorer les performances de l’agriculture béninoise, pour la rendre capable d’assurer de façon durable la souveraineté alimentaire et nutritionnelle et de contribuer au développement économique et social du Bénin, à l’atteinte des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement et à la réduction de la pauvreté.Cet objectif global est décliné en deux objectifs spécifiques, à savoir: (i) contribuer à la croissance et à la sécurité alimentaire à travers une production efficace et une gestion durable des exploitations, et (ii) assurer la compétitivité et l’accès des productions et produits aux marchés grâce à la promotion des filières agricoles.Les stratégies sur lesquelles se fonde le PSRSA sont au nombre de neuf à savoir: (i) renforcement de la disponibilité et de l’accessibilité aux semences de qualité; (ii) renforcement de l’accessibilité aux intrants; (iii) mécanisation des activités agricoles adaptée et accessible; (iv) mise en place de financements adaptés et accessibles; (v) amélioration de l’accès aux connaissances professionnelles et aux innovations technologiques; (vi) développement et opérationnalisation des aménagements agricoles; (vii) sécurisation et gestion de l’accès au foncier; (viii) facilitation de l’accès aux marchés; (ix) professionnalisation des exploitations de type familial et, promotion des grandes exploitations et de l’entrepreneuriat agricole.Dans le cadre d’une agriculture plus productive et plus durable, le PSRSA envisage des actions et mécanismes à mettre en œuvre pour garantir la disponibilité et l’accessibilité des semences végétales, animales et halieutiques pour permettre l’amélioration de la productivité agricole au Bénin. De plus, le PSRSA envisage l’amélioration de la disponibilité et de l’accessibilité des intrants qui passera par les orientations stratégiques suivantes: (i) l’amélioration de l’accès des producteurs aux intrants, notamment ceux des zones enclavées se fera par le biais de la mise en place de réseaux de distribution de proximité, à la charge du secteur privé; (ii) la promotion d’engrais spécifiques et autres intrants organiques biologiques pour une gestion durable de la fertilité des sols; (iii) le financement des campagnes agricoles pour permettre aux exploitants d’avoir les disponibilités voulues pour l’adoption des intrants améliorés.Dans le cadre de la lutte contre pauvreté rurale, le PSRSA envisage une professionnalisation des exploitations agricoles de type familial et la promotion des grandes exploitations comme une mesure de la croissance et la réduction de la pauvreté.Au niveau des systèmes agricoles et alimentaires plus inclusifs et efficaces, les actions à ce niveau seront menées dans le cadre du Conseil National du Transport Rural. Elles porteront sur: (i) la définition des axes et le choix des priorités, de concert avec les Communes, sur les travaux à effectuer en matière de construction ou de réhabilitation des pistes de desserte rurale et agricoles et autres voies d’accès des populations aux aménagements et aux infrastructures socio économiques; (ii) la réalisation de pistes et ouvrages agricoles pour le désenclavement des vallées et autres bassins de production afin de faciliter l’évacuation des produits agricoles vers les marchés; (iii) la mise en place des modalités d’exécution contribuant à la réduction des coûts de transport; (iv) la recherche et la mise en œuvre des conditions de pérennisation.Dans le cadre de la gouvernance, le cadre institutionnel de mise en œuvre du PSRSA constitue un cadre privilégié où tous les acteurs privés et publics pourront jouer efficacement leur rôle. Le fonctionnement du cadre institutionnel repose sur un Conseil National d’Orientation et de Suivi (CNOS) qui est l’organe d’orientation et de régulation de la politique nationale du développement du secteur agricole soutenu au niveau déconcentré par des Conseils Départementaux d’Orientation et de Suivi (CDOS) et des Conseils Communaux d’Orientation et de Suivi (CCOS).

"LEX-FAOC150857";"Forestry Sector Policy.";"The Forestry Sector Policy is a national sectoral policy which sets forth long-term, medium-term and short term objectives relating to the sustainable use of forest resources. The long-term objectives of the Policy are: a) to meet the people’s basic needs for forestry products on a sustainable basis; b) to contribute to food production; c) to protect land from degradation; d) to conserve and use biological diversity and genetic resources in a sustainable manner; e) to create opportunities for income generation and employment. The medium-term objectives of the Policy are: a) to promote public participation in land and forestry development, management and conservation; b) to improve the organizational framework and institutions. The short-term objectives of the Policy are the following: a) to provide increased opportunities to people for forestry resource management; b) to manage natural forests in order to contribute to socio-economic development; c) to strengthen institutions and legislation.Regarding land-use planning, existing land-use categories will be improved so that productivity is increased and the forestry sector will be developed. Land and forestry resources will be managed and utilized according to their ecological status on a sustainable basis. The production of forest products in natural forests, farm and commercial plantations will be promoted. Land-use planning will be ensured also as an integral part of ecosystem management. The production of fuelwood, timber, fodder and non-wood products will be increased. Livestock management on the amount of fodder production and highland pasture will be the base to improve forest management and to increase the production of fodder by community efforts. An integrated national forge development program will immediately be designed to improve pasture and livestock management. Emphasis will be given to improve breeds in order to increase productivity and control livestock populations to reduce demands for feed. Reforestation will be done in depleted forest areas to fill production gaps.The policy aims at contributing to the eradication of poverty in rural areas. To this end, it sets out measures concerning assistance and advisory services to households for the management and utilization of the forests. The principles of decentralization will be applied in the forestry sector through community forestry. Priority will be given to underprivileged communities. The poor will be employed in forest based industry. Fair incomes will be paid to rural poor who collect raw materials.The policy further aims at enabling more inclusive and efficient forestry systems. Emphasis will be given to integrated farming for strengthening soil conservation and watershed management for research and extension. The involvement of the private sector and non-governmental organizations will be enhanced. Private forestry will be promoted by encouraging plantations on farms and other private land. Commercial plantations will be promoted especially in the Terai. Research on multipurpose trees, bamboo, shrubs, medicinal and aromatic plants will be conducted in order to identify improved stocks for planting. The involvement of the private sector in the controlled harvesting and distribution of wood and other forest products will be promoted. The efficiency of pricing policy of forestry products will be improved and an internal market system will be promoted. Research on farming systems will be coordinated for a better pasture and livestock management. Communities will be encouraged to grow commercial forest crops and to establish forest based processing enterprises outside of the community forest. For the promotion of private involvement in forestry sector development: a) the land tax on private land used for the plantation of forest species will be reduced, b) the land-holding ceiling for the private land will be extended, c) financial support to private nurseries and plantations at low interest rates will be provided, d) import regulations on essential commodities will be made easier. Forest industry will be improved by a) making low cost financing available, b) liberalizing the import of raw materials, c) supporting technical and vocational training, d) promoting the commercialization of non-timber forest products. Public participation will be enhanced through effective conservation education and extension activities. Community forestry will be promoted by entrusting forest protection and management to user’s groups and by supporting and empowering these user’s groups. Education on nature conservation and forestry will be promoted. All accessible hill forests will gradually be handed over to local communities. Participation of women in users' communities is encouraged.The Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation (MFSC) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the policy. Policy coordination among sectors is the responsibility of the Government and especially of the National Planning Commission. An Environment Division with a strong Biodiversity Section, a National Biodiversity Steering Committee and Forestry Sector Coordination Committee has been established within the MFSC. In addition, a ministry for implementing environmental programs which safeguard the lives and property of people will be established. New legislation will be developed and existing legislation will be amended for better conservation of land and forests.

"LEX-FAOC163564";"The Uganda Gender Policy (2007).";"The Government of Uganda's first National Gender Policy (NGP) was approved in 1997. The policy provided a legitimate point of reference for addressing gender inequalities at all levels of government and by all stakeholders. The major achievements of this policy include among others, increased awareness on gender as a development concern among policy makers and implementers at all levels; influencing national, sectoral and local government programmes to address gender issues; strengthened partnerships for the advancement of gender equality and women's empowerment and increased impetus in gender activism.Gender issues cut across all development sectors and levels. Therefore assessment of progress, outcomes and impact of interventions to address gender inequality is a shared responsibility for all development actors and agents. However, MGLSD shall be responsible for coordinating M&amp;E of the UGP within the overall government monitoring systems and frameworks. The ministry will act as a catalyst to other sectors on gender responsive monitoring. Process and output indicators shall be periodically designed and reviewed within the Action Plan for the implementation of this policy. 5.3 The specific strategies shall include: (a) Developing and implementing interventions that respond to diverse livelihood needs of women and men; (b) Developing and promoting labour and time saving technologies for the poor women and men; (c) Developing incentive frameworks to improve the earning potential of poor women and men for improved productivity and output; (d) Promoting social protection interventions for poor and vulnerable women and men; and. (e) Developing strategies to eradicate the child labour incidence with emphasis on the exploitation of the girl child.6.0 Implementing the Uganda Gender Policy will be multi sectoral. It is premised in the acknowledgement that the pursuit of gender equality and women's empowerment is a responsibility for all sectors in the development arena. All actors in the public and private sectors have a role to play in the implementation of this policy. Institutions are expected to identify entry points and opportunities for networking and collaboration to ensure synergy and maximum impact in addressing gender inequality. The cross cutting nature of gender implies that the different actors/sectors have the responsibility to finance the gender mainstreaming interventions pertinent to their respective sector. 3.2 The purpose is to establish a clear framework for identification, implementation and coordination of interventions designed to achieve gender equality and women's empowerment in Uganda. The policy is a guide to all stakeholders in planning, resource allocation, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of programmes with a gender perspective. 3.3 Objectives: 1) To reduce gender inequalities so that all women and men, girls and boys, are able to move out of poverty and to achieve improved and sustainable livelihoods; 2) To increase knowledge and understanding of human rights among women and men so that they can identify violations, demand, access, seek redress and enjoy their rights; 3) To strengthen women's presence and capacities in decision making for their meaningful participation in administrative and political processes; 4) To address gender inequalities and ensure inclusion of gender analysis in macro-economic policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.5.0 The priority interventions and action areas are arranged into four thematic areas; livelihoods, rights, governance and macro-economic management. The interventions and proposed strategies are derived from the situation analysis section. Responsibility for undertaking these interventions shall lie with central government ministries, departments and agencies, local governments, civil society organisations and the private sector.5.3 Good governance entails respect for the rule of law, democratization, participation in decision-making, transparency and accountability, and protection of human rights. Gender equity is critical for good governance as it ensures the effective participation of women and men in the democratization process, leadership, decision-making and law enforcement.

"LEX-FAOC151071";"National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP).";"The National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) is a sectoral national plan of Nigeria for the period of 2011-2014. Its main objective is enhancing total factor productivity in the agricultural sector through the application and diffusion of knowledge and improvement in the technology base.One of the components of the Plan is agricultural productivity enhancement. The main goal of this component is to boost output of food commodities through strategic interventions in the production, processing, storage and marketing of staple and cash crops, fishery and livestock products as well as to foster the development of smallholder agriculture and income generation in the rural areas, improve national food security and reduce poverty. The specific objectives include: (1) increasing incomes of rural farm households through increases in agricultural productivity, diversification and sustainable use of natural resources; (2) enhancement of food security of consumers through improved availability of food and access to a variety of foods and increase income of producers attained through efficient marketing; (3) enhancement of farmers’ and consumers’ access to support services such as extension, credit, nutrition and health education; and (4) fostering the participation of the poorer section of the rural population in the development of the community. The targeting mechanism is in favour of vulnerable groups as well as actual food insecure people. The primary concern is the poor small scale producers and entrepreneurs, particularly women, youth and the physically challenged. Clearly defined eligibility criteria are in place to forestall elite capture.Another component of the Plan aims at strengthening land and water management as well as providing land management services and additional water sources for all-year-round agriculture. It is targeted at extending the area under sustainable land management and reliable water control systems. NAIP will undertake a national soil testing exercise aimed at determining the nutrient status of soils so as to provide a guide for appropriate fertilizer use that are crop specific and environmentally friendly. The projects proposed for financing under the NAIP seek to ensure that all existing dams and irrigation facilities are exploited and managed through Public-Private-Partnership arrangement. The River Basin Development Authorities are to be restructured and managed in a more efficient manner with a view to making them centres for improved seed for crops, livestock and fishery multiplication, for the construction and maintenance (not management) of dams and primary channels, promotion of a strong extension system for the States of coverage, and more importantly, for the farms in their irrigated lands. The projects will support the provision of processing facilities for the major crops and livestock of the farm system of the Authorities; provision of potable water supply, roads and basic infrastructure for rural communities to facilitate access and product evacuation as well as to improve the environment to attract young farmers to the rural areas.Furthermore, the NAIP supports commercial agriculture. The main goal of this component is to provide the interventions required to support private entrepreneurs in varied commercial ventures in agricultural production, processing and marketing. The objective is to strengthen agricultural production systems and facilitate access to market for targeted value chains among small and medium scale commercial farmers in the five participating states. The NAIP resources will finance critical subcomponents which will boost the outputs in commercial crops, fisheries and livestock production, processing and marketing. Additionally, NAIP focuses on the critical linkages and support services needed to enhance productivity and outputs as well as increased income of farmers in Nigeria with the ultimate goal of attaining food and nutrition security and wealth creation. The principal objective of this component is to improve the access of farmers to inputs, raise product quality and provide effective linkages to market outlets. It also focuses on linking farmers to input dealers and product markets. It will also be used to enhance capacity building of farmers and core extension workers and agro-dealers. NAIP resources will be expended on such activities as fishery terminal, fertilizer quality control, seed certification, capacity building of farmers and extension agents; interstate pest control post, among others.The Federal Government of Nigeria will be responsible for the effective management and delivery of results of the projects under the NAIP. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is the national agency responsible for programme implementation. At the state level, the responsibility for field execution squarely lies with the states, in collaboration with the Local Government Councils. The communities will also play active role in programme planning and implementation. With appropriate support from site managers, consultants and NGOs, they will prepare and annually review their development programmes.

La Ley establece un Registro de Explotaciones Agrarias de Regadío que deberá identificar y recoger todos los datos referentes a dichas explotaciones. El capítulo III establece cuatro clases de tierras de regadío debiéndose fijar mediante Decreto los criterios técnicos que permitirán atribuir una tierra determinada a la clase correspondiente. La Ley otorga especial atención a las explotaciones comunitarias (cap. IV), a las que se podrán extender los derechos y deberes establecidos, si así lo solicitaren, para las explotaciones familiares agrarias, y a las explotaciones familiares agrarias (cap. V), entendiéndose por tales, todas aquellas que tengan como base territorial parcelas procedentes de transformaciones en regadío efectuadas por iniciativa del Estado o la Comunidad Autónoma y cuyos propietarios fueran personas físicas en el momento en que se les adjudicó la propiedad, se les reconoció el derecho a adquirirla o a mantenerla en régimen de reserva.La Ley establece la creación de un Fondo de Tierras que tendrá diversas funciones, incluida la compraventa de tierras entre particulares, la proposición del ejercicio de los derechos de tanteo y retracto. El Fondo de Tierras está administrado por la Consejería de Agricultura y Comercio. Por último, el capítulo VII se refiere al otorgamiento de ayudas a los agricultores, quienes deberán ser titulares de explotaciones que agreguen en propiedad a la suya, tierras de regadío, siempre que la explotación resultante no supere el tamaño de la explotación de rentabilidad familiar mínima más el 10 porciento de esa superficie. Si se tratara de un tamaño superior sólo beneficiará de la ayuda la superficie necesaria hasta alcanzar la contemplada en el artículo 8º de la Ley.

"LEX-FAOC006508";"Law No. VII of 1961 on forest and wildlife management and its implementing Decree No. 73 of 1981 of the Cabinet on the management of forests and wildlife.";"This is a comprehensive statute of forest management aiming to extend forests by reforestation, to produce good quality and competitive forest products; to contribute to soil conservation, water management and other useful purposes; to integrate hunting and wildlife management with the national economy. The Law differentiates between forests (for timber extraction, research purposes, protection forests and recreational forests, protected forests and for wildlife management purposes) and other woodlands whose surface area is less than half a hectare. The latter are destined for protection or agro-forestry purposes. Detailed provisions regarding forest redistribution, subdivision, administration and use are contained in section III. State-owned forests may be administered by State forestry organizations, by ministries or national authorities (provided this is done for specific purposes) or by municipal bodies if the forest does not serve prevalently felling purposes. Agricultural and fishing production cooperatives, specialized agricultural cooperatives and their associations, as proprietors or users, may carry out their activities in forests. Forest owners' associations are established by this Law as proprietors of their forests and as legal persons. Forest management shall be performed within the framework of State forestry structures. The creation of contiguous woodlands suitable for large-scale forestry is encouraged. New administrators (users) may be nominated directly. To avoid one proprietor having several small pieces of woodland in different areas, voluntary exchange between owners os provided for. If direct nomination or voluntary exchange is not possible, forest redistribution between administrators (users) or owners should be organized. Redistribution procedures are elaborated by municipal commissions and carried out by county land offices and the process is directed and supervised by the Minister. Changes occurring during redistribution should be registered in the land register. Protection forests and protected forests may not be exploited by production cooperatives. Forest owners' associations are supervised directly by county level special administrative organs. Members are entitled to proportional shares in profits. By-laws of such associations shall conform with requisites of the Ministry. Changes in crops cultivated and in users, as well as the subdivision of forests require authorization. Activities which can be performed by administrators (users) are listed in article 10 of the Law. Basic principles of forestry are set forth in section IV. These are: species suitable for the habitat of the area in question should be planted; clear-felling is allowed only in flat and slightly hilly land so as to avoid soil erosion; protection forests are those forests having special purposes such as soil conservation, water management, health care, military purposes etc. General rules of forestry and special provisions regarding protection forests are provided in this section. A ten-year forestry plan should be prepared by each forestry organization by an expert and authorized by the Minister. Annual plans are also to be prepared by administrators (users). Provisions relating to State forestry management and forest works are set forth in section V. State forestry authorities manage the forests of forest owners' associations within the framework of State forestry organization. The number of professional staff to be employed is determined on the basis of the size of the forest. Detailed rules of afforestation and tree planting are provided for in Section VI, with special regard to afforestation and tree planting for public interest. Section VII lays down provisions for the safeguard and protection of forests and other smaller woodlands. Safeguarding is the duty of the administrator (user) and he has to mark out clearly the boundaries. There are special provisions regarding forestry officers and forest guards, damages caused to woodlands, interference with proper use of forests, traffic on forest roads, protection against forest fires and sylvo-pastoralism (prohibited in protection forests). Section VIII deals with the transport of forest products and processing of timber. Sawing and panel industry are regulated in details in special provisions of law. Section IX, in particular, provides for wildlife management and hunting. The State has exclusive hunting rights over the entire national territory. Hunting rights can be given in concession or surrendered to individual hunters' associations or to the national federation of hunters' associations. These organs which are entitled to hunt can not convey hunting rights to others but can stipulate hunting contracts. They are obliged to safeguard hunting grounds and game stock. Damages caused by wild animals and indemnities are regulated in this section as well. Forestry management is regulated in Section X. The Ministry keeps a register of forests and other woodlands. Technical development is provided for in section XI. It includes yield increase and utilization of advanced working methods and procedures. Dissolution of forest owners' association is regulated in Section XII.

"LEX-FAOC015009";"Loi nº 014/96/ADP portant réorganisation agraire et foncière au Burkina Faso.";"Cette loi détermine les principes fondamentaux de l'aménagement du territoire, de la gestion des terres rurales et urbaines, du régime de l'eau, des forêts, de la faune, de la pêche, des substances de carrière et des mines, ainsi que la réglementation des droits réels immobiliers. Elle est formée par 248 articles répartis en 7 titres, à savoir: Champ d'application (I); Création et définition du domaine foncier national (II); Aménagement du territoire (III); Gestion du domaine foncier national (IV); Réglementation des droits réels immobiliers (V); terres du domaines foncier national situées à l'étranger (VI); Dispositions finales (VII). Le domaine foncier national est constitué de toutes les terres et des biens immeubles ou assimilés cités à l'article 34 de la loi. L'aménagement du territoire doit tenir compte des contraintes et de potentialités du milieu naturel, des capacités humaines et techniques, des nécessités économiques et sociales, des interactions et des spécificités socio-économiques régionales et de la protection de l'environnement. L'aménagement distingue les zones urbaines et celles rurales et se fait sur la base de quatre types de schéma: national, régional, provincial et schéma directeur d'aménagement, chacun de ces schéma étant élaboré par une spécifique commission. Tout changement de destination de terrain doit être approuvé par un décret pris en conseil des ministres. Tout aménagement doit être précédé par une étude d'impact sur l'environnement. L'article 34 arrête la liste des biens immeubles du domaine foncier national qui, en raison de leur nature, de leur destination et de leur affectation , bénéficient de mesures particulières de gestion et de protection. Ces biens sont inaliénables, imprescriptibles et insaisissables et grèvent les fonds riverains de servitudes d'utilité publique. Les articles de 38 à 40 fixent les critères pour la délimitation et la gestion des terres urbaines et rurales, qui sont gérées par les structures suivantes: la commission d'attribution des terres destinées à l'habitation, la commission d'évaluation et de constat de mise en valeur des terres, la commission de retrait des terres. Dans les villages, l'attribution, l'évaluation et le retrait des terres relèvent de la compétence de commissions villageoises de gestion des terroirs organisées en sous-commissions spécialisées. Les articles de 48 à 61 réglementent les titres de jouissance des terres, toujours nécessaires à l'exception des cas d'occupation et d'exploitation des terres rurales non aménagées dans le but de subvenir aux besoins de logement et de nourriture de l'occupant et de sa famille. La délivrance des titres est subordonnée à la mise en valeur des terres et au paiement des droits et des taxes dus. Les terres urbaines destinées à l'habitation sont attribuées de gré en gré, et dans certaines zones bien définies, par adjudication. Les articles de 66 à 70 réglementent l'aliénation des terres du domaine foncier national, normalement subordonnée à l'obtention préalable d'un permis et à des conditions particulières de mises en valeurs. Les articles de 71 à 147 portent principes de base pour la gestion de l'eau, des forêts, de la faune, des pêches et des substances de carrière et des mines, et les relatives infractions et sanctions. Le titre V porte les dispositions relatives à la définition des droits réels immobiliers, aux principes de la publicité foncière, à la vente sur saisie immobilière, à la procédure d'adjudication et de ses incidents et à la distribution du prix entre les créanciers du propriétaire exproprié; à la responsabilité en matière de publicité foncière; au fonds d'assurance en matière de publicité foncière pour la réparation des dommages causés aux tiers, aux transactions et mutations de droits réels immobiliers et de leur cession forcée. Les titres fonciers précédemment supprimés sont rétablis. La loi renvoie à un décret pris en conseil des ministres pour la réglementation des structures, conditions et instruments de gestion des terres des collectivités territoriales, à prendre dans un délai d'un an.

Part 1 imposes certain duties on local authorities in relation to access on and over land in their areas and, in particular, requires them to draw up and adopt a plan of core paths in their areas. Part 2 confers on bodies representing rural communities a right to buy land with which the community has a connection. The right will arise in relation to land in which the body has registered an interest, when that land comes to be marketed or sold. Part 2 defines the land which can be bought under that Part, sets out the procedures for establishing a community body, for registering an interest in land. Part 2 also sets out the circumstances in which the right to buy is activated and the procedures for exercising it (including procedures for valuation of the land being bought, for appeals and for compensation). Part 3 gives bodies representing crofting communities a right to buy certain land. It therefore defines the land that can be bought, who can buy it and how it is to be acquired.

"LEX-FAOC152356";"National Livestock Policy.";"The National Livestock Policy is a sectoral national policy of the Republic of Somaliland. It applies to the period 2006–2016. Its main objective is to provide guidelines, coordination and regulation of the livestock sector in order to increase its efficiency in terms of production and productivity to improve the livelihoods of livestock producers and of the Somaliland economy, through focused use of resources.For attaining this main goal, the Government of Somaliland will improve and maintain the indigenous stock, maximise their production capacity in meat, milk, hides and skins. To this end, the following measures are envisaged: (1) establishment of a functional animal production department within the Ministry of Livestock; (2) provision of legal and appropriate policy frameworks to support technical services delivery and breeding programs; (3) promotion of indigenous knowledge in breeding practice; (4) promotion of research on appropriate and applicable technologies in the pastoral production diversity; (5) engagement and retention of competent human resource for the various disciplines of livestock production; and (6) lobbying and allocation of funds for research in animal production.In addition, the Government will develop national standards and will adopt an enabling environment for the implementation of the national animal Health regulations and is committed to comply with the Guidelines and recommendations of the regional and international certification institutions. For this, the document provides for the following strategies: (1) establishment and maintenance of an early warning system to help prevent the spread of diseases from other countries; (2) dissemination of animal health information to trading partners and regional organizations; and (3) harnessing of resources (locally and internationally) for transformation of animal health and production departments to conform to international standards.The Policy further aims to establish a functional emergency preparedness system within the Ministry of Livestock which has the capability to successfully deal with animal diseases emergencies. The strategies that will be used for this are: (1) contingency planning and allocation of ready to use resources; (2) establishment of coordinated institutional framework to ensure participation of all stakeholders during emergencies; (3) development of a plan of action and mobilization of resources for implementation; (4) enforcement of laws to ensure containment of disease out breaks; (5) establishment of early warning systems, awareness raising and extension services; and (6) establishment of a Disease notification system and confirmation at national and international levels.The document also covers cross-cutting issues for a livestock-related policy, such as land and gender. For the former, it notes that the Policy of the Government is to ensure proper land ownership with better management and utilization for sustainable livestock production and productivity. The following measures are contemplated for this goal: (1) consultative and participatory mechanism to ensure land use and security of land tenure for livestock farmers in the rangeland areas; (2) community based management of natural resources among pastoralists; and (3) participatory and sustainable pastoral and agro-pastoral associations that recognise traditional customary land rights.With regard to gender-related issues, these measures will be promoted: (1) capacity building on gender mainstreaming in livestock pastoral communities; (2) labour saving technologies appropriate to livestock communities; and (3) women and youth empowerment in accessing resources for income generation and market information.Lastly, the document also covers the issue of livestock producers’ cooperatives/organizations and pastoral associations. It indicates that these are emerging grass-root organizations, which are important for development of the livestock industry. These organizations provide several services such as credit, extension, input supplies and marketing channels for livestock production. They will be encouraged to support increased production and productivity, processing, marketing and credit mobilization. The involvement of communities and their organizations is essential for successful implementation of the policy. However, adequate support to farmers’ organizations is crucial in order to ensure adoption of new technologies.The Government will be responsible for the implementation of the National Livestock Policy. The Ministry of Livestock will ensure effective coordination of livestock sector inputs by key players. In addition, the Government recognizes the essential role of the private sector comprising of financial institutions, Chamber of Commerce, livestock farmers, pastoralists, agro–pastoralists, traders, processors and other individuals and organizations that are motivated by profit to undertake investment in the livestock industry.

"LEX-FAOC157214";"Estrategia Nacional de Biodiversidad y Plan de Acción.";"Mediante el presente instrumento estratégico el Estado de Honduras da cumplimiento a uno de los compromisos adquiridos con la ratificación del Convenio sobre Diversidad Biológica, que incluye precisamente el desarrollo de una Estrategia Nacional de Biodiversidad y su respectivo Plan de Acción. El objetivo de esta estrategia es formular una guía práctica y coherente que permita implementar las recomendaciones derivadas del Convenio sobre Diversidad Biológica, además de contar con una herramienta efectiva al momento de determinar las prioridades para encontrar soluciones que produzcan beneficios en la conservación y uso sostenible de la diversidad biológica dentro y fuera de las áreas protegidas y procurar la participación de la sociedad en el contexto de un desarrollo humano y económico. La visión al año 2010 es que Honduras haga una conservación y uso sostenible de los componentes de la diversidad biológica a través de una efectiva coordinación interinstitucional y la participación de los ciudadanos hondureños, para alcanzar una distribución justa y equitativa de los beneficios que de la biodiversidad. La Estrategia está fundamentada en cuatro ejes temáticos, tomados de los lineamientos del Convenio sobre Diversidad Biológica: 1) conservación in situ; 2) conservación ex situ; 3) generación y transferencia de tecnología; 4) distribución equitativa de los beneficios de la conservación.El primer eje (conservación in situ) se refiere a los aspectos de manejo en el sitio, bajo temas de áreas protegidas, organización institucional, reservas naturales privadas, cuencas y otros temas que se refieran a la conservación de la diversidad biológica hecha en los sitios naturales donde se desarrollen. El objetivo es llegar a las características ecológicas y de riqueza genética en los sitios de conservación y reducir al mínimo la incidencia de los factores adversos que tienen impactos negativos sobre la misma, fortaleciendo al mismo tiempo la participación de las comunidades locales en el proceso de protección y conservación de las áreas silvestres. El segundo eje estratégico (conservación ex situ) se refiere a la conservación que se realiza, haciendo uso de infraestructura o estructuras artificiales, bajo los temas de zoológicos, zoocriaderos, jardines botánicos, bancos de germoplasma (semillas), herbarios, centros de documentación y producción de recursos naturales como plantaciones, viveros, camaroneras, granjas piscícolas u otro tipo de recursos utilizables. El objetivo es continuar y promover el uso sustentable de los diferentes elementos de la diversidad biológica mediante el establecimiento de mecanismos de certificación periódica, haciendo uso prioritario de técnicas del conocimiento tradicional. El tercer eje (generación y transferencia de tecnología) tiene por objetivo promover y fortalecer la investigación científica para el conocimiento y conservación de los diferentes componentes de la diversidad biológica, proponiendo el desarrollo de programas integrales para el intercambio de información sobre las bases del ordenamiento territorial y ambiental. También se busca fortalecer el Sistema Nacional de Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental (SINEIA) a nivel central y local. El cuarto eje (distribución equitativa de los beneficios de la conservación) se refiere a temas sobre soberanía, pobreza, acceso a los recursos genéticos, incentivos, biotecnología y bioseguridad.La estrategia busca que la agricultura, la actividad forestal (y otras actividades como el turismo) sean más productivas y sostenibles.Asimismo se propician sistemas agrícolas inclusivos y eficientes. Se brinda especial atención a los conocimientos tradicionales, y a las comunidades indígenas. Cabe por ejemplo destacar, entre las líneas estratégicas contempladas, el fortalecimiento de la legalización de la tenencia de la tierra a comunidades indígenas y locales enmarcadas bajo el Convenio 169 de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo.

The timeframe is a 15 year period from 2014 to 2028, divided into three major phases. The Strategy promotes the creation of economically viable, competitive and sustainable family farms. The overall aim is to contribute to sustainable development and to enhance the agricultural sector in an inclusive and gender and socially equitable manner, so as to ensure food security, alleviation of poverty and the rational use of natural resources. The specific objectives include: a) assisting farmers to improve farm structures by reducing land fragmentation and enlarging farm sizes; b) developing conditions for land consolidation, including a national land consolidation programme and the adoption of a legal framework; and c) implementing successfully the land consolidation projects. The Strategy is aimed at all farmers, with its primary target group being farming families (including all their members, male and female, young and old) who have the potential to drive agriculture production.The Strategy establishes a linkage wbetween land consolidation and rural development policies. Priority is given to equitable development of the quality of life in rural areas. Development of farmer associations will be supported. Land consolidation will give way to small farmers increasing their profitability and ensuring a better livelihood. Land consolidation will also make rural areas and farming become more attractive for the young generation. The development of rural infrastructure will create new jobs and prevent migration. The rural development programems will also focus on environmental conservation and sustainable development. It will be ensured that all members of farming families men, women, old and young will participate in land consolidation projects. The land consolidation projects will respect the property rights of all, including women and youth. A Land Bank will be established to be used in land consolidation activities.Support will be given to improve irrigation infrastructure and strengthening water resource governing bodies, as well as supporting modernization of equipment and distribution of high quality inputs. Investments in agricultural holdings, agro-processing and in the development of agricultural knowledge and skills will be promoted. Farmers will be encouraged to use under-utilized land. Developing rural infrastructure will encourage the development of non-agricultural businesses. The Land Consolidation Strategy will also help to develop and improve the formal land market. The process of implementation of land consolidation will also contribute to commercial family farms and farm activities such as dairies, slaughterhouses, sale of fertilizers. The land consolidation procedure consists of three stages: analysis stage, re-allotment stage and surveying and registration stage. The implementation and outcomes of land consolidation will be monitored and evaluated by three indicators which are land tenure, economic and social indicators.The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection will be the leading authority for land consolidation. The Land Consolidation Section designated by the Ministry shall be the implementing entity for land consolidation projects and procedures. Other entities contributing to land consolidation are Agriculture And Food Directorates, the Immovable Property Registration Office, cadastral offices, local government units, Territorial Adjustment Committees, Land Administration and Protection Directorates, Land Consolidation Commissions and Local Stakeholder Committee.
