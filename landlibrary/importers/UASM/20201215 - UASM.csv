"uasm:5280";"Land consolidation as a factor for successful development of agriculture in Moldova";;"Since 1991, Moldova has carried out a wide range of radical reforms affecting its social and economic system. The land reform, which was practically completed in 2000, created over 1 million landowners among the rural population. Many of them entrusted their land to managers of newly created corporate farms. Others used their privately owned land to establish independent family farms. The creation of independent family farms (so-called ""peasant farms"") was one of the primary goals of the land reform. More than 280,000 peasant farms have been created, averaging 1,86 hectares in size. The small size of the peasant farms, whose holdings are furthermore split into 3-4 parcels, raises considerable concerns about their long-term viability and has led to an intense public debate regarding the impacts of fragmentation. In this paper, we use the data from several recent surveys in Moldova to support the case for land consolidation. We show that, in the individual sector, larger farms produce higher family incomes and thus farm augmentation makes a positive contribution to the well-being of the rural population. We also show that, for farms of a given size, productivity increases as the number of parcels decreases. After demonstrating the economic advantages of consolidation, we proceed to discuss the actual use of various market mechanisms for land consolidation, including leasing as well as buying and selling of land. We then show that, in our surveys, farms with leased land are in fact larger than farms that rely on owned land only. This completes the logical circle of our argument: land consolidation leads to better economic performance, while land leasing is actually used as a market mechanism for consolidation, which benefits both lessees (through increased farm incomes) and lessors (through income from lease payments for their land).";"Lerman, Zvi

The operations on land lease from farms is met less frequently as it causes a range of problems - from issurance of documents and determination of the lease payment to the accounting for expenditure and income. Fair and prompt settlement of these issues is imperative of time and can contribute greatly to extend lease operations and make more efficient the use of land.";"Diaconu, Ana

Ipoteza de bază înaintată este dacă consolidarea terenurilor agricole va avea efecte benefice asupra productivităţii şi dacă această este binevenită pe termen lung. În acest context, se va examina consolidarea în baza principiilor economiei de piaţă, utilizând informaţia obţinută din mai multe studii de teren recent efectuate. În particular, vom arăta că în sectorul individual exploataţiile agricole mai mari consumă mai puţin din producţia obţinută şi dispun de nivele de comercializare mai ridicate. Astfel, acestea obţin venituri din vânzări mai mari, generând un nivel de trai mai ridicat al familiilor din spaţiul rural. De asemenea, gradul fragmentării funciare este corelat cu eficienţa relativă a exploataţiilor agricole, demonstrându-se că unităţile consolidate sunt mai eficiente decât cele parcelate.

The paper aims to discover the determinants for land pricing using the spatial econometrics modeling, as it is widely used when the spatial component is present. The country’s agricultural economy combined with the interest of international organizations and limited data availability directed the focus of this empirical study towards land for agricultural purposes. The factors which determine the land market (for agricultural purposes) in Republic of Moldova are mainly related to economic characteristics of land, such as field productivity, the position on the local landscape (characterized by angle and soil quality), proximity to local or national roads (due to storage and transportation reasons), and economic characteristics of owners. Also, another important role in land market price creation is the pressure of urban space to transform land for agricultural use close to cities and villages in spaces for industrial or residential purposes. This is characterized by the financial pressure from the urban centers which has become significant in land transactions.";"Cimpoieș, Dragoș

As a result it became possible to accumulate the experience necessary for extension of these works in scales of all country. Simultaneously a number of difficulties and problems have been identified. It will be difficult to realize these works without elimination of them. In Moldova in 2008 the Government has accepted the Program of land consolidation that was premature step because pilot projects haven't been still implemented, the Concept hasn't been confirmed and Strategy of land consolidation hasn't been developed. Therefore at the present stage it is necessary to concentrate efforts on developing the land consolidation Concept and Strategy and on improvement of actual legal framework in this field. In the paper the author who participated in implementation of these 6 pilot projects offers some ideas concerning this problem. The factors constraining implementation of land consolidation are considered and some measures on their elimination are recommended. A number of theoretical and practical problems demanding examination and solution in the future are considered. First of all, it is necessary to answer to the question: what we want to realize-land consolidation or land reparcelling. Then in Strategy it is necessary to define: either land consolidation should be completely voluntary or particularly or comprehensive compulsory and how in this case one may apply economic levers to accelerate this process; what are the limits of the state intervention in regulation of land relations in modern conditions; whether it is necessary to limit the sizes of land ownerships, etc. Also it is necessary to establish Land Bank and united state entity responsible for land consolidation, to identify the demand of land consolidation specialists and to organize their training by launching education courses, to develop land market, to amend legal provisions on land consolidation, to determine sources and to develop administrative rules for financing land consolidation projects.";"Horjan, Oleg";;;"Republican Scientific Agricultural Library of the State Agrarian University of Moldova";"2011-12-31";"en";"land consolidation;land reform";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"MDA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://dspace.uasm.md/handle/123456789/4690";"http://dspace.uasm.md/rest/bitstreams/01cd80d0-c832-4309-9d65-dbbeda1daeb4/retrieve";;;;;;"uasm:4690"

In this context, the major factors that determine the farm size are analyzed: placement, inequality of income, average area per 1 inhabitant, and GDP per 1 inhabitant. It has been established that the average farm size is determined basically by the level of development of the countries: the most developed countries have larger farms then developing countries. Also, the topics of land concentration and the duality of farm structure have been investigated. “Medium-sized” family farms, the backbone of any market agriculture, virtually do not exist in Moldova. Moldovan agriculture is characterized by a much greater concentration of land in large farms than agriculture in market economies.

Agriculture in the Republic of Moldova is dominated by several legal forms of organization based on both associative and individual principles. Each of these forms requires a separate study. The paper is focused on the main legal forms of organization and namely: private limited companies (Ltd) and peasant (farmer type) farms. Agriculture is an area in which the legal forms of organization have been most influenced by the process of land reform. The reform has changed the economic essence of the production process in agriculture - the property. International experience in this field has demonstrated the effectiveness and priority of the agricultural farms’ potential based on individual principles, especially those of a family type. The study proves the interaction between property rights and process of agriculture intensification through investments, especially those aimed at the development of vineyard and orchard plantations.";"Zubco, Efim

"uasm:3549";"Comparative analysis of the land fragmentation and its impact on the farm management in some eu countries and Moldova";;"The paper presents selected problems of farm management in terms of fragmented agriculture. The problem of land fragmentation was exemplified by the three countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The main purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of selected indicators of agricultural production in the three selected countries. For the analysis, the data on the concentration indexes was selected: Lorenz concentration coefficient, the Gini index, and territorial concentration coefficient (Gini C and Stuck formula). In selected countries, there is a large number of small and very small farms. They represent the majority of farms managed by private owners. To a large extend, they are called semi-subsistence farms or social farms. Some of them provide a part of their products on the market. Small farms are the part of the so-called European Model of Agriculture – a model that consists of small family farms. It is difficult to indicate correct definition of „small farm”, as it may be defined differently depending on the region or country. In the EU, small farms occupy a dominant position, being a constant subject of debates and policy. The authors of the article stressed the need of strengthening of the small farms position, for example by enlarging their acreage or by initiating horizontal or vertical cooperation, however, shall not impair the role of small farms. They are important in biodiversity protection, preserving the rural landscape, as well as by cultivation local tradition, culture and heritage.";"Kielbasa, Barbara
