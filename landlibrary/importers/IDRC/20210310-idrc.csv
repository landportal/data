"IDRC:10625/55461";"Clamor for justice : sexual violence, armed conflict and violent land dispossession";"";"In this book research focuses on a comparative analysis of the collective strategies employed by indigenous and peasant women to gain access to justice for the sexual violence and other human rights violations they suffered in the context of armed conflict and transition in Colombia and Guatemala. It documents the brutal persistence, over six centuries, of the close links between the forced displacement of indigenous people within their own territories, indigenous peoples’ dispossession of their land, and the rape of indigenous women, analyzing two major episodes of sexual violence against Guatemalan women from the Q’eqchí people, and the women’s struggles to achieve justice.";"Méndez Gutiérrez, Luz

"IDRC:10625/52821";"Local solutions gain ground in East Africa";"";"In Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, a decentralized approach to land administration promises more accessible dispute resolution and a better deal for women. Among the challenges however, are old social attitudes that pre-empt discussion about women’s right to control land. In Lira district, for example, in-laws and land-grabbers routinely chase widows off land. A “viciously vibrant land market” often means that women are swindled in Bugunda district. Local courts are handicapped because they lack an adequate mandate and proper resources to be effective, but they are more accessible than higher-level ones. Awareness is changing and institutional reform coincides with a shift in attitudes.";"Dale, Stephen";"";"International Development Research Centre";"International Development Research Centre";"2011-12-31";"en";"gender equity;land reform;land tenure";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"014;202";"Reports & Research";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/52821";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/52821/1/IDL-52821.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/52821/3/IDL-52821.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"GENDER EQUITY;LAND TENURE;WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION;EAST AFRICA;SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA;LAND REFORM;WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT;LEGAL STATUS";""

A process like Transformative Scenario Planning (TSP) can bring together conflicting opinions and help people to start thinking differently. This report summarises the main steps, processes and ideas involved in the TSP workshops in Botswana. It articulates the process of TSP, how it unfolds in a group setting and how it can be used to draw out questions and concerns. In this case, clarity about the nature of partnerships meant an overt acknowledgment by researchers of the traditionally unequal status of partners.";"Perez, Teresa

The roles of decentralized land administration institutions do not include the protection of women’s land rights. More importantly, District Land Boards only control the allocation of public land and not private or customary. Several land dispute resolution institutions co-exist without clear coordination mechanisms.

Wilmar is a multinational company involved in land grabbing cases related to oil palm plantations in Cross River State, Nigeria. The study shows the extent of Wilmar’s infringement on communal land rights,  examining cases of eviction and destruction of livelihoods. Findings show that the four communities studied suffered from increasing food prices, deficits of local staple foods, evictions and displacement of poor farmers. Severe loss of biodiversity due to pollution and unsustainable environmental practices was observed. Recommendations outline effective community action and advocacy.";"Uyi Ojo, Godwin

Women’s on-farm household and productive labor is significant but underrecognized and under-valued. Women farmers have no rights to farmlands, though most farm production is carried out by them. This paper addresses women’s decision making regarding mango production. Study findings suggest that redressing the gender gap in decision making, and improving management skills of women through training would reduce post harvest losses, impacting farm productivity and increasing income and household food security.";"Sekar, C.

This paper analyses the significance of social networks in SLM among agricultural rural communities in central Ethiopia and eastern Uganda. Social networks facilitate collective action important for small-scale resource-poor farmers, who tend to rely more on informal sources of information, as well as for women farmers, whose information needs are often not addressed by formal extension services.  Findings showed a positive relationship between the strength of social networks and SLM innovation practices. However, private sector networks, particularly important in fostering market-led innovations for enhanced adoption, are conspicuously lacking.";"Tukahirwa, J.M.B.

Linking farmers to better markets for their agricultural commodities would contribute to raising their incomes and motivate farmers’ adoption of conservation in SWC technologies. Areas of relatively high agricultural potential but remote from major markets face disincentives; when farmers are unable to transport produce to markets on time, they are left in the hands of middlemen who dictate low prices. Poor traditional post harvest storage methods add to losses.";"Gidoi, R.

In a context of scarcity of resources, unprecedented land pressure, the persistence of sociocultural constraints and the weak economic power of women, women’s collective access is another strategy, not always successful.";"COULIBALY-TANDIAN, Oumoul Khaïry";"";"";"International Development Research Centre";"2020-01-31";"en";"land administration;land governance;land rights";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"202;SEN";"Institutional & promotional materials";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/58414";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/58414/1/58544.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/58414/3/58544.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"LAND GOVERNANCE;LAND ADMINISTRATION;OWNERSHIP;WOMEN’S RIGHTS;LAND RIGHTS;ACCESS TO RESOURCES;FEMINIZATION OF POVERTY;SENEGAL;SOUTH OF SAHARA";""

Recent examples of large-scale investment models are dependent on the legal landscape in the investor’s country of origin, the investor-community linkages, and the nature of partnership with governments. Positive impact can be minimal, resulting in conflict where implementation fails to influence standards of living and livelihoods, or fails to take into account local institutions, norms and values.

This situation is replicated in almost all informal settlements within the city of Nairobi. Developing affordable shelter for the urban poor, and thereby
realizing the Constitutional right to housing, will require new forms of pro-poor shelter finance

Men have main access to silos and warehouses for grain storage. Other barriers are lack of access to radio and smart phones, lack of farmer organizations for women, and heavy workloads relating to farm work, care giving, and household chores.";"Quaye, Wilhemina

Determination of key factors responsible for use of inorganic fertilizers in the central highlands of Ethiopia is increasingly important as continued land redistribution in already degraded and land-scarce highlands undermines sustainable farming and increases nutrient mining. Education level of the head of the household, number of livestock owned, number of plots owned, land tenure, access to credit and extension, agroecology and manure use influence both the likelihood of adoption and intensity of inorganic fertilizer use.";"Yirga, Chilot

This study tries to examine the contribution of community forestry to household-level income with particular emphasis on group heterogeneity and equity in benefit distribution. The assessment of household level benefits suggests that poorer households are currently benefiting less in absolute terms from community forestry than less poor households. In terms of the contribution of forests to household income, the study results suggest that the poor are not necessarily more dependent than the rich, a finding that contradicts results from other similar studies. Econometric analysis suggests that income from community forests is related to socio-economic attributes and private resource endowments of households. Households with land and livestock assets, as well as upper caste households gain more from the commons, while better educated households depend less on forest resources. Female-headed households benefit less from community forests, further aggravating the inequity in distribution of benefits. The study makes a number of recommendations to improve community forest management in Nepal, which include, due consideration for community needs in selecting species for community forestry, transferability of user rights, which would allow less endowed households to benefit more, and more and equitable representation of women and disadvantaged groups in forest management committees (JEL Q2, Q23).";"Adhikari, Bhim";"";"South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics";"International Development Research Centre";"2003-12-31";"en";"community forestry;property rights";"Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"NPL";"Reports & Research";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/41830";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/41830/1/129471.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/41830/3/129471.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES;PROPERTY RIGHTS;SOCIO-ECONOMIC HETEROGENEITY;FOREST USER GROUPS;EQUITY;DISTRIBUTION OF FOREST INCOME;COMMUNITY FORESTRY;SOCIAL FORESTRY;NEPAL";""

addressed the relationship between internal violence and the agrarian problem in the
Caribbean coast of Colombia, where for several decades armed conflict, internal forced
displacement of rural populations and violent land seizures have been an extremely
strong phenomenon. It also collected multiple memories on the rise and fall of one of
the most emblematic peasant movements of the country, the ANUC, and showed the
impact of conflict on it, as well as the important role of female peasant leadership for
its endurance at the local level. A thorough analysis of the data collected during field
work showed how violent actors and their “front men” combined a whole array of
illegal and legal mechanisms to seize land, often with local institutional involvement
and the connivance of local political bosses. On the other hand, it has documented
how national rural development policies constituted an encouraging setting for the
forced selling of abandoned land by the displaced and impoverished peasant
population. In the region, land has been further concentrated in both the hands of
drug traffickers and war lords, and in those of traditional elites and new agro-industrial
enterprises. Lack of formal land deeds – particularly amongst peasant women –

By 1986 government efforts were launched to control flooding and landslides, building check dams and planting trees. A Community Forestry Program to support local ownership and control of forests was begun. At the same time, new settlements were built in the watershed, large forest areas were cleared, thus creating conditions for a pattern of disasters.";"Poudel, Diwakar

New jurisprudence has begun to emerge, addressing the human rights implications of evictions. Project researchers along with the Katiba Institute and Strathmore University’s School of Law work closely with the community to investigate different existing tenure arrangements in Mukuru to determine how the Constitution and land laws can be used to address challenges related to insecure land tenure. Research findings are intended to target the access to justice, voice, and accountability challenges faced by residents in Mukuru.";"Weru, Jane

"IDRC:10625/14917";"Diagnosis of headwater sediment dynamics in Nepal's middle mountains : implications for land management";"";"An evaluation of headwater erosion and sediment dynamics was carried out to assess the health of the Middle Mountain agricultural system in Nepal. Controversial statements predicting this system's imminent demise and identifying Middle Mountain farming practices as major contributors to downstream sedimentation and flooding have long been promoted and have suggested the following research hypothesis: soil and sediment dynamics and the indigenous management techniques within headwater Middle Mountains basins do not indicate a deterioration in the health of the agricultural system. Three questions were addressed in this research. What are the main controls on normal-regime erosion? How effective is the system of indigenous management at modifying sediment dynamics? What do headwater sediment budgets (erosion, storage, and yield) reveal about the health of the agricultural system? Answers to these questions are suggested and development initiatives proposed. Intensive monitoring was carried out during 1992-1994 within nested basins ranging in size from 72 to 11 141 ha. Variation of storm-period variables in time and space was assessed using five recording rain gauges and a network of up to fifty 24-hour gauges. Surface erosion was measured from five erosion plots on steep bari (rainfed cultivated land). Suspended sediment behaviour was examined through event sampling at seven hydrometric stations. Basin sediment yield was determined for three of these nested basins. Sediment storage was assessed using accumulation pins in khet fields (irrigated cultivated land), khet canals, and bari ditches and through erosion and channel surveys. An annual average of 77 storms were identified over the three-year period with 3.5% of these delivering more than 30 mm total rainfall and a peak 10-minute rainfall intensity of more than 50 mm/h. About 1/3 of all storms regardless of magnitude occurred during the pre-monsoon season. Pre-monsoon and monsoon storms delivered equivalent high-intensity short-term rainfall disputing the hypothesis that it is a higher rainfall intensity in the pre-monsoon season which causes an elevated sediment regime during that season. Total storm rainfall was significantly higher during the monsoon season whereas the period without rain before a storm begins was longer for pre-monsoon storms. The source of suspended sediment was found to vary with season and spatial scale. During the pre-monsoon season, surface erosion from bari was severe when high-intensity rain fell on bare ground. Indigenous farming practices were found to be effective at limiting surface erosion except during the pre-monsoon season when targeted intervention may be useful. During the pre-monsoon season, nutrient loss from headwater basins due to sediment export was at its highest. Severely degraded land remained bare throughout the rainy season, producing sediment at an elevated rate and in relation to total rainfall. The onset of the monsoon season reduced this bari source markedly due to the complete development of a vegetative cover under conventional management. The pre-monsoon-season surface-erosion mechanism of sediment production was replaced with scale-dependent mechanisms resulting from the higher total rainfall of monsoon-season storms. Within the steep terraced hillslopes, the capacity of runoff ditches was more often exceeded resulting in episodic-regime rilling, gullying, and in some instances, terrace failure. When sufficiently heavy and widespread, monsoon storm rainfall led also to stream discharge high enough to damage riparian areas and the system of irrigation dams. The farmers alter the sediment regimes profoundly and their management activities reduce soil loss collectively over all spatial scales. Sediment budgets reveal that a significant component of the sediment produced in the study basin (5.3 km2) was recaptured (35% to 50%) because of these indigenous farming practices. Objective calibration of indigenous knowledge showed it to be well founded but inconsistent. Farmers practise techniques which are well adapted to this environment reflecting their stated receptiveness to innovation and outside support. The detailed measurements show that the important controls on erosion are variable temporally and spatially over scales too small to be considered by conventional monitoring programs in these environments. Spatial differences in rainfall delivery, hysteresis effects, variability in land-surface response, and management activities conspire to yield sediment dynamics which are difficult or impossible to quantify with typical limited monitoring. Site-specific opportunities for investigation should be exploited and a high degree of uncertainty be anticipated. Management recommendations focus on two topics. An improved vegetative cover during the pre-monsoon season is required to reduce soil erosion during that period. Greater retention of these nutrient-rich soils would directly benefit the upland farmer. Rehabilitation of degraded lands and the halting or reversing of further degradation would benefit all farmers by providing a greater land base for biomass production especially in light of an increasing population. Both strategies would benefit hydropower developments by limiting reservoir sedimentation. Above all, proposed changes should enhance - not undermine - indigenous management. Current soil dynamics may be sustainable but it is unlikely that they can remain so in the future under the increased landuse intensification that may be necessary with projected population increases unless support is provided strategically from outside sources. Working with the farmers to develop techniques to improve their ability to recapture previously-eroded soil is a useful area of applied research. The high degree of skill and adaptability of the farmers within this environment suggest that carefully designed intervention which targets vulnerable aspects of the agricultural system while not undermining the present methods have a reasonable likelihood for success.";"Carver, Martin";"";"University of British Columbia";"International Development Research Centre";"1997-12-31";"en";"farmers;land reform;water management";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"NPL";"Reports & Research";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/14917";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/14917/1/106792.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/14917/3/106792.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"SOIL EROSION;LAND REFORM;MOUNTAINS;NEPAL;AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT;INDIGENOUS POPULATION;RAIN;WATER MANAGEMENT;FARMERS";""

The focus is on gender, ethnic and economic differences in access to natural resources in Asia, where two-thirds of the world’s poor live. First, the importance of common pool resources for the poor, women and minority groups is set out along with the implications of reduced or lost access to these resources. Next, the dynamics of state ownership, private ownership, customary management regimes and co-management or community-based management arrangements are reviewed regarding their impact on different lines of inequality. The review then examines how community-based natural resource management regimes can be made more inclusive and equitable through effective participatory processes and interventions that shift bargaining power in favour of marginalized groups. Management regimes based on careful participatory social analysis, and planning processes that are skilfully facilitated, long-term and participatory, can make heard the voices of poor people, minorities and women and include them in community decision-making.";"Reichrath, Silke";"";"International Development Research Centre";"International Development Research Centre";"2006-12-31";"en";"land ownership;land tenure;women";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"142";"Reports & Research";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/34962";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/34962/1/127085.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/34962/3/127085.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"LAND TENURE;LAND OWNERSHIP;COMMUNAL LAND;COMMON POOL RESOURCES;SOCIAL ANALYSIS;GENDER ANALYSIS;RESOURCES MANAGEMENT;COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION;WOMEN;DISADVANTAGED GROUPS;ETHNIC MINORITIES;ASIA";""

Global Witness reported that 2.6 million ha had been given in 272 ELCs, mainly for rubber plantations. Many concessionaires do not comply with their contracts, nor with existing land and forest laws. Government revenues from timber exports are extremely low. Deforestation, and removal of luxury timbers has increased dramatically. Land concessions rob local communities of their income from non-timber forest products. This research aims to raise awareness of government, citizens, and other stakeholders, on macroeconomic impacts of ELCs and wood exports.";"Piseth Sim

"IDRC:10625/57404";"Agronomic challenges and opportunities for smallholder terrace agriculture in developing countries";"";"Improving land productivity is essential to meet increasing food and forage demands in hillside and mountain communities. Tens of millions of smallholder terrace farmers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who earn $1-2 per day do not have access to peer-reviewed knowledge of best agronomic practices, though they have considerable traditional ecological knowledge. Terrace farmers also lack access to affordable farm tools and inputs required to increase crop yields. The objectives of this review are to highlight the agronomic challenges of terrace farming, and offer innovative, low-cost solutions to intensify terrace agriculture while improving local livelihoods. The article focuses on smallholder farmers in developing nations, with particular reference to Nepal. The challenges of terrace agriculture in these regions include lack of quality land area for agriculture, erosion and loss of soil fertility, low yield, poor access to agricultural inputs and services, lack of mechanization, labor shortages, poverty, and illiteracy. Agronomic strategies that could help address these concerns include intensification of terraces using agro-ecological approaches along with introduction of light-weight, low-cost, and purchasable tools and affordable inputs that enhance productivity and reduce female drudgery. To package, deliver, and share these technologies with remote hillside communities, effective scaling up models are required. One opportunity to enable distribution of these products could be to ""piggy-back"" onto pre-existing snackfood/cigarette/alcohol distribution networks that are prevalent even in the most remote mountainous regions of the world. Such strategies, practices, and tools could be supported by formalized government policies dedicated to the well-being of terrace farmers and ecosystems, to maintain resiliency at a time of alarming climate change. We hope this review will inform governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector to draw attention to this neglected and vulnerable agro-ecosystem in developing countries.";"Chapagain, Tejendra

because poor people are expelled from the territory. This article explores the case of the cattle region of Chontales, Nicaragua, which
during 1998–2005 experienced economic growth and declining poverty rates, spurred by investments and organizational development.
The article argues that in the absence of pro-poor coalitions, these investments facilitated the return and strengthening of the local elite
and that the observed decline in poverty rates emerges as the result of dispossession and subsequent exodus of the poor rather than of
inclusive economic growth.";"Munk Ravnborg, Helle

Water grabbing has serious implications for basic human rights including the right to water, food, health, livelihood, and self-determination. Land grabbing is driven by the desire to control and use water and fisheries resources. Globally, Uganda is among the 25 countries most affected by water grabbing. The Katosi Women Development Trust documents effects of land grabbing in four communities in Mpunge sub-county in Mukono district, conducting action research studies in selected fishing communities in Uganda, investigating the drivers of land and water grabbing.";"";"";"";"International Development Research Centre";"2017-09-30";"en";"land governance;land grabbing;land rights;land tenure;smallholders";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"202;UGA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/56779";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/56779/2/IDL-56779.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/56779/4/IDL-56779.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"SMALL SCALE FISHERIES;WATER GRABBING;LAND GRABBING;LAND TENURE;NATURAL RESOURCE CONFLICTS;LAND GOVERNANCE;UGANDA;SOUTH OF SAHARA;WATER RESOURCES;LAND RIGHTS;RIGHT TO NATURAL RESOURCES CONTROL;LOCAL GOVERNANCE;GRASS ROOTS GROUPS;SMALLHOLDERS;WOMEN`S ORGANIZATIONS;LEGAL FRAMEWORK;LAND ACQUISITION";""

"IDRC:10625/50876";"Access to land and land based resources among women in pastoralist and forest-dependent communities in East Africa : exploring multiple exclusions and their impacts on women’s citizenship; final technical report";"";"The security of women’s entitlement to land and land-based resources in the East Africa region has been compromised by a combination of unfavourable laws and government policies, socio-economic change toward greater commoditization of and competition for land and land-based resources, and exclusionary practices defended as ‘customary’. Law, policy, and practice have excluded women in land ownership and control and made their access tenuous. Yet land and resources linked to it form a critical part of pastoral and forest dependent communities’ life lines and lack of access to these resources can lead to the decimation of the affected communities because their livelihoods are linked to particular landscapes. For women in such communities, this exclusion is exacerbated by the marginalisation of the entire community polity in national policies generally. Gender within this context comprises an additional layer of exclusion. This research sought to explore access to land and land based resources among women in the Hadza, Batwa, Maasai, Ogiek and Karamojong communities (representing pastoralist and forest-dependent communities in East Africa) while exploring multiple exclusions and their impacts on women’s citizenship. It specifically sought to understand and make proposals on how best to secure the rights to land and land-based resources for women in these communities, in view of the fact that they have to negotiate between multiple citizenships. The research was carried out using desk-based (review of literature) and field-based methods (social mapping, surveys, interviews and focus group discussions) to elicit a contextual understanding of how women’s marginalization among the Hadza, Batwa, Maasai, Ogiek and Karamojong is generated, entrenched and rationalized. The deepened and contextual understanding was to help us inform advocacy initiatives and engage with government policies both at local, national and regional levels.";"Kameri-Mbote, Patricia";"";"";"International Development Research Centre";"2012-12-31";"en";"corruption;customary law;land;land ownership;land tenure;land use;women";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Corruption;Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"014";"Reports & Research";"http://hdl.handle.net/10625/50876";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/50876/1/IDL-50876.pdf";"https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/10625/50876/3/IDL-50876.pdf.jpg";"";"";"";"ACCESS;CONTROL;PARTICIPATION;CITIZENSHIP;EXCLUSION;LAND;LAND RELATED RESOURCES;WOMEN;GOVERNMENT POLICY;GENDER EQUALITY;WOMEN'S RIGHTS;CORRUPTION;LAND OWNERSHIP;CUSTOMARY LAW;GENDER DISCRIMINATION;GOVERNMENT POLICY;LAND USE;LAND TENURE;EAST AFRICA";""

questions: (1) what factors determine territorial development dynamics that lead to economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved
income distribution? (2) What can be done to stimulate this kind of territorial dynamics? We highlight five “bundles of factors” that we
found in 19 case studies of territorial development 1, as well as the role of social territorial coalitions that appear to be necessary for
territorial dynamics that lead to economic growth with social inclusion. The article calls for territorial development policies to
complement sectoral policies.";"Berdegué, Julio A.
