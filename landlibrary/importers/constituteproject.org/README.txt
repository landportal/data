=) Generate constitution's title
Generated by python script using a JSON file from https://www.constituteproject.org/service/constitutions 

1) Upload to a graph in a triplestore:
- metadata.nt (Constitute project triples) download from https://www.constituteproject.org/metadata.nt
- ontology.owl (FAO geopolitical ontology enhanced) download from https://www.constituteproject.org/ontology.xml
- generated-constitutions-title.ttl (Titles for the constitutions previously generated)
- fao-geopolitical-update.ttl (ISO3 codes for missed countries. Generated manually)

2) Query using the CONSTRUCT SPARQL query (constitutions-generate-RDF-construct.sparql)

3) Re-generate RDF with the nodes "ordered" (just syntactically)
Run the script "sort-xml.py" using the proper variable's values.

4) Compare the results with the previous RDF/XML in order to find the updates (and maybe some encoding issues), and
generate a "update-constitutions.rdf" file
