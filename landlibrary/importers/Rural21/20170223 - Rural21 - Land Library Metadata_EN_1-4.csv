1;Land governance;Rural21-Vol:50-Nr:3/2016-Article:1;Improving land governance – for the sake of the rural poor;Land and associated property is a major source of individuals’ identity and livelihood. The way in which land rights are assigned and can be used is a key determinant of equality of opportunity, environmental sustainability, social/economic transformation, and the ease and extent of public service provision. This article discusses why land rights are important but often only weakly protected and describes how recent technological developments make public efforts to secure such rights much easier – with tangible impacts for rural development.;Klaus W.

However, most agricultural projects do not address child labour, even though they have the potential to contribute to its prevention and reduction. Raising awareness about project impacts on child labour and the inclusion of child labour issues in the planning, monitoring and evaluation process of agricultural projects is one promising way to tackle child labour in agriculture, as emonstrated by a study in Cambodia.;"Heidi Feldt; Elen Ambros; Lena Bullerdieck; Robin Cordes; Leonie Craes
