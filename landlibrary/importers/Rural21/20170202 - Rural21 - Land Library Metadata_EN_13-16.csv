1;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:1;Water and adaptation to climate change;Developing countries, as a group, are the ones most threatened by the hydrological impacts of global climate change. Water is a critical resource in development, and it is affected by climate change in multiple, complex ways ? through changes in temperature and rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, and melting snowfields and glaciers.;"Mark Svendsen

3;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:3;Do we need to worry about water in the Amazon?;The economy of the Amazon region relies heavily on water for transport and livelihoods. Important also for the regional water cycle, the Amazon ecosystems are threatened by climate change, although there is little knowledge about the likelihood of adverse events and potentially related vulnerabilities. Therefore research and building up capacities for collective action are cornerstones of adaptation to climate change. Since 2008, strategic policy approaches have emerged.

4;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:4;Impact of climate change on the Nile river basin;The River Nile provides an invaluable source of livelihoods to over 160 million of people who dwell in its valley. The river valley is renowned for being a cradle of civilisation. As the populations grew and civilisation evolved, the demand for more water resources took a toll in the region. The more recent visible climate change effects have further compounded water management in the basin. Water and food security in the region is under threat, hence the need for robust transboundary water management. An effective institutional arrangement is a key factor in facilitating this process.;"Tom Waako; Simon Thuo; Audace Ndayizeye";Nile Basin Initiative;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2009/07;English;"climate change; water management; natural resources management; food security";"Land, Climate change & Environment; Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;Egypt;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2009-04en/focus/impact-of-climate-change-on-the-nile-river-basin/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/R21_Impact_of_climate_change_on_the_Nile..._0409_01.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2009-04_en.jpg;All rights reserved

6;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:6;Water harvesting for home food security;Poverty in rural households have deepened in the past two years through world events: unprecedented rises in food and fuel prices were followed by global economic meltdown, all amidst growing climate uncertainty. Balancing water availability within and across growing seasons, water harvesting helps to buffer households against drought. Research on water harvesting in South Africa has focused on rural household livelihoods. Innovative results on appropriate water harvesting technologies and food security facilitation techniques are now being implemented in villages across South Africa.  ;"Marna de Lange; Erna Kruger; CM Stimie";;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2009/07;English;"climate change; water management; poverty; rural population; rural development; research; food security; farming systems";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;South Africa;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2009-04en/focus/water-harvesting-for-home-food-security/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/R21_Water_harvesting_0409.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2009-04_en.jpg;All rights reserved
7;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:7;How do small farmers respond to climate change in Rajasthan?;Water is scarce in India's semiarid zones of Rajasthan. Climate change is putting additional pressure on the rare resources. Irregular or no rainfall forces many small farmers to abandon their fields, at least temporarily, and seek work in the towns. Participative water management projects as practiced in Bhipur village, growing crops with low water requirements and more sustainable farming practices are adaptation strategies that allow farmers to continue their activities despite climate risks. Such adaptation approaches are vital for the future in order to prevent the rural exodus and guarantee food security for the population. ;"Kaspar Akermann; Lea Herberg; Anna Kalisch";GIZ;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2009/07;English;"water rights; water management; climate change; natural resources management; farmers; farming systems; sustainable land management; rural development; food security";"Land, Climate change & Environment; Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;India;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2009-04en/focus/how-do-small-farmers-respond-to-climate-change-in-rajasthan/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/R21_How_do_small_farmers_respond..._0409.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2009-04_en.jpg;All rights reserved
8;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:8;Knowledge management pays dividends;Many adaptation measures urgently needed in agriculture today as a consequence of climate change concern water in agriculture and were already devised and implemented in the 1980s as a part of rural development activities. However, most of the experience and knowledge have sunk without trace. Systematic knowledge management at that time would have made it possible to benefit from this experience today in the planning and implementation of water-related adaptation measures, providing effective support for these measures and hastening their implementation. In addition good knowledge management ensures that recent and relevant knowledge can be quickly accessed and put to use.;Artur Vallentin;GIZ;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2009/07;English;"agriculture; climate change; water management; farming systems";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;Global;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2009-04en/opinion/knowledge-management-pays-dividends/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/R21_Knowledge_management_pays_dividends_0409.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2009-04_en.jpg;All rights reserved
9;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:9;Foreign direct investments in land in developing countries;The world food crisis has spurred foreign direct investments (FDI) into arable land in developing countries. While significant financial inflows into agricultural sectors could be beneficial on a global scale, it could negatively affect local livelihoods. This article provides an overview of the different types of FDI in land. In addition, examples of investment flows are illustrated in an overview and a sustainable impact matrix outlines the occurring effects. Finally, requirements of avoiding negative effects are presented, to achieve a Pareto-efficient win-win situation. ;"Matthias Bickel; Dr Thomas Breuer";GIZ;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2009/07;English;"food security; land investments; agriculture; local community; rural population; land; land rights; land deals";Land & Investments;Land Use, Management & Investment;Global;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2009-04en/international-platform/foreign-direct-investments-in-land-in-developing-countries/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/R21_Foreign_direct_investments_0409.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2009-04_en.jpg;All rights reserved
10;Water and climate change;Rural21-Vol:43-Nr:4/2009-Article:10;Development policy and security policy: An alliance with conflict (management) potential;In Germany, the debate about the security/development nexus is gathering pace. The reality of life in crisis regions, the management of post-conflict situations and the precautionary anticipation of demands arising in the context of crisis management all require the highest level of coordination at political and local level and on a cross-sectoral basis. Long-term improvement of this coordination, both vertical and horizontal, is the most important resource factor for these two policy areas and can be achieved without mobilising additional budget funds. As one ' by no means insignificant ' outcome, coordinated activities can lay reservations to rest that may otherwise prevail among the various actors working in crisis regions.;"Axel v.

1;The urban-rural bias;Rural21-Vol:13-Nr:1/2008-Article:1;Mitigating rural-urban disparities in China and India;The early development strategies of both China and India were urban- and industry-focused, discounting the importance of rural development. Despite sweeping reforms in both countries, the urban bias and subsequent spatial disparities still exist today. In order to reduce poverty and increase growth, developing countries need to correct these spatial disparities through a set of policies that take advantage of the synergies and linkages between rural and urban areas.;"Shenggen Fan; Joanna Brzeska";International Food Policy Research Institute;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2008/01;English;"urbanization; land reform; rural development; poverty; urban population; land policies; urban areas";Urban Tenure;Land Policy & Legislation;"China; India";Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2008-01en/focus/mitigating-rural-urban-disparities-in-china-and-india/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/R21_Mitigating_rural-urban_disparities...0108.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2008-01_en.jpg;All rights reserved
2;The urban-rural bias;Rural21-Vol:13-Nr:1/2008-Article:2;Kenya: thriving green crops with no economic impact;Kenya is still largely agrarian with 80 percent of its population depending on agriculture for food, employment and income. The dilemma facing the country is that only 20 percent of the land is suited for agricultural production. A greater proportion of the country, however, consists of agroecologically less favoured areas (LFAs). Another dilemma in Kenya?s agricultural sector is that economic development impacts are not homogeneously spread even among the agriculturally favoured areas. For rural development government policies need to include developing infrastructure and institutions to open up the economically less favoured areas.;Professor Mark O.

A massive UN peacekeeping mission managed to demobilize the combatants in 2002 and peace was restored. Public institutions have begun to resume their functions and the economy is showing signs of recovery. Nonetheless, the country's stability and structures are still fragile.

16;Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food;Rural21-Vol:13-Nr:2/2006-Article:16;The links between urban and rural prosperity in low- and middle-income nations. Cities benefit from a prosperous agriculture;Although «urban» and «rural» development are often considered as in opposition to each other and seen as competing with each other for investment and support, many urban centres owe much of their economic base to agriculture. Ironically, one of the best tests of whether rural development is working is whether local urban centres are booming - as increasing agricultural output is served by markets and producer services there, and as real increases in income for a wide range of rural households are reflected in increased demand for goods and services provided by urban-based enterprises.;"David Satterthwaite;

The role of circular migration in economic growth;Rural livelihoods are far more multi-locational than is often assumed with many rural people spending a part of the year outside the village working in non-farm occupations. Contrary to early theory, persistent circular or seasonal migration within countries or between neighbouring countries is emerging as the migration pattern of the poor.

It is now often difficult to clearly define the borders between the two; instead we find a continuum ranging from agricultural zones to suburbs, informal settlements and urban centers.

Although ICTs may seem a fragile basis on which to build far-reaching change, a meeting organized by CTA showed that they can speed up the exchange of knowledge and ideas between urban centres and rural communities. In countries struggling to maintain basic amenities, it is the towns that interface most closely with global society.

Changing demand, as a consequence of urbanization, emergence of «modern» consumption patterns or new trends in international trade, impacts on rural areas along value chains and spills over to marketing and production systems.These rural urban linkages bear challenges but also mutual benefits for producers and consumers and can be promising entry points for development interventions.This is illustrated with the case of the Kenyan potato value chain.;"Heike Höffler; Gladys Maingi";;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2006/7;English;"agriculture; rural development; urbanization; food security; agricultural land management; farming systems";Urban Tenure;Land Use, Management & Investment;Kenya;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/archiv-2005-2011/archive2006-02en/;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/ELR_Promoting_agricultural_value_chains_0206.pdf;private://feeds/Rural21_2006-02_en.jpg;All rights reserved
