2;Family Farming;Rural21-Vol:48-Nr:2/2014-Article:2;More than just a business;Family farming has many different meanings to many different people. While such farms come in all shape and sizes, one thing all practitioners agree on is that family farming is more than a business – it’s a way of life. The following article shows what constitutes this way of life, the challenges that family farms in Europe and throughout the world face and why and how the European Union supports this type of enterprise.;;"European Network for Rural Development; Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development - European Commission";DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2014/06;English;"farming systems; farmers; rural development; agriculture; agricultural land management; development agencies";Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land Use, Management & Investment;"Europe; Global";Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/current-issue/detail/article/more-than-just-a-business-00001155/;http://www.rural21.com/uploads/media/rural2014_02-S08-10.pdf;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/img/content/Issue/En-2014-02/Seite08.jpg;All rights reserved
3;Family Farming;Rural21-Vol:48-Nr:2/2014-Article:3;What is so special about family farms?;Family farms are especially well suited to meet the challenges of labour organisation in agriculture. In early stages of development, they play a particularly important role in creating productive employment for the major share of the population. Moreover, they have strong incentives to use their resources sustainably so as to pass them on to future generations. Yet, family farms should not be romanticised. Often, they only survive by working longer hours and accepting lower incomes than people employed in other sectors of the economy.;Regina Birner;;DLG-Verlag;Rural21;2014/06;English;"farmers; farming systems; agriculture; agricultural land management; rural population; sustainable land management";Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land Use, Management & Investment;Global;Journal Articles & Books;http://www.rural21.com/english/current-issue/detail/article/what-is-so-special-about-family-farms-00001154/;http://www.rural21.com/uploads/media/rural2014_02-S11-13.pdf;http://www.rural21.com/fileadmin/img/content/Issue/En-2014-02/Seite11.jpg;All rights reserved
