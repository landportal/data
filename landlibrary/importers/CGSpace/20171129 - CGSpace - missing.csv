handle:10568/67580;The rising challenge of water resources management at the urban fringes - evidence from Ferghana district of Uzbekistan [Abstract only];;"With the global expansion of urban areas, competition over both land and water resources is steadily increasing, especially within developing countries(FAO 2012; Kuslu 2007; CER 2009). The expansion of urban areas into agricultural areas, such as in Uzbekistan, has created competition for water between farmers and non-farmers (FAO 2002, 2005). Subsequent growth of urban and peri-urban areas envisages new and expanded demands for water resources, entailing both reproductive and productive uses especially by the poor (Drechsel et al. 2006; van Koppen et al. 2006). The integration of these other, competing uses into the planning or proper design of water provision and management systems has been lacking (van Koppen et al. 2006). The agricultural sector, being the former most dominant sector in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) was the core provider of employment and basic livelihoods. After independence in 1991, Uzbekistan experienced a political and economic transition, which resulted in transformation of water land as well as water management and social and institutional challenges, particularly for the agricultural sector. Here a case study on the urbanizing Ferghana district in Uzbekistan is presented which highlights rising competition for water and the associated gender dimensions of the changing water management structure. While traditionally Water User Associations (WUAs) are set up to govern and manage water resources for farmers, the urban expansion into agricultural areas means that WUAs now must integrate the concerns of nonfarmers and multiple water uses in peri-urban communities. Given the expansion and increased importance of kitchen gardens for the majority of the rural population for livelihood security, it is necessary to reprioritize on their respective water needs and towards better integration in WUAs. Donors as well as the government have to adapt their policies, project and recommendations to these changes.";"Mukhamedova, Nozilakhon

handle:10568/67590;Simple power-law models to predict flow metrics for water resource and risk management along the Mekong tributaries. [Abstract only];;Increasing demographic pressure, economic development and resettlement policies in the Lower Mekong Basin induce greater population dependency on river flow to satisfy growing domestic and agricultural water demands. This dependency is particularly tight in upland areas where alternative water resources (groundwater) are scarce. As a result, communities tend to live closer to rivers, and so are more vulnerable to floods. This situation requires improved knowledge of flow variability for better management of water resources and risks. Unfortunately, stream flow measurements are scarce, especially in remote areas inhabited by the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Several water resource models have been developed to simulate and predict flows in the Lower Mekong Basin. However, most of these models have been designed to predict flow along the Mekong mainstream, precluding accurate assessments in headwater catchments. In most cases, their complexity and lack of transparency restricts potential users to modelling experts, and largely excludes those practitioners working closely with affected populations. The most integrated and informative way to characterize flow, at a specific location on a river, is to compute a flow duration curve which provides the percentage of time (duration) any particular flow is exceeded over a historical period. Using hydro-meteorological records from more than 60 gauged catchments in the Lower Mekong Basin, and a 90-meter digital elevation model, we used multiple linear regressions to develop power-law models predicting flow duration curves. These simple equations allow assessment of low, medium and high flow metrics, at any point on rivers in the Lower Mekong Basin, using easily determined geomorphological and climate characteristics. We believe that this parsimonious, transparent and highly predictive tool (89% <R2< 95%) can be used by a wide range of practitioners working in the fields of livelihood, water infrastructure engineering and agriculture.;"Lacombe, Guillaume

handle:10568/34539;Investir dans la gestion de l eau en agriculture au profit des petits exploitants agricoles du Burkina Faso.;;"This Working Paper summarizes research conducted as part of the AgWater Solutions Project in Burkina Faso between 2009 and 2012. Researchers from the AgWater Solutions Project examined the potential for small reservoirs, inland valley cultivation and the use of motorized pumps. The main findings indicate that (1) Small reservoirs need better management at all stages to reduce costs and improve equity.Costs could be comparable with other AWM options. The total investment to reach 50% of the potential demand in Burkina Faso could be as much as USD 1,136 million. Costs could be reduced by tightly controlling planning, implementation and management, and should be compared with all the benefits over the lifetime of the reservoir. If implemented, some 321,000 households are likely to benefit; (2) Inland valleys, commonly known as bas fonds, can be used to increase rice cultivation as well as other crops through improved water management, agronomic and post-harvest practices. Investment in physical infrastructure and extension could amount to USD 384 million; (3) Motor pumps can increase yields and incomes, but problems in areas, such as financing, cost reduction of electricity supply, distance to pump suppliers, poor operation practices and maintenance, and environmental damage need to be addressed. Motor pumps used upstream of reservoirs can support profitable dry-season vegetable cultivation, but care must be taken regarding over-abstraction, pollution and conflicts. Greater adoption of motor pumps could benefit some 332,000 farming households irrigating up to 4% of the total agricultural land area at a total investment cost of USD 121 million; and (4) Combination of a range of agricultural water management options ? capture/storage+ lifting + irrigation technologies + soil conservation + watershed management ? arerecommended to enable supplementary irrigation in areas where dry spells become a common occurrence.";"Evans, A.
