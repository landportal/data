"handle:10568/89929";"Gender and the commons: Pastoral women’s land rights and village land use planning in Tanzania: Experiences from the sustainable rangeland management project";"";"In pastoral societies women face many challenges. Some describe these as a ‘double burden’ –
that is, as pastoralists and as women. However, pastoral women may obtain a significant degree
of protection from customary law even if customary institutions are male-dominated. In periods
of change (economic, social, political), this protection may be lost, and without protection from
statutory laws, women are in danger of “falling between two stools” (Adoko and Levine 2009). A
study carried out in four villages in Tanzania, supported by the International Land Coalition,
sought to understand the challenges and opportunities facing pastoral women with respect to
accessing land and resources, in the context of village land use planning. This research presents
empirical data on pastoral women’s land rights, shedding light on some of the details of these
and their manifestation considering the differing contexts, land use patterns, and nature of
rights to land. There are some common themes – particularly around the challenges facing
women in pastoral communities including lack of space to make their views heard, lack of
awareness of their rights, coupled with broader governance challenges. New processes
underway such as a government-led review of Tanzania’s land policy and the accompanied
implementation strategy ,the new land policy provide opportunities to overcome these
challenges.";"Kisambu, N.

"handle:10568/89924";"Trade-Offs in Multi-Purpose Land Use under Land Degradation";"";"Land provides a host of ecosystem services, of which the provisioning services are often considered paramount. As the demand for agricultural products multiplies, other ecosystem services are being degraded or lost entirely. Finding a sustainable trade-off between food production and one or more of other ecosystem services, given the variety of stakeholders, is a matter of optimizing land use in a dynamic and complex socio-ecological system. Land degradation reduces our options to meet both food demands and environmental needs. In order to illustrate this trade-off dilemma, four representative services, carbon sinks, water storage, biodiversity, and space for urbanization, are discussed here based on a review of contemporary literature that cuts across the domain of ecosystem services that are provided by land. Agricultural research will have to expand its focus from the field to the landscape level and in the process examine the cost of production that internalizes environmental costs. In some situations, the public cost of agriculture in marginal environments outweighs the private gains, even with the best technologies in place. Land use and city planners will increasingly have to address the cost of occupying productive agricultural land or the conversion of natural habitats. Landscape designs and urban planning should aim for the preservation of agricultural land and the integrated management of land resources by closing water and nutrient cycles, and by restoring biodiversity.";"Vlek, Paul L.G.

"handle:10568/89927";"Joint Village Land Use Planning in Tanzania: A process to enhance the securing of rangelands and resolving land use conflicts";"";"In Tanzania, ongoing land insecurity is a structural cause of food insecurity particularly for
pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and small-scale crop farmers leading to land use conflicts,
compromised access to resources including grazing and water and rangeland degradation.
Land tenure security and management can be improved through village land use planning (VLUP)
and land certification – namely the issuing of certificates of customary rights of occupancy
(CCROs). In situations where villages share resources such as grazing areas and water, joint village
land use planning and the provision of group CCROs are more appropriate. Due to a lack of
resources and capacity the implementation of these has been limited to date and particularly in
‘difficult’ areas where land use conflicts occur. Indeed only about 1.28 million hectares or 2.1%
of the 60 million hectares of rangelands is protected as grazing in village land use plans [in 479
villages in 69 districts] (21 regions) (Ministry of Lands 2015). Between 2010-2015 the Sustainable
Rangeland Management Project (SRMP) assisted nine villages to carry out village land use
planning, and successfully piloted the implementation of joint village planning across three of
these, leading to the protection through certification of a shared grazing area called OLENGAPA,
found in Kiteto District, Manyara Region. This paper describes these experiences, and the
opportunities for scaling-up and eventually mainstreaming.";"Mwita, V.C.

The knowledge and eco-types descriptions were collected from participatory mapping and focus group discussions with 77 participants from Mapungu, Lealui, and Nalitoya. We used two Landsat 8 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken in March 24th and July 14th, 2014 (path 175, row 71) to calculate water level and vegetation type which are the two main criteria used by Lozi People for differentiating eco-types. We calculated water levels by using the Water Index (WI) and vegetation type by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also calculated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. We excluded burned areas in 2014 and built areas to reduce classification error. Control points include field data from 99 farmers’ fields, 91 plots of 100 m2 and 65 waypoints randomly selected in a 6 km radius around each village. We also used Google Earth Pro to create control points in areas flooded year-round (e.g., deep waters and large canals), patches of forest and built areas. The eco-type map has a classification accuracy of 81% and a pixel resolution of 30 m. The eco-type map provides a useful resource for agriculture and conservation planning at the landscape level in the Barotse Floodplain.";"Del Rio, T.

It reduces soil fertility of agro-ecosystems located on hillslopes, and it degrades, downstream, water resource quality and leads to the siltation of reservoirs. An increase in the surface area covered with commercial perennial monocultures such as teak plantations is currently observed at the expanse of traditional slash-andburn cultivation systems in steep montane environments of these regions. The impacts of land-use change on the hydrological response and sediment yields have been investigated in a representative catchment of Laos monitored for 13 years. After the gradual conversion of rice-based shifting cultivation to teak plantation-based systems, overland flow contribution to stream flow increased from 16 to 31% and sediment yield raised from 98 to 609 Mg km-2. This result is explained by the higher kinetic energy of raindrops falling from the canopy, the virtual absence of understorey vegetation cover to dissipate drop energy and the formation of an impermeable surface crust accelerating the formation and concentration of overland flow. The 25-to-50% lower 137Cs activities measured in soils collected under mature teak plantations compared to soils under other land uses illustrate the severity of soil erosion processes occurring in teak plantations.";"Ribolzi, Olivier

However, the history of sheep and the associated nomadic societies in ancient China remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the genomic diversity of Chinese sheep using genome-wide SNPs, mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal variations in > 1,000 modern samples. Population genomic analyses combined with archeological records and historical ethnic demographics data revealed genetic signatures of the origins, secondary expansions and admixtures, of Chinese sheep thereby revealing the peopling patterns of nomads and the expansion of early pastoralism in East Asia. Originating from the Mongolian Plateau ∼5,000‒5,700 years ago, Chinese sheep were inferred to spread in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River ∼3,000‒5,000 years ago following the expansions of the Di-Qiang people. Afterwards, sheep were then inferred to reach the Qinghai-Tibetan and Yunnan-Kweichow plateaus ∼2,000‒2,600 years ago by following the north-to-southwest routes of the Di-Qiang migration. We also unveiled two subsequent waves of migrations of fat-tailed sheep into northern China, which were largely commensurate with the migrations of ancestors of Hui Muslims eastward and Mongols southward during the 12th‒13th centuries. Furthermore, we revealed signs of argali introgression into domestic sheep, extensive historical mixtures among domestic populations and strong artificial selection for tail type and other traits, reflecting various breeding strategies by nomadic societies in ancient China.";"Yong-Xin Zhao

Pairwise (Pearson) correlations were estimated using bodyweight (BW) and morphological trait measurements, namely heart girth (HG), shoulder height (SH), and body condition score (BCS) for a sample of 1447 goats and 588 sheep. These ranged from 0.19 to 0.94 for goats and 0.44 to 0.94 for sheep, and were statistically significant. In both animals, regardless of sex, the highest positive correlations were found between BW and HG, followed by BW and SH, then BW and BCS. The direct and indirect relationship between BW and morphological traits using a path analysis approach were also estimated. This analysis suggested that the direct effect of HG on BW was higher at 0.761 for male and 0.662 for female goats, respectively. Similarly, the direct effect of HG on BW was higher among sheep at 0.764 for males and 0.882 for females. The direct effects of SH in all the animals were also positively influenced by BW. It was concluded that among these three morphological traits, the most valuable for estimating the BW for goats and sheep in Botswana is HG, followed by SH. BCS was found non-significant. Path analysis therefore has an advantage over previous empirical studies by providing more detailed information on the relationships (direct and indirect) between these variables. A further implication of this study is that a conversion table could be constructed to help smallholder farmers to estimate the live weight of their sheep and goats from linear measurements. This would aid in the management and marketing of their livestock.";"Temoso, O.

"handle:10568/81234";"Agriculture under changing climate conditions and adaptation options in the Koshi Basin";"";"Using biophysical and social analysis methods, this paper evaluated agricultural practices under changing climate in the Koshi Basin and assessed adaptation options. Agricultural trend analysis showed that in the recent three to four decades, the total cultivated area had declined in all parts of the basin except in the Nepal Mountain Region. Household survey results also confirmed such decline and further revealed shifts towards non-agricultural activities. Climate trend analysis showed changes in the frequency of wet and dry days in study districts, implying an increasing chance of flood and drought events. Household surveys further revealed that, in general, people perceived a decline in agricultural water availability and an increase in drought and flood events. The direct impacts of these changes were reduced crop yield, increased fallow lands, displacement of people from settlement areas, sedimentation of cultivable land and damage to properties. Household surveys showed that despite the perceived impacts on agriculture and livelihoods, only limited adaptation options are currently practised. Adaptation efforts are constrained by several factors, including: finance; technical knowledge; lack of awareness about adaptation options; lack of collective action; unclear property rights; and ineffective role of state agencies.";"Bastakoti, Ram C.

"handle:10568/81231";"A regional scale ecological risk framework for environmental flow evaluations";"";"Recent developments in Environmental Flow (E-flow) frameworks advocate holistic, regional scale, probabilistic E-flow assessments that consider flow and non-flow drivers of change in socio-ecological context as best practice. Regional Scale ecological risk assessments of multiple sources, stressors and diverse ecosystems that address multiple social and ecological endpoints, have been undertaken internationally at different spatial scales using the relative-risk model since the mid 1990's. With the recent incorporation of Bayesian belief networks into the relative-risk model, a robust regional scale ecological risk assessment approach is available that can contribute to achieving the best practice recommendations of E-flow frameworks. PROBFLO is a regional scale, holistic E-flow assessment method that incorporates the relative-risk model and Bayesian belief networks (BN-RRM) into a transparent probabilistic modelling tool that addresses uncertainty explicitly. PROBFLO has been developed to holistically evaluate the socio-ecological consequences of historical, current and future altered flows in the context of non-flow drivers and generate E-flow requirements on regional scales spatial scales. The approach has been implemented in two regional scale case studies in Africa where its flexibility and functionality has been demonstrated. In both case studies the evidence based outcomes facilitated informed environmental management decision making, in the context of social and ecological aspirations. This paper presents the PROBFLO approach as applied to the Senqu River catchment in Lesotho and further developments and application in the Mara River catchment in Kenya and Tanzania. The ten BN-RRM procedural steps incorporated in PROBFLO are demonstrated with examples from both case studies. Outcomes allowed stakeholders to consider sustainable social and ecological E-flow trade-offs between social and ecological endpoints. PROBFLO can be incorporated into adaptive management processes and contribute to the sustainable management of the use and protection of water resources.";"O'Brien, G.C.

"handle:10568/98380";"Climate change adaptation through the water-energy-food nexus in southern Africa";"";"Climate change is a complex and cross-cutting problem that needs an integrated and transformative systems approach to respond to the challenge. Current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development. Regional and international literature on climate change adaptation opportunities and challenges applicable to southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective was reviewed. Specifically, this review highlights climate change impacts on water, energy, and food resources in southern Africa, while exploring mitigation and adaptation opportunities. The review further recommends strategies to develop cross-sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient communities. Regional WEF nexus related institutions and legal frameworks were also reviewed to relate the WEF nexus to policy. Southern Africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in climate change-associated extreme weather events, causing water, food, and energy insecurity. A projected reduction of 20% in annual rainfall by 2080 in southern Africa will only increase the regional socio-economic challenges. This is exacerbating regional resource scarcities and vulnerabilities. It will also have direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human well-being, and health. Reduced agricultural production, lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and clean, sustainable energy are the major areas of concern. The region is already experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). What is clear is that climate change impacts are cross-sectoral and multidimensional, and therefore require cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation approaches. In this regard, a wellcoordinated and integrated WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems, harmonise interventions, and mitigate trade-offs and hence improve sustainability. This would be achieved through greater resource mobilisation and coordination, policy convergence across sectors, and targeting nexus points in the landscape. The WEF nexus approach has potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in southern Africa by contributing towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13).";"Mpandeli, S.

At many sites, government or development-led interventions to promote CSA practices face low adoption rates or are not adopted at all.

Data shows that CSA adoption depends on drivers and constraints beyond the CSA practices. Blanket adoption of a specific intervention should never be assumed: the adoption of CSA practices is usually patchy because of many conditions.

Some drivers of adoption, such as market access or climate variability, are universally positive across countries and regions, creating a positive environment for adoption. Other drivers are important in site-specific contexts.

Investing in understanding and communicating drivers and the conditions under which specific interventions are likely to thrive could increase adoption rates and overall return on investments.";"Läderach, Peter

Lake Conway Point Remove (LCPR) watershed was identified as one of the watersheds for the MRBI program implementation. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MRBI program in LCPR watershed using a computer simulation model. Seven best management practices (BMPs) (pond, wetland, pond and wetland, cover crops, vegetative filter strips, grassed waterways and forage and biomass planting) were modelled under four placement strategies: random placement in 30% of the watershed, random placement in 30% hydrologic response units (HRUs) of the high priority hydrological unit code (HUCs), placement in the top 30% of the high priority HUCs, and top 30% of the HRUs in the HUCs near the outlet of the watershed. The model was calibrated for flow for the period 1987–2006 and validated for the period 2007–2012. Sediment and nutrients were validated from 2011 to 2012. Out of the BMPs evaluated, grassed waterways proved to be the most effective BMP in reducing sediment and nutrient loads from row crop (soy beans) and pasture fields. Reductions at the watershed outlet ranged 0–1% for flow, 0.28–14% for sediment, 0.3–10% for TP and 0.3–9% for TN. Relatively higher reductions were observed at the subwatershed level, flow reductions ranged 0–51%, sediment reductions -1 to 79%, TP -1 to 65% and TN -0.37 to 66% depending on BMP type, placement scenario, and watershed characteristics. The results from this study provide the data to help prioritize monitoring needs for collecting watershed response data in LCPR and BMP implementation evaluations, which could be used to inform decisions in similar studies.";"Leh, Mansoor D.K.

This country profile provides a snapshot of a developing baseline created to initiate discussion, both within countries and globally, about entry points for investing in CSA at scale.";"Baca, María

"handle:10568/96612";"Effect of irrigation application on soil and land productivity of wheat under semi-arid environment";"";"A study was conducted in Sargodha, Pakistan during the year 2011 to testify irrigation practices as a method for reclaiming salt affected soil. Field experiments were conducted on saline-sodic and uncultivated land divided into 12 field plots. Six irrigation treatments, each replicated on two field plots, were applied to test the responses of soil and wheat crop yield. Six irrigation treatments combined two variables: (i) source of irrigation (canal water, brackish groundwater and mixed in 50:50 proportion) and (ii) irrigation scheduling (fixed-rotation or Traditional Warabandi (TWB) and 75% management-allowed depletion (MAD)). The electrical conductivity (ECe) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of saturated paste extracts of soil were observed at four depth intervals ranging from zero to 90 cm during the four crop growth stages. Only top 15 cm soil layers of field plots could be reclaimed upto the permissible ECe level of < 4 dS/m where canal water was applied for irrigation. In deeper layers (31 to 90cm) the ECe increased from the ambient levels in response to irrigation treatments. The crop yield (wheat grains in kg/ha) was measured from all individual field plots. Canal water application with 75% MAD scheduling proved to be the optimum treatment giving average yield of 1265 kg per hectare while the treatment with groundwater application under TWB showed the lowest average yield (435 kg/ha).";"Bhatti, Muhammad Tousif

"handle:10568/35140";"Literature Review: SWOT Analysis of Bangladesh's Key Water Policy Documents";"";"Water is one of the most critical problems in Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) acknowledges water as a finite resource with tremendous importance for the environment and livelihoods in its National Water Policy (GoB, 1999). The National Water Policy provides a comprehensive policy framework for pressing water issues in Bangladesh such as river basin planning, water rights and allocation, delineation of public and private domains, water supply and sanitation, preservation of the natural environment and the developmental concerns of fisheries, navigation and agriculture. The policy also provides guidance on its economic and financial management (water pricing), participation by stakeholders, decentralized management and delivery structures. In essence, the NWP is the cornerstone that guides water management in the polders of coastal Bangladesh. This SWOT analysis attempts to investigate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the NWP from 1999. Based on the findings from this SWOT-analysis, G3 is enabled to design its own research activities in a way that examines how policy is being translated into practice in the coastal areas. The ultimate aim of such a research approach is to share the findings with the Government of Bangladesh through participatory dissemination workshop both at polder and central levels.";"Dewan, Camelia";"";"";"CGIAR";"2012-01-31";"en";"farming systems;water management;land management";"";"BGD";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/35140";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"36384"

Since the 1970s, this region has experienced intensive groundwater abstraction by smallholder farmers. In 2002, however, the revised Water Law urged local authorities to regulate groundwater use in regions with overdraft. The Case Profile reviews, in detail, the use of smart card machines installed on wells by the local government to control abstraction. The study compares the situation in two counties where local authorities opted for two different types of regulatory mechanisms enabled by the smart cards: Minqin County - where they chose quotas, and Guazhou County - where they opted for a tiered water pricing system.|This Case Profile highlights how the success of smart card machines depends on the design and implementation of the regulatory mechanism behind the machines. In Minqin, quotas have successfully affected farmer's groundwater use practices, whereas in Guazhou, water pricing has had little impact on farmer's individual groundwater use practices. Moreover, the case of Minqin exemplifies that quotas enable equitable water access to all farmers and maintain the buffer function of conjunctive surface water and groundwater use. These are important principles to design effective groundwater regulation policies, both in and outside China.";"Aarnoudse, E.

Global economic losses from land degradation (LD) are as high as USD $10.6 trillion annually. These trends catalyzed a call for avoiding future LD, reducing ongoing LD, and reversing past LD, which has culminated in the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3 which aims to achieve global land degradation neutrality (LDN) by 2030. The political momentum and increased body of scientific literature have led to calls for a ‘new science of LDN’ and highlighted the practical challenges of implementing LDN. The aim of the present study was to derive LDN soil organic carbon (SOC) stock baseline maps by comparing different digital soil mapping (DSM) methods and sampling densities in a case study (Otjozondjupa, Namibia) and evaluate each approach with respect to complexity, cost, and map accuracy. The mean absolute error (MAE) leveled off after 100 samples were included in the DSM models resulting in a cost tradeoff for additional soil sample collection. If capacity is sufficient, the random forest DSM method out-performed other methods, but the improvement from using this more complex method compared to interpolating the soil sample data by ordinary kriging was minimal. The lessons learned while developing the Otjozondjupa LDN SOC baseline provide valuable insights for others who are responsible for developing LDN baselines elsewhere.";"Nijbroek, Ravic P.

Study focus : Intensive development over the past half century across Southeast Asia’s Lower Mekong Basin has inevitably affected natural resources. Large areas have been converted from forests for subsistence and commercial agriculture, and urban development. We implement an innovative approach to screen hydrologic data for detecting impacts of such large-scale changes on hydrological response. In a first step, temporal changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship were assessed using the parsimonious, two-parameter GR2M hydrological model. In a second step, a distribution-free statistical test was applied to detect whether significant changes have occurred in the wet season (high flow) and dry season (low flow) conditions.
New hydrological insights for the region : Our results indicate that the majority of catchments (64% of those considered) with sufficiently long data records exhibited no discernable trends in hydrological response. Those catchments that did exhibit significant trends in hydrological response were fairly evenly split between increasing trends (between 21% and 24%) and decreasing trends (between 15% and 12%) with time. There was a lack of evidence that these changes where brought about by shifts in precipitation or potential evapotranspiration; however, catchments exhibiting significant increasing trends in hydrological behavior were found to have different land cover compositions (lower percentage of forest coverage and subsequently higher paddy rice coverage) than those exhibiting significant decreasing trends. The approach presented here provides a potentially valuable screening method to highlight regions for further investigation of improved mechanistic understanding. Without this connection, we might be blind to future hydrological shifts that can have significant impact on development.";"Lyon, S. W.

"handle:10568/81206";"Estimating water balance of Tegona watershed in southeastern Ethiopia, using SWAT model";"";"Water resource development is certainly the basic and crucial infrastructure for a nation’s sustainable development. To utilize water resources in a sustainable manner, it is necessary to understand the quantity and quality in space and time. This study was initiated with the objective of evaluating the performance and applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in analyzing the influence of hydrologic parameters on the stream flow variability and estimation of monthly water yield at the outlet of Tegona river watershed in Bale mountainous area.. The total 468 km2 area of the watershed was subdivided into 12 sub-basins and 60 hydrologic response units (HRUs). Sensitivity analysis, model calibration and validation were made to evaluate the model performance for simulation of stream flow on monthly time step. The calibrated SWAT model performed well for simulation of monthly stream flow. Statistical model performance measures, coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.71, the Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency (ENS) of 0.77 and Percent difference (D) of 8.33, for monthly calibration and 0.86, 0.83 and -12.25 respectively for validation, indicated good to very good performance of the model simulation. Mean monthly and annual water yield simulated with the calibrated model were found to be 23.7 mm and 284.2 mm, respectively. The model slightly overestimated the flow on most of rainy months. The baseflow separation result indicated that subsurface flow was source of water in the study watershed. Overall, the model demonstrated good performance in capturing the patterns and trend of the observed flow series, which confirmed the appropriateness of the model for future scenario simulation. Therefore, it is recommended that SWAT model can be a potential tool for simulation of stream flow and water balance components of ungauged watershed in the highlands of Ethiopia with similar hydro-meteorological characteristics to Tegona watershed. ";"Woldeyohannes, M.";"Madda Walabu University";"Madda Walabu University";"CGIAR";"2016-06-30";"en";"farming systems;water management";"";"002;ETH;014";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/81206";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"83568"

"handle:10568/96536";"Multiobjective analysis of green-blue water uses in a highly utilized basin: case study of Pangani Basin, Africa";"";"The concept of integrated water resource management (IWRM) attempts to integrate all elements of water resources. Different tools are developed to assist in developing sound IWRM plans. One such tool is multiobjective analysis using an integrated hydro-economic model (IHEM). However, IHEM mainly deals with the optimization of river flow (blue water) in a river basin. This paper linked a distributed model of green water (landscape water uses) in the upper catchment with mainly blue water uses in the lower catchment of the Pangani Basin. The results show that agricultural water use has the highest water productivity and competes with all other objective functions in the catchment. The generation of firm energy competes with the downstream ecosystem requirements. The integrated study shows that improving rainfed cropping through supplementary irrigation has comparable marginal water values to full-scale irrigation but are much higher compared with hydropower. However, hydropower has more benefits if used in conjunction with the environment. The methodological approach has increased the understanding of trade-offs between green and blue water uses that are highly interdependent in African landscapes.";"Kiptala, J. K.

"handle:10568/98285";"Earthworms regulate plant productivity and the efficacy of soil fertility amendments in acid soils of the Colombian Llanos";"";"The Llanos region of Colombia represents one of the last large agricultural frontiers and is undergoing a rapid conversion from naturalized savanna to intensive agriculture with high agrochemical inputs and tillage. This massive land-use conversion has considerable impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity, particularly soil macrofauna, yet the full implications of this land-use shift for long-term agroecosystem productivity are poorly understood. To better elucidate potential land-use change impacts on agricultural production we used experimental microcosms in the greenhouse to evaluate how the common earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus, influences plant growth, nutrient uptake, and key soil properties relative to the application of lime and P fertilizer, both common soil fertility amendments in the region. Additionally, we aimed to explore the potential for interactions between earthworms and these amendments across distinct plant types, the grass Brachiaria decumbens and the legume Phaseolus vulgaris, which display different rooting patterns and nutrient acquisition strategies. Earthworms increased the biomass production of B. decumbens by 180% and N uptake by more than 240%, while P fertilizers and lime additions increased total biomass by less than 30% each for B. decumbens. Effects on P. vulgaris were similar, but less pronounced with earthworms increasing total biomass production by 35% and total plant N content by 70%, while neither lime nor P alone significantly influenced total biomass or N uptake. However, a significant interaction between earthworms and lime enhanced total biomass N content of P. vulgaris by more than 150% relative to microcosms without P. corethrurus, suggesting that earthworms can greatly enhance the efficacy of lime in soils. Additionally, we found that earthworms greatly improved soil aggregation, but only in the presence of plants, and that this effect was most prominent in microcosms with P. vulgaris. When testing treatment effects on soil P availability, only fertilizer P additions significantly influenced resin P, but not microbial biomass P. Our findings suggests the importance of developing management strategies that promote the activity and diversity of earthworms and other soil biota as a means to enhance crop productivity, resource use efficiency and a range of soil-based ecosystem services in the Llanos region and beyond.";"Fonte, Steven J.

"handle:10568/82660";"Land use affects total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate concentrations in tropical montane streams in Kenya";"";"African tropical montane forests are facing fast and dynamic changes in land use. However, the impacts of these changes on stream water quality are understudied. This paper aims at assessing the effect of land use and physical catchment characteristics on stream water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate (NO3-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the Mau Forest, the largest tropical montane forest in Kenya. We conducted five synoptic stream water sampling campaigns at the outlets of 13–16 catchments dominated by either natural forest, smallholder agriculture or commercial tea and tree plantations. Our data show a strong effect of land use on TDN and NO3-N, with highest concentrations in stream water of catchments dominated by tea plantations (1.80 ± 0.50 and 1.62 ± 0.60 mg N l−1, respectively), and lowest values in forested catchments (0.55 ± 0.15 and 0.30 ± 0.08 mg N l−1, respectively). NO3-N concentration increased with stream temperature and specific discharge, but decreased with increasing catchment area. DOC concentrations increased with catchment area and precipitation and decreased with specific discharge, drainage density and topographic wetness index. Precipitation and specific discharge were also strong predictors for DON concentrations, with an additional small positive effect of tree cover. In summary, land use affects TDN and NO3-N concentrations in stream water in the Mau Forest region in Kenya, while DOC and DON were more related to hydrologic regimes and catchment properties. The importance of land use for NO3-N and TDN concentrations emphasizes the risk of increased nitrogen export along hydrological pathways caused by intensified land use and conversion of land to agricultural uses, which might result in deterioration of drinking water quality and eutrophication in surface water in tropical Africa.";"Jacobs, S.R.

Bolivia cuenta con más de 45 millones de hectáreas de bosques, desde los más secos hasta los más húmedos, tanto en tierras bajas como altas; esto equivale a alrededor de 45 a 50% de su territorio. Sin embargo los servicios de ecosistemas proveídos para los mismos (incluyendo suministros) son invisibles en la economía nacional; por ejemplo, no están incluidos en el PIB o en otras estadísticas, y las políticas nacionales para reducir la deforestación y degradación tienen baja prioridad para el gobierno actual. Existen contradicciones e inconsistencias en el Plan de Desarrollo Nacional sobre este tema. Por otro lado, hay experiencias importantes en el país basadas en la práctica de REDD y MRV por parte de las ONG. Bolivia tiene el conocimiento y la capacidad para desarrollar un punto de referencia para REDD, para el monitoreo de la deforestación y de las reservas de carbono a través de una red de trazado. Además tiene abundante información que le puede permitir al país alcanzar un nivel 2 (Tier 2). El desafío más importante para Bolivia es lograr un arreglo institucional que ayude a la red de instituciones que están aplicando MRV-REDD de modo a brindarles un apoyo que les permita continuar trabajando y proveyendo de información al gobierno. Esta red incluye no solo a las instituciones gubernamentales sino también a las no gubernamentales, las cuales tienen la mayor experiencia en Bolivia en términos de MRV-REDD.";"Villegas, Z.

"handle:10568/81979";"Farmer participatory research in soil management and varietal selection in Thailand";"";"A pilot project on the use of Farmer Participatory Research (FPR) methodologies with the objective of enhancing farmer adoption of practices that minimize soil erosion in cassava-based cropping systems, was conducted jointly by DOA and DOAE with technical and financial support from CIAT in two sites in Nakhon Ratchasima and Sra Kaew provinces. The activities involved a preliminary survey using RRA methodologies, the setting out of demonstration plots, as well as farmers meetings and farmers field trips to observe the demonstration plots. The activities also included conducting various types of FPR trials with farmers on their own land and organizing a farmer's field day to harvest these trials, to discuss the results, and to select the best treatments for next-year's trials.
The results revealed that the highest yield of cassava in Soeng Saang district of Nakhorn Ratchasima province was obtained from planting contour barriers of vetiver grass within cassava plots; this practice also resulted in the lowest level of soil erosion. On the contrary, in Wang Nam Yen district of Sra Kaew province, the highest cassava yield was obtained in plots with upand-down ridging, while the lowest level of soil erosion was observed with contour ridging. However, from the discussion between participating farmers and FPR team members it was concluded that the planting of contour barriers of vetiver grass was the most effective method to reduce erosion in the long-term, even though this treatment neither had produced the highest yield of cassava nor the highest income.
Within the same pilot project, FPR trials on cassava varieties and on rates of fertilizer application were conducted in order to motivate farmers to participate m the project. In Wang Nam Yen district, Rayong 90 had the highest yield and ranked second in starch content, while Rayong S had the second highest yield but the highest starch content. In Soeng Saang district, Rayong 90 ranked first in yield and starch content, while Kasetsart 50 ranked second in both yield and starch content. With respect to the fertilizer trials, it was found that in Soeng Saang district the application of 156 kg/ha of 15-15-15 resulted in both the highest yield of cassava and highest net income.";"Vongkasem, V

achieve food security and broader development goals
under a changing climate and increasing food demand.
CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance
resilience, and reduce/remove GHGs, and require planning
to address tradeoffs and synergies between these three
pillars: productivity, adaptation, and mitigation [1]. The
priorities of different countries and stakeholders are reflected
to achieve more efficient, effective and equitable food
systems that address challenges in environmental, social
and economic dimensions across productive landscapes.
While the concept is new, and still evolving, many of the
practices that make up CSA already exist worldwide and are
used by farmers to cope with various production risks [2].
Mainstreaming CSA requires critical stocktaking of ongoing
and promising practices for the future, and of institutional
and financial enablers for CSA adoption. This country profile
provides a snapshot of a developing baseline created to
initiate discussion, both within countries and globally, about
entry points for investing in CSA at scale.";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture

"handle:10568/98859";"Soil carbon under current and improved land management in Kenya, Ethiopia and India: Dynamics and sequestration potentials";"";"Agriculture is a major contributor to climate change,
emitting the three major greenhouse gases (GHGs) –
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide – into the
atmosphere. According to the Fifth Assessment Report of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use sector “is
responsible for just under a quarter (~10–12 Gt CO2eq/yr) of
[all] anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation
and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient
management”. Land use change – often associated with
deforestation – contributes about 11.2% to this share,
while agricultural production is responsible for 11.8%
(IPCC, 2014).
To reduce emissions from agriculture, while providing
and maintaining global food security, there is a growing
interest to develop and promote low-emission greengrowth
pathways for future agricultural production
systems. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces two concerns
in that respect: a) agriculture is the major emitter
of GHGs on this sub-continent, and b) agriculture is
largely underperforming. To feed a growing population,
productivity and total production need to increase
significantly. To achieve this while reducing emissions
from agriculture at the same time is a major challenge.
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) sets out to address this
challenge by transforming agricultural systems affected
by the vagaries of climate change. CSA aims at improving
food security and system’s resilience while addressing
climate change mitigation.";"Sommer, Rolf

"handle:10568/83530";"El boom de la maca, transformando paisajes y sociedades rurales de la zona altoandina.";"";"La maca (Lepidium meyenii) es una raíz andina a la cual se le atribuyen propiedades energéticas y estimulantes. En los últimos años el interés de mercados asiáticos dio lugar al “boom de la maca”, incrementando los precios y provocando la rápida conversión de pastizales altoandinos en tierras de cultivo, transformando de esta manera el paisaje, el ecosistema, la economía y la sociedad rural de la zona altoandina de Junín. Pobladores y actores locales han manifestado su preocupación por la rápida expansión de este cultivo que viene desplazando a la ganadería al pastoreo, principal medio de vida de las familias rurales de la zona. A pesar que las consecuencias generadas por este cambio no han sido estudiadas aun, el cultivo de la maca y su consumo son promovidos por el mercado y el gobierno. El objetivo de este estudio es estimar el cambio de uso de la tierra en zona altoandina de Junín por efecto del boom de la maca, y estimar los posibles impactos de este cambio en los medios de vida de los pobladores y en los ecosistemas altoandinos. Para ello se analizaron imágenes satélites de dos años distintos usando teledetección y se realizaron entrevistas a ganaderos, productores de maca e informantes claves. Del análisis de imágenes de la zona de estudio se observa que en casi 30 años el uso de la tierra cambió aproximadamente en un 30% por efecto de la intensificación agrícola (cultivo de la maca), observándose más áreas de suelo desnudo, tierras en preparación y tierras en recuperación. Esto tiene serias implicancias a nivel de servicios ecosistémicos especialmente por ser área natural de conservación, perturbando no solo la vida silvestre sino también las reservas de carbono en los suelos y la capacidad de retención y filtración de agua. De las entrevistas se comprueba la percepción de los productores de cambio en los medios de vida. De esta manera, se supo que hace 30 años un 98% de los productores se dedicaba solo a ganadería, y ahora solo el 37% se dedica a ganadería y el 63% incluye maca ya sea como sistemas mixtos con ganadería o exclusivamente maca. Otros cambios observados son en el mercado laboral y en el mercado de alquiler de tierras, nunca antes reportado. La caída de los precios de la maca en 2015 puso en duda la sostenibilidad de esta actividad y evidenció los altos riesgos que corre, y los altos costos sociales y ambientales que acarrea. Las políticas de estado que promueven estas actividades para dinamizar la economía local deben considerar las consecuencias ambientales y sociales. La ausencia de políticas o mecanismos de protección de suelos altoandinos, de zonificación y de acciones de mitigación al cambio climático, sigue limitando el desarrollo rural sostenible.";"Turin, C.

"handle:10568/90595";"Land fragmentation, agricultural productivity and implications for agricultural investments in the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) region, Tanzania.";"";"There are polarized evidences of the impact of agricultural land fragmentation on land productivity. On the one hand there viewpoints which consider land fragmentation to harm agricultural productivity. On the other hand there are counter thoughts which view land fragmentation as a positive situation which allows farmers to cultivate many environmental zones, minimise production risk and optimise the schedule for cropping activities. We use the case of Ihemi cluster in the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) to investigate the impact of land fragmentation on crop productivity. We furthermore discuss the nature and causes of land fragmentation in the SAGCOT region and its implication on the future structure of agricultural landholdings and welfare of smallholder farmers in the region. The results showed that the nature and level of fragmentation in the study area were the outcome of combined, rather than isolated influences of supply and demand driven factors. Overall, the
results did not support the claim that fragmentation reduces land productivity. This then implies that land fragmentation should not always be considered as defective. There were evidences of increasing chunks of land owned by rich farmers and investors which increased the possibility for increased consolidation of agricultural land under large scale farming. However, the landholdings for smallholder farmers might become increasingly more fragmented as poor smallholder farmers continue selling their land holdings to rich farmers and investors. Releasing the SAGCOT region’s potential for agricultural development will require that smallholder farmers are helped to secure adequate and suitable land for farming, raise agricultural productivity, diversify their sources of income, and adopt good production practices. This requires setting up a strong base of investor - farmer synergies for inclusive agricultural growth.";"Kadigi, R. M. J.

Extensive flooding of agricultural lands during the rainy season and lack of water during the 8-month long dry season affect the livelihood of the people in the northern Ghana, a situation that calls for better water management practices. The use of aquifer storage and recharge (ASR) based technique, helps to reduce flooding and improve access to water during the dry season; however such technology has specific requirements for successful implementation. This study assesses suitable areas for the technology in the northern Ghana terrain using multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in ArcGIS environment. The result suggests around 66% (48,516 km2) of the crop area in the northern Ghana available for the technology are within moderate to very high suitable sites, of which 44% (29,490 km2) fall into the high and very high suitable sites. This could imply high potential for the artificial groundwater storage system in northern Ghana given other conditions.";"Owusu, Seth

"handle:10568/89162";"The gender gap between water management and water users: evidence from Southwest Bangladesh";"";"Water management in Bangladesh is guided by an intended integrated and inclusive approach enshrined in government legislation since the late 1990s. Based on qualitative and quantitative data collected in the coastal zone, we assess the implementation of these policies with regard to women water uses. First, the analysis of reproductive and productive roles of women establishes that men have a significant role to play in domestic supply, and women use water extensively for small-scale agriculture and aquaculture, the scope of which has been underestimated. However, when considering women's inclusion in community water management and more specifically in Water Management Organizations (WMOs), we demonstrate that women face diverse forms of social barriers resulting in systematic exclusion and self-exclusion from these institutions. Water Management Organizations focus on large-scale productive use of water and are rarely addressing the small scale productive and reproductive uses of water. This creates a gap between water users and water managers, which is exacerbated by class and power relations. The creation of community based water management organisations in the coastal zone of south west Bangladesh has so far not challenged women marginalisation especially in terms of activity limitations and participation restrictions. We conclude by recommending a shift from the inclusiveness policy, which is unable to achieve its goals to a more targeted approach that is relevant in the socio-cultural context of rural Bangladesh.";"Buisson, Marie-Charlotte

We first describe the main legal and policy steps that have shaped this relationship. The article focuses on the Texan portion of the Ogallala Aquifer in the High Plains aquifer system – an almost non-renewable system covering 90,000 km2 and providing 95% of the irrigation needs in northern Texas. With this example, we further highlight the strategies of both parties, the different political, administrative, legal and regulatory complexities of the struggle around the definition of GCD-level aquifer management rules (the so-called 'Desired Future Conditions'). We end by reflecting on the power balance that has resulted from successive adjustments to a co-management form of governance, the advantages and disadvantages of a multi-layered state water governance system, and whether the de facto 'managed depletion' of the Ogallala Aquifer in Texas should be seen as an achievement or a failure.";"Closas, Alvar

"handle:10568/81572";"A hierarchical method for soil erosion assessment and spatial risk modelling: a case study of Kiambu district in Kenya.";"";"Though a lot has been done and achieved in erosion research and control in Kenya, most of the erosion research methods have in the past put emphasis more on quantifying soil loss or measuring soil erosion, rather than pinpointing to areas that are likely to suffer soil erosion. In most cases the erosion processes have been assumed to occur in a uniform manner at all levels of the landscape hierarchy, and hence the results of one level observation can be factored to cover other levels for which data was not collected. This has resulted in many people extrapolating site-specific point data to cover wider geographic regions, assuming uniformity of the erosion process over the region. Another interesting aspect of soil erosion is that though most attention is normally put on the negative effects of soil erosion, soil erosion has also some beneficial effects. For example, the deposition of eroded soil material to lower areas has sometimes improved the quality of the soil receiving the sediment, thereby improving agricultural productivity of the depositional areas. There have however been suggestions that the problem of soil erosion has been exaggerated and not proven to actually diminish crop yields against the background of improved crop productivity improvement techniques. All theses schisms makes it necessary to engage in soil erosion research, either to disprove the sceptics or to provide other means of assessing and viewing the problem of soil erosion.

The general objective of the thesis was to develop and present a method, which can be used to assess the risk of water erosion for different levels of the landscape system hierarchy using spatial methods. The broad aim was to define relevant levels that form the basis for predicting and managing soil erosion and controlling its risk. The specific objectives were:

    To conceptualize and define from the landscape continuum hierarchically ordered landscape elements whose internal characteristics and parts influence the occurrence of soil erosion and whose spatial extent and geometry enable their capture and modelling by remote sensing and GIS.

    To prove that there are spatial features (erosion proxies) which are part-of, and internally contained in the hierarchically defined landscape elements that can aid in soil erosion risk assessment and modelling.

    To demonstrate that the selected erosion proxies can be related to actual occurrences of soil erosion by statistical methods and similarly be differentiated as either drivers or disrupters of erosion.

    To demonstrate that prediction models can be derived from field data collected on the erosion proxies and the developed models used for modelling of soil erosion risk spatially in a GIS for each of the defined levels.

    To test and validate the method in Kiambu.

To address these objectives, concepts associated with hierarchy theory, landscape system construction, geographic information systems theories, and soil erosion theories were knitted together to develop a conceptual framework and a practical methodological approach to effect and realise the objectives.

Kiambu district was selected for testing the developed methodology due to its intensive utilisation for agriculture and its location in a rugged terrain in the upper footridges and footslopes of the Aberdare Mountains where below-canopy soil erosion is obscured by vegetation vigour and intensive cropping. Soil loss studies through river sediment yields in the district, indicate that there are high amounts of soil lost annually by water erosion. These range from 20 t km -2yr -1in undisturbed forests, to 3000 t km -2yr -1in cultivated to grazing lands. Soil loss studies from runoff plots in Kiambu indicate that cultivated land loses between 20 and 30 t ha -1season -1and bare soil loses more that 70 t ha -1season -1. Other justifications were prompted by the fact that soil conservation in Kenya has been focussed to the 'Catchment Approach' without necessarily defining what the catchment means. Perception of soil erosion by farmers was also biased to visible features of erosion such as gullies and tended to ignore the finer features of erosion like rills, interill erosion and other visible forms or erosion.

Recent developments in geographic information systems (GIS) technology have made it possible to model and represent geographical real world phenomena in computerised spatial databases through which they can be stored, analysed, and displayed. GIS can enable stepwise and ordered analysis of the landscape system components as deemed by the landscape researcher. Soil erosion is a product of the interaction of many geographical factors such as: soil surface cover, the erodibility of the soil mantle, the steepness and length of the eroding slope, the erosive energy of falling rain-drops and the specific management aspect of the eroding site. It can therefore be assessed and modelled in a GIS environment as is demonstrated in this thesis.

Concepts

The method integrates concepts, knowledge and implementation procedures. First there is a priori knowledge that is collated in order to facilitate the study of soil erosion in the context of a landscape system. Knowledge and practice are invoked to organise the landscape system into hierarchical levels through which equally ordered erosion processes can be studied, assessed and measured. The conceptual model revolves around the construction of hierarchical levels in a landscape system and how the landscape holons and their parts relate to soil erosion in terms of assessment, prediction and management.

Hierarchical construction of the landscape system allows an ordered organisation of the landscape components into superordinate or subordinate parts which correspond to process time-scales and their corresponding spatial extents. Such an arrangement of the landscape system allows relevant observations and measurements to be made of the ordered processes. The concept deviates from viewing the landscape as an agglomeration of parts in which processes occur presumably in a uniform manner, and where only size changes allowing for smoothing of measured results in a linear generalisation transformation. The method identifies 'individual' landscape elements in each level of the landscape hierarchy in which processes occur within comparable time scales and for which data interchange and modelling can take place. They are termed 'holons' . The holons are used to represent the levels in the hierarchy.

Methodology

The overall methodology comprised several parts involving first the definition of landscape hierarchies, followed by field observations, and then spatial data capture for erosion risk prediction. Statistical analysis and spatial modelling of erosion risk in a GIS followed the first three steps. The first step mainly concentrated on defining the landscape hierarchies that could be used for assessing soil erosion risk spatially in a GIS. Landscape elements were identified to represent each level in the landscape hierarchy. These included the field-plot, the watershed and the landscape unit. The field observation part involved the collection of soil erosion data in a stratified and randomised strategy where 164 samples were collected for the field-plot holon types, 89 for the watershed holon types, and 104 samples for the landscape holon types. Maps were prepared for each of the levels before field data collection and data points plotted on them for field reference. Collecting soil erosion data involved measuring depths of erosion features formed by either water or gravity as agents of erosion. The erosion features included soil movement, translocated surface litter, visible flow channels, depth of stem washing, depth of root exposure, rills, gullies, and mass soil movement. Only the encountered erosion features on each proxy were observed and measured. Where there was no erosion, zero values were recorded. For prediction modelling, independent spatial data sets were prepared for the three spatial landscape holon types and their internally contained erosion proxies. Aerial photographs were used to capture the field-plot and watershed holon types while satellite images were used to capture the landscape level holon types. This was done in the spatial data capture part of the methodology. Statistical analysis involved confirming that the selected spatial erosion proxies influenced the occurrence of soil erosion, first by the occurrence of erosion features in the proxies and secondly by differentiating the contribution of each proxy to the overall erosion using the analysis of variance and the mean occurrence. The spatial modelling part of the methodology involved the production of logistic and logit regression prediction models from the initial random data, which were used to manipulate the newly created spatial data sets to produce erosion risk domains based on pre-defined erosion indicators, herein defined as erosion proxies for each of the levels. Properties of the proxies such as their slope-gradient, percentage ground cover and soil erodibility were used as the predictor variables after being tested for suitability as prediction variables by correlation analysis.

Results

It was possible to use large-scale aerial photographs to capture field-plot and watershed level erosion proxies. Their real-world positions in the broader landscape were located using a global positioning system, commonly known as a GPS. The extracted holon types representing each level and their erosion proxies captured from the aerial photographs and satellite images were digitised and stored in a geographic information system. Field plots with their lands use kinds represented the lowest level of the hierarchy. Linear features in the watershed such as field-plot boundaries, footpaths, hedges, fences, tree lines, stonewalls, forest edges, wash-stops in tea and closed field boundaries represented the second level of the hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchical construction, the landscape unit had river valleys, roads, and built-up centres representing the highest level erosion proxies. All the levels of the landscape hierarchy represented by different holon types, i.e. field-plots, watersheds, and the landscape units were stored as area objects while the erosion proxies inside them were stored as either area objects or as line objects. The field-plots were stored as area objects while the linear watershed proxies were stored as line objects. The landscape level erosion proxies that included built-up areas, river valleys, and road networks were stored as either linear objects or as area objects.

From the descriptive statistics and analysis of variance it was possible to differentiate between the proxies that acted as the drivers of erosion as earlier postulated and those that acted as disrupters of erosion. The selected proxies for each of the levels and the frequency of their occurrences in each holon type supported the hierarchy theory of new and emergent erosion indicators for the different levels of the hierarchical organisation of the landscape system. Some proxies could be selected to act as the erosion indicators for each of the levels. Soil movement, rills, washed stems, exposed roots, flow channels and translocated surface litter occurred in all the field-plot level erosion proxies. Gullies emerged as new erosion features for the proxies of the watershed level while soil movement, rills, stem wash and root exposures occurred in one third of the watershed level erosion proxy types. Mass soil movement emerged as new erosion features for the landscape level proxies while rills dominated and occurred in all the proxies. Soil movement and gullies occurred in two-thirds of the landscape level erosion proxies.

Important outputs from the prediction models were the odds ratios that provided quantitative values of how the erosion proxy properties influenced the risk of erosion. For the field-plot level holon types, a unit percent increase in slope created an increase in the risk of occurrence of soil erosion by 24% while a unit percentage increase in cover reduced the risk of occurrence by 8%. Slope added to the risk while cover reduced the risk. The risk contributed to by slope assumes constant cover and similarly the reduction in the occurrence of risk assumes constant slopes. For the watershed level holons, slope enhanced the risk of erosion by 36%. For the landscape level holons, a unit increase in percent slope enhanced the risk by 229%. A unit increase in cover percentage reduced the risk by 5% when the slope is constant. These figures obtained by the odds ratio show the erosion hazard conditioned by each of the proxy types. Slope and cover of the different multi-level erosion proxies proved to be important variables for predicting the hierarchical risk of erosion in the landscape system.

The spatial data on predicted erosion risk provided useful information for erosion risk management. The spatial extent attribute made it possible to determine the amount of time and energy required for tackling the risk associated with any proxy. The object position helped in precisely targeting intervention measures, while the distribution showed the relative intensity of the risk in any given area and the proximity of the risk to known locations of the geographic feature space. The independently produced logistic and logit prediction models produced spatial patterns that corresponded very well with the predictor variables of slope and cover of the proxies. This obtained relationship gave credence to the predictive power of the models. The logistic regression models showed the probabilities of erosion risk in the proxies, while the logit models refined the risk zones due to the transformation of the probabilities to a longer linear stretch. The logit models therefore provided a broader spectrum of the predictions making it possible to distinguish areas with low risk from areas with very high risks of erosion that required immediate and prioritised attention.

Strengths of the methodology and conceptual model

The methodology seeks to establish a means by which soil erosion can be assessed and modelled at multiple levels in a landscape. It deviates from other single-level erosion assessment and risk prediction methods that are of common practice in Kenya and in many other parts of the world. It views the landscape as a medium in which water erosion processes are taking place in an intricate manner at different spatial hierarchies and which are also the entities for land use and erosion management. These spatial attributes offer the opportunity to predict and view the distribution of the risk of erosion on the broader landscape and at different attention levels. These create management opportunities are powerful tools for preventing or controlling soil erosion. The beneficiaries of the methodology outputs are seen as farmers, government departments, and other non-governmental organisations that are involved in soil and water management.

Weaknesses of the conceptual model

The following were the observed weaknesses during implementation:

    In intensive annual farming systems, the features of erosion are usually obscured by frequent tillage practices making their assessment only possible immediately after tillage and after the event of an eroding rainfall or during minimum tillage periods;

    The above reason means that temporal considerations must be embedded in the methodology where the observations in the field are timed to coincide with rainfall and field preparations; and

    Any organisations opting to use the method must be fully equipped with GIS facilities and technical capacity to manipulate the spatial databases and modelling their attributes. Technical capacity is also required in the fields of soil erosion assessment and statistical analysis. Remote sensing knowledge and data offer the best opportunities for capturing landscape objects for integration into a GIS. Acquisition of the data and capacity to manipulate the images both digitally and manually are unavoidable requirements of the methodology.

Overarching discussions and conclusions

After collecting data on soil erosion and analysing it statistically, it has been shown that soil erosion in the field plot holon, watershed holon and landscape holon can be distinguished according to different erosion proxies for each of the holons. This finding can be used to refine the erosion prediction models such that the erosion processes are linked to the landscape holons with which they are closely associated. Scientific observations and measurements can also be ordered according to the holon type such that any extrapolations are directed to equal levels within the structure of the hierarchy. Different holons represent different levels of the landscape hierarchy.

Due to the techniques of assessing soil erosion in the field as applied in this work, it was possible to show that soil erosion goes on even in tea plantations, coffee plantations and in forests. If erosion assessment is only based on farm fields, then the erosion in the in higher level holons such as watershed or the landscape unit will be masked somewhere during erosion impact evaluations. This thesis has also enhanced the recognition of soil erosion by using visible features to capture and measure incidences of past erosion. Soil movement, flow channels, translocated surface litter, are features of erosion, which are not usually discussed nor used for either assessing or quantifying soil erosion. Their use can now be integrated into further works. With the presented methodology of assessing soil erosion, more data will be generated and demonstrated to the farmers and other interested people on soil erosion and its hazard. The presented assessment and definitions in this work have also removed the problem of terminology especially in the definition of the landscape features for studying and managing soil erosion. The watershed has presented itself as the best management unit for many members of a community and can be adopted by any organisation concerned with collective management of soil erosion. The field plot remains the preserve of a single farmer while the landscape unit requires more of state interventions and deliberate management policy.

Prediction modelling made it possible to assign a quantitative value to the risk of erosion. The landscape unit had the highest risk (229%), followed by the watershed (36%) and the field plot (24%). Resources and efforts must therefore be availed and directed towards addressing soil erosion risk occasioned by the landscape level erosion processes and proxies. Managing the landscape level alone will not have a net benefit if the two other levels are not also attended to since they equally suffer soil erosion risk. A holistic management approach will provide a more effective management approach to the soil erosion risk. Government priorities can be directed at the landscape level. Intermediate agencies such as Community Based Groups and organisations can tackle the watershed level risk while farmers and farming communities can tackle the field-plot and watershed levels.

Researchable areas include in depth social studies that link biophysical spatial properties of the landscape to the socio-economic and policy instruments for each of the levels of the landscape hierarchy, i.e., field-plots, watershed units and the landscape units. Others are studies that link these landscape system holons with soil erosion proxies and soil erosion processes especially on their relationships with sediment yields, etc. to confirm further the notion of landscape hierarchies and erosion process resolutions. Finally, calibration and further testing of the prediction models in other parts of Kenya are recommended.";"Okoth, Peter F.";"Wageningen University & Research";"Wageningen University";"CGIAR";"2003-12-31";"en";"water management;land";"";"002;ETH;014";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/81572";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"83977"

El presente estudio tuvo por finalidad evaluar la distribución espacial de la biodiversidad de papa mediante el mapeo participativo. Se determinaron las áreas de siembra de papa, el número de variedades de papa existente en la comunidad, el rango altitudinal de siembra por categoría varietal, la frecuencia de las variedades de papa, y la dinámica espacial-temporal de las zonas de siembra de papa en el territorio de las comunidades campesinas. Se encontraron 158 variedades en Challabamba y 194 variedades Quilcas. El área dedicada a las papas nativas fue mayor en Challabamba (71.5%) que en Quilcas (51.8%) en comparación con las papas mejoradas. En Challabamba, el 89.9 % de las variedades encontradas son papas nativas y el 10.1% son papas mejoradas. En Quilcas, el 91.2 % de las variedades encontradas son papas nativas y el 8.8% son papas mejoradas. La mitad de las variedades de papas nativas se encuentran localizados en una franja altitudinal de siembra menor a 200 m.

La frecuencia relativa de las variedades muestra que el 21.8% y 16.3% de las variedades son consideradas abundantes en Challabamba y Quilcas respectivamente, y el resto (78.2% y 83.7) son variedades clasificadas como escasas. Finalmente, se encontró que el periodo de descanso de las parcelas es en promedio de 6 años antes de volver a sembrar papa.";"Plasencia, Franklin

Study focus: Review of work on TBAs in Africa, including an overview of assessments and management efforts that have taken place over the last half century.
New hydrological insights : Seventy-two TBAs have been mapped in Africa. They underlie 40% of the continent, where 33% of the population lives, often in arid or semi-arid regions. TBA inventories have progressed since 2000 and remain work in progress. Despite their importance only eleven TBAs have been subjected to more detailed studies. Cooperation has been formalised for seven TBAs. Most of these TBAs are in North Africa and the Sahel. The recent global Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme compiled information at the national level to describe TBAs in terms of key indicators related to the water resource, socio-economic, and legal and institutional conditions. Availability of data at national level is low, hampering regional assessment. Comparing indicators, from questionnaire surveys, with those from a global water-use model showed variable levels of agreement, calling for further research. Reports on agreements scoping TBA management, indicate that this may be dealt with within international river/lake agreements, but reported inconsistencies between TBA sharing countries also indicate that implementation is limited. Increasing awareness and support to joint TBA management is noticeable amongst international organisations. However, such cooperation requires long-term commitment to produce impacts at the local level.";"Nijstena, G-J.

CIFOR’s research shows that a sustainable supply of timber may be achievable through partnership schemes that encourage companies and local communities to work together in sharing both the benefits and risks of investing in plantations. Despite recent private sector support for partnership schemes, there is evidence to suggest companies often do not have a clear idea of the measures needed to ensure tree growers’ full commitment. In the short-term, companies would not gain economic benefits from the amount of wood produced under partnerships, but more by sharing the risks and benefits with local communities in establishing timber plantations. However, the challenges are complex and the long term viability of partnerships depends on ensuring the partnership can deal with to the changing condition.";"Nawir, A.A.

In this assessment, land degradation is referred to as the persistent loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused by disturbances from which the land cannot recover without human intervention (unaided). Hotspots are defined as places that experience high land degradation and if left unattended, will negatively affect both human wellbeing and the environment. The spatial location of hotspots was identified through a methodology combining modeling, participatory stakeholder consultations and field validation. Understanding the spatial locations helps identify hotspot areas and target them as priority intervention sites with relevant management options.

"handle:10568/81584";"Human and animal health in nomadic pastoralist communities of Chad: Zoonosis, morbidity and health services";"";"The health of nomadic pastoralists is influenced by factors specific to their way of life.
Nomadic pastoralists depend on their livestock for subsistence, especially on the livestock’s
milk. Veterinary services provide vaccination against feared livestock diseases such as
anthrax. Agents transmissible between livestock and humans (zoonotic agents) may have an
important impact on the health status of pastoralists because they live in close contact to their
animals. However, morbidity of nomadic pastoralists in Chad had not been documented and
their everyday use of health services was virtually unknown. A research collaboration
between veterinary and public health was implemented to evaluate morbidity of nomadic
pastoralists and of their animals simultaneously and to test intersectoral pilot-interventions
following the concept of “one medicine”. The studies encompassed in this thesis were
conducted in the framework of an interdisciplinary research and action programme. Fulani and Arab cattle breeders and Arab camel breeders were visited during three
consecutive samplings, two in the dry season and one in the wet season, between April 1999
and April 2000. A physician clinically examined 1160 women, men and children and
completed a survey questionnaire. Sera, sputum and urine samples were collected from
humans, as well as sera and milk from 1640 animals. Complementary interviews mainly
directed at livestock health were recorded. Brucellosis and Q-fever were selected to investigate a possible correlation between the
occurrence of these zoonoses in livestock and in humans. No active foci of brucellosis were
found. The impact of brucellosis and Q-fever on the health status of the three nomadic
communities included in the study appeared marginal in comparison to other diseases
recorded. Pulmonary diseases were frequent, e.g. bronchitis in children under 5 years of age
(18%). Arab cattle and camel breeders were severely diseased by malaria during the wet
season. Clinically diagnosed malaria was prevalent during the entire year among Fulani, who
stayed in the vicinity of Lake Chad. Human serum retinol concentrations were significantly
correlated to livestock milk retinol, illustrating the significance of milk as a dietary
component. However, serum retinol levels of women were generally low. A 24-hours dietary
recall showed that nomadic pastoralists only rarely consumed fruits and vegetables. The utilisation study provided an overview on health service utilisation patterns of sick
nomadic pastoralists. Participants with respiratory disorders went early to a dispensary for
consultation and successively also used more other health services. Dispensaries where antimalarial
drugs were known to be in short supply were rarely visited during the wet season.
Our data suggest that young unmarried women and men had fewer opportunities to visit a
marabout or a dispensary than other members of the community. Women gave birth assisted
by relatives in the camps, and prenatal health care was virtually not used. No fully immunised
nomadic child was found in the study population. In contrast, livestock had been vaccinated
by veterinarians visiting the nomadic camps during compulsory vaccination campaigns.
Breeders observed an increasing inefficacy of anthrax, blackleg and pasteurellosis vaccines.
Deaths of cattle after vaccination against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and visits of
veterinarians solely to take blood for rinderpest serosurveillance without treating diseased
animals were recurrent complaints of nomadic pastoralists towards veterinary services.
Nevertheless, the idea of joint human and animal vaccination campaigns was appreciated
because nomadic pastoralists wanted vaccination for their children, especially against
measles. To which extent knowledge and experiences with livestock vaccination were
transposed to children vaccination remained unclear. A cost analysis of subsequent joint
vaccination campaigns showed that the public health sector can save up to 15% of
infrastructure and personnel costs when vaccination services for nomadic children and women
are delivered together with interventions of the livestock production sector. Improvement of the quality of dispensary services has a potential to increase the utilisation of
dispensaries by nomadic people. Health workers belonging to the nomadic community itself
and better able to reach the camps may, nevertheless, be more accessible to women and
children. Static or outreach dispensary-based vaccination services do not have the same
efficiency to reach nomadic children as mobile vaccination campaigns have. Private
veterinarians, who almost exclusively have access to pastoralists in remote areas would be
interested in more fully capitalising their transportation infrastructure. Joint human and
animal vaccination campaigns should be extended to other services (such as the selling of
drugs) and especially to information campaigns. The provision of appropriate information
may be as important as health care interventions themselves.";"Schelling, E.";"University of Basel";"University of Basel";"CGIAR";"2002-12-31";"en";"pastoral lands;pastoralists";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"002;TCD;017";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/81584";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"83989"
"handle:10568/81583";"Evaluation of anthelmintic properties of ethnoveterinary plant preparations used as livestock dewormers by pastoralists and small holder farmers in Kenya";"";"Parasitic  nematodes,  especially  
Haemonchus  contortus,
  are  among  the  most  common  and  
economically  important  causes  of  infectious
  diseases  of  sheep  and  goats  owned  by  
pastoralists  and  small  holder  farm
ers  in  East  Africa.  In  Kenya,  control  of  these  infections  
mainly relies on the use of anthelmintic dr
ugs. However, ethnoveteri
nary medicine (EVM) 
preparations  are  widely  used  by  pastoralists
  and  small  holder  farmers  (SHF)  for  treatment  
of their livestock agains
t helminth parasites.  
This thesis covers the evaluation of the anth
elmintic efficacy of some EVM preparations 
used by pastoralists and SHF in Kenya. The plant species selected, and prepared for animal 
dosing  with  the  help  of  traditional  healers  (THs)  were:  
Aframomum  sanguineum,  Albizia  
anthelmintica,   Ananas   comosus,   Annona   s
quamosa,   Azadirachta   indica,   Dodonaea   
angustifolia,   Hagenia   abyssinica,   Hildebrandtia
   sepalosa,   Myrsine
   africana,   Olea   
europaea
 var. 
africana
, and 
Rapanea melanophloeos
. Evaluation was carried out in two 
in 
vivo
  infection  models,  namely  
H.  contortus
  in  sheep  and  
Heligmosomoides  polygyrus
  in  
mice. The anthelmintic efficacy of the EVM 
preparations was monitored through faecal egg 
count  (FEC)  reduction,  at  regular  intervals  fo
r  a  period  of  2  –  3  weeks  post  treatment  in  
sheep. Monitoring in mice was done through FE
C and total worm counts (TWC) one week 
after  treatment.  An  
a  priori  
cut-off  value  of  70%  reduction  of  FEC  and  TWC,  to  denote  
useful anthelmintic efficacy, was used for both sheep and mice. 
Of  the  ten  plant  species  tested  in  sheep,  the  largest  decrease  of  34%  in  FEC  was  
measured from a bark preparation of 
A. anthelmintica
 collected from the Samburu District. 
None of the other plant species had a significant effect on FEC. 
Similarly, the seven plant species and some 
of their related active constituents evaluated 
in   mice   did   not   significantly   reduce   FEC   or
   remove   parasites.   Preparations   of   
A. 
anthelmintica
 at doses above 0.5 g per mouse were toxic. 
In  conclusion,  no  reduction  of  FEC  or  TWC  greater  than  the  
a priori
 value of 70% was 
observed   in   sheep   or   in   mice.   Therefore,   
the   plants   evaluated   were   ineffective   as   
anthelmintics in the preparations and forms that were used.

Based on a combination of Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, previous irrigated area mapping exercises carried out by DAFF and three-field ground truthing (GT) surveys, a total of 1.6 million hectares (Mha) of cropland were identified, with 262,000 ha actually irrigated in the 2015 winter season. The study also found that only 29% of all land equipped with center pivots was actually irrigated.";"Xueliang Cai

Recently, individual irrigation technologies such as small motorized pumps, drip kits, treadle pumps, rope and washer pumpsarebeing promoted.Adoption ofthesetechnologiesandexpansion ofsmallholder irrigationhoweverface a number of challenges including land tenure issues; lack of access to appropriate irrigation technologies, improved agricultural inputs, reliable markets,  nance and credit services, and research support; poor transport and communication infrastructures; poor irrigation water management; poor extension systems; and the over dependence on national governments, NGOs and donors for support. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist for smallholder irrigation expansion in East Africa.

"handle:10568/91210";"Carrying water may be a major contributor to disability from musculoskeletal disorders in low income countries: a cross-sectional survey in South Africa, Ghana and Vietnam";"";"Background
The Sustainable Development Goals include commitments to end poverty, and promote education for all, gender equality, the availability of water and decent work for all. An important constraint is the fact that each day, many millions of women and children, and much less frequently men, carry their household’s water home from off-plot sources. The burden of fetching water exacerbates gender inequality by keeping women out of education and paid employment. Despite speculation about the potential health impacts of fetching water, there is very little empirical evidence. We report the first large study of the health impacts of carrying water on women and children.

Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in South Africa, Ghana and Vietnam during 2012. It investigated water carrying methods and health status. Because areas of self-reported pain were correlated we undertook factor analysis of sites of reported pain, to interpret patterns of pain reporting. Regression analysis using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) investigated water carrying as a risk factor for general health and self-reported pain.

Results
People who previously carried water had increased relative risk of reporting pain in the hands (risk ratio RR 3.62, 95% confidence interval CI 1.34 to 9.75) and upper back (RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.40), as did people who currently carry water (RR hand pain 3.11, 95% CI 1.34 to 7.23; RR upper back pain 2.16, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.73). The factor analysis results indicate that factor 1, ‘axial compression’, which is correlated with pain in the head and upper back, chest/ribs, hands, feet and abdomen/stomach, is associated with currently (0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.43) or previously (0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.42) carrying water. Factor 2, ‘soft tissue strain’, which is correlated with pain in the neck, shoulders/arms, lower back and hips/pelvis or legs, is marginally negatively associated with currently (-0.18, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.04) carrying water. The factor ‘axial compression’ was more strongly associated with carrying water containers on the head.

Conclusions
Participants who reported a history of current or past water carrying more frequently reported pain in locations most likely to be associated with sustained spinal axial compression in the cervical region. Given the fact that cervical spinal conditions are globally one of the more common causes of disability, our findings suggest that water carrying, especially by head loading is a major contributing factor in musculoskeletal disease burden in low income countries. Our findings support the proposed indicator for monitoring SDG6.1: “Percentage of population using safely managed drinking water services at home.”";"Geere, J.

"handle:10568/81560";"Transcending landscapes: Working across scales and levels in pastoralist rangeland governance";"";"Landscape approaches can be subjected to mistakenly targeting a single “best” level of governance, and paying too little attention to the role that cross-scale and cross-level interactions play in governance. In rangeland settings, resources, patterns of use of those resources, and the institutions for managing the resources exist at multiple levels and scales. While the scholarship on commons offers some guidance on how to conceptualize governance in rangeland landscapes, some elements of commons scholarship—notably the “design principles” for effective governance of commons—do not seem to apply neatly to governance in pastoralist rangeland settings. This paper examines three cases where attempts have been made to foster effective landscape governance in such settings to consider how the materiality of commons influences the nature of cross-scale and cross-level interactions, and how these interactions affect governance. In all three cases, although external actors seemed to work appropriately and effectively at community and landscape levels, landscape governance mechanisms have been facing great challenges arising from relationships beyond the landscape, both vertically to higher levels of decision-making and horizontally to communities normally residing in other landscapes. The cases demonstrate that fostering effective landscape-level governance cannot be accomplished only through action at the landscape level; it is a task that must be pursued at multiple levels and in relation to the connections across scales and levels. The paper suggests elements of a conceptual framework for understanding cross-level and cross-scale elements of landscape governance, and offers suggestions for governance design in pastoralist rangeland settings.";"Robinson, Lance W.

The need to optimise nitrogen (N) use for nutrition security while minimising environmental risks in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is overdue. Challenges related to managing N use in SSA can be associated with both insufficient use and excessive loss, and thus the continent must address the ‘too little’ and ‘too much’ paradox. Too little N is used in food production (80% of countries have N deficiencies), which has led to chronic food insecurity and malnutrition. Conversely, too much N load in water bodies due mainly to soil erosion, leaching, limited N recovery from wastewater, and atmospheric deposition contributes to eutrophication (152 Gg N year–1 in Lake Victoria, East Africa). Limited research has been conducted to improve N use for food production and adoption remains low, mainly because farming is generally practiced by resource-poor smallholder farmers. In addition, little has been done to effectively address the ‘too much’ issues, as a consequence of limited research capacity. This research gap must be addressed, and supportive policies operationalised, to maximise N benefits, while also minimising pollution. Innovation platforms involving key stakeholders are required to address N use efficiency along the food supply chain in SSA, as well as other world regions with similar challenges.";"Masso, C.

So as to understand the dynamics of territorialization, we ground our analysis in the proximity framework to highlight that social and spatial relations around water resources are unbalanced. How this spatial inequality is taken into account may favor, or on the contrary, harm the sustainability of coordination. The approach in terms of proximity allows us to account for the complex articulation between the processes of territorial construction and the subsidiarity and participation principles presented as gage of IWRM success.";"Torou, Bio Mohamadou

Establishing both restoration and sustainable rangeland management practices are crucial to reverse the negative impacts on the ecosystem. However, a primary estimate of the native baseline’s water and sediment fluxes is essential to properly target a sustainable transition from degraded to a potentially revegetated landscape status. In Jordan, a widely applied restoration technique is the mechanized micro-Water Harvesting basin (WH) approach on sloping, degraded, and hard-crusted rangelands. Small basins (6m long by 0.6 cm deep) are scooped out of the soil along the contour with the spoils piled on the down slope side of the basin. Within the micro-pit basins native shrubs are planted supporting the development of shrub islands. This technique captures overland flow and reduces soil erosion. The Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) was used to explore three different rangeland ecological states and their implications on water and soil fluxes: i) the supposed historical vegetation condition (baseline), using literature review and scientist and community questionnaire data, ii) the actual degraded status, and iii) micro-WH based restored equilibrium scenario, based on field monitoring and modeling. Rangeland experimental site near Amman, Jordan, provided diverse monitoring and validation data for RHEM modeling. RHEM was applied to evaluate 1) long-term stability of the 3 different ecological states of the hillslopes (i-iii), and 2) event based spatially distributed watershed modeling to estimate how the different scenarios of landscape vegetation patterns would alter hydrologic processes. The spatial-temporal assessment of water and sediment transport in baseline, degraded, and restored Jordanian rangelands provide information on the sustainability of the WH restoration approach to different rainfall events (i.e., 10 year runoff event) and allow us to approximate resilient equilibrium water and soil dynamics that is available to support the restored vegetation.";"Haddad, Mira

The technology, which includes sensors, processing software and analysis, has been extensively studied and applied. Studies that employed remote sensing have improved understanding of the sites studied. At the strategic level of forest planning, or in general planning for forest resource allocation over a wide area, remote sensing can play an important role in estimating and monitoring forest cover. At the tactical level, however, when planning forest management activities in a specific forested landscape, remote sensing has not yet contributed as much as expected: Methods proved successful under research conditions cannot always be applied to operational management. There is a gap between scientific and operational uses. Recognising this gap, forest management practitioners and scientists gathered for a daylong focus group discussion to examine constraints and understand better what practitioners expected remote sensing to do for them. The following recommendations arose from the group discussions.";"Takao, G.

A new study conducted by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Pegasys Institute, with support from the UK government, traces the origins of these systems, and describes their implementation and consequences for rural smallholders in five countries – Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The authors of this report propose a hybrid water use rights system to decolonize Africa’s water law, lighten the administrative burden on the state and make legal access to water more equitable. This would strengthen smallholder irrigation, which is vital for boosting Africa’s food production and making it more resilient in the face of worsening drought.";"van Koppen, Barbara

"handle:10568/97200";"Simultaneous adoption of integrated soil fertility management technologies in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa";"";"Empirical scientific evidence indicates that there is still room for increasing food production by improving land productivity. This study aimed at identifying the key determinants that govern farmers’ decisions to adopt multiple components of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) in a maize mixed cropping system of the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. Revealed preferences of ISFM components were collected from 320 randomly selected households and multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyse the simultaneous effects on adoption based on biophysical plot and household‐level socioeconomic attributes. The results show that farmers’ choices of a set of ISFM components are determined by a mix of factors that address the trade‐offs and synergies among them. Non‐farm income, moderate land quality perception, and education influence simultaneous technology adoption, while gender and crop loss increase the likelihood of farmers’ decisions to adopt independent options. Having other sources of income supports co‐adoption of inorganic fertilizer, residue incorporation, and crop rotation. Input/output market access, access to information, financial sources, and climate variability also play pivotal role in technology adoption. These results indicate that resource availability, learning costs, finances, and risk aversion need to be considered when designing and promoting ISFM technologies as a package.";"Mponela, Powell

"handle:10568/97204";"Highlights of soil and water conservation investments in four regions of Ethiopia";"";"This paper provides details of soil and water conservation (SWC) investments in Ethiopia over the past 20 years. It presents SWC practices and estimates the level of SWC investments in different regions. The paper focuses on four principal agricultural regions: Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR and Tigray. Primary and secondary data were collected for the analysis, and consultations were conducted at regional levels. Primary data on diverse SWC practices, their numbers and areal extent were obtained from the archives of regional Bureaus of Agriculture (BoAs). The results of this study show that several projects involving significant financial investment have been implemented to reverse land degradation and improve land productivity in Ethiopia since the 1970s. The list of projects is not comprehensive due to a lack of documentation at all levels, but it does provide some insights into the scale of SWC investments and implementation. The projects analyzed in the four regions fall into the following categories: farmland management, hillside management and gully rehabilitation practices, including check dams and cut-off drains. The analysis shows that these practices involved both paid and unpaid labor, together representing an estimated investment of more than ETB 25 billion (or approximately USD 1.2 billion) per year over the past 10 years. It is clear that large investments have been made in SWC activities in Ethiopia. However, the outcomes in terms of impact on yield and livelihood benefits are yet to be fully understood. A comprehensive assessment is needed to measure the impact of SWC activities on farmers’ livelihoods and the environment. A key recommendation arising from the analysis is that more data and information are needed on the successes and failures of SWC practices, which will assist stakeholders to better guide and target future projects and investments. An additional recommendation is to consider the biophysical and financial impact of soil erosion, both on and off farm.";"Adimassu, Zenebe

"handle:10568/81009";"Awareness and adoption of land,soil and water conservation practices in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa";"";"The promotion of land, soil and water conservation measures has been a widespread development in sub-Saharan Africa in a bid to tackle degradation and improve productivity. As a result, several governments have launched various campaigns on soil, land and water conservation measures. The aim of this study is to determine some of the factors that influence farmers’ awareness (knowledge) and adoption of land, soil and water conservation practices. Data for this study was collected from 312 households using a questionnaire survey in the Chinyanja Triangle of Southern Africa. The study sites were sampled from Tete province of Mozambique, central and southern regions of Malawi and eastern Province of Zambia. We used t-tests to classify adopters and non-adopters of soil, land and water conservation measures and binomial logit models to identify the factors that influence farmers’ knowledge of conservation measures and adoption of land productivity practices. The results show that the household head's age, education, agricultural advice reception and farmer group membership are critical in raising awareness. While the household head's age, education, agricultural advice reception, farmer group membership, pieces of land owned or used in production and land-to-man ratio influenced adoption decisions. The study, therefore, concludes that in order to improve land productivity in the Chinyanja Triangle, there is a need to consider farmers’ heterogeneity in terms of household head's age, level of education, extension services outreach, and socio-economic characteristics. This suggests that governments’ policies in the region should be aimed at improving farmers’ level of education, extension delivery that will target the elderly and the youth, land ownership, credit access, and social capital such as group formation.";"Mango, Nelson

It aims to achieve food security and broader development goals under a changing climate and increasing food demand.

CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance resilience, and reduce/remove greenhouse gases (GHGs), and require planning to address tradeoffs and synergies between these three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and mitigation [1]. The priorities of different countries and stakeholders are reflected to achieve more efficient, effective, and equitable food systems that address challenges in environmental, social, and economic dimensions across productive landscapes.

While the concept is new, and still evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA already exist worldwide and are used by farmers to cope with various production risks. Mainstreaming CSA requires critical stocktaking of ongoing and promising practices for the future, and of institutional and financial enablers for CSA adoption.

This country profile provides a snapshot of a developing baseline created to initiate discussion, both within countries and globally, about entry points for investing in CSA at scale.";"Zavariz-Romero, Beatriz

It describes the origins of the concept and the methodological developments, its operationalization through applied research, and some lessons learned over the two decades of research. This report further highlights how a focus on agricultural water productivity has brought greater attention to critical water scarcity issues, and the role of agricultural water management in supporting broader development objectives such as increasing agricultural production, reducing agricultural water use, raising farm-level incomes, and alleviating poverty and inequity. Yet, reliance on a single-factor productivity metric, such as agricultural water productivity defined as “crop per drop,” in multi-factor and multi-output production processes can mask the complexity of agricultural systems as well as the trade-offs required to achieve desired outcomes. The findings from this retrospective underscore the limitations of single-factor productivity metrics while also highlighting opportunities to support more comprehensive approaches to address water scarcity concerns and, ultimately, achieve the broader development objectives.";"Giordano, Meredith A.

Twelve levels of NPK (0-0- 0; 0-100-100; 50-100-100; 100-100-100; 200-100-100; 100-0-100; 100- 50-100; 100-200-100; 100-100-0; 100-100-50; 100-100-200; 200-200- 200) were applied. Partial budgeting was used for the economic analysis. The highest income was reached with M Col 113 in the 100- 100-200 treatment and the lowest income with CMC 92 in the check treatment. Tables and diagrams with the variable costs and clear profits corresponding to each treatment are given. (CIAT)||En mayo de 1980 en la seccion de suelos del programa de yuca del CIAT se establecio un ensayo de fertilizacion con 3 var. de yuca (Barranquena (regional), M Col 113 y CMC 92) para medir su efecto en el rendimiento y establecer los niveles optimos desde el punto de vista economico. El ensayo se localizo en Mondomito y Agua Blanca del municipio de Santander de Quilichao, Cauca (Colombia). Se aplicaron 12 niveles de NPK (0-0-0; 0-100-100; 50-100-100; 100- 100-100; 200-100-100; 100-0-100; 100-50-100; 100-200-100; 100-100- 0; 100-100-50; 100-100-200; 200-200-200). Para el analisis economico se empleo el metodo del presupuesto parcial. El mayor ingreso se logro con la var. M Col 113 en el tratamiento 100-100- 200 y el menor ingreso con CMC 92 en el tratamiento testigo. Se incluyen cuadros y graficas con los costos variables y los beneficios netos correspondientes a cada tratamiento. (CIAT)";"Diaz, R.O.

"handle:10568/91541";"Effects of land use on catchment runoff and soil loss in the sub-humid Ethiopian highlands";"";"Land use and management affects runoff and soil loss from a catchment. The present study investigated the effects of land use on runoff and suspended sediment concentration and yield in the northwestern Ethiopia. We selected two small catchments: cultivated land and grassland dominated catchments within the 95 ha Debre Mawi catchment. Hydrometric and sediment concentration data were collected for five years (i.e., 2010–2014). Significant (p < 0.05) differences in daily, monthly and annual runoff, as well as suspended sediment concentrations were observed between cultivated land and grassland dominated catchments. The greater runoff, suspended sediment concentration and yield in the cultivated catchment could be attributed to repeated tillage and low soil organic matter. Repeated tillage in the cultivated land lead to soil disturbance and the low organic matter lead to aggregate instability, both of which consequently increase the detachment of soil particles and transport by generated runoff. Our results support that land management practices that involve lower soil disturbance and increase ground cover on degraded highland areas such as the Ethiopian highlands could help reduce runoff and soil loss.";"Dagnew, D.

"handle:10568/92345";"Operationalizing payments for ecosystem services for pastoralists in rangeland settings";"";"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are gaining popularity as an environmental and development policy tool. Spurred by environmental motives, different financial and non-financial incentive schemes are designed to create positive social and environmental impact. Although the experience of PES implementation is relatively significant in the agricultural, forestry and to a certain degree marine sector, the application of PES for pastoralists in rangeland settings is limited. Furthermore, there is very little focus in the existing literature on the challenges of operationalizing PES for pastoralists. This study aims to jump from the theory of PES implementation to practice by examining the trade-offs, barriers and opportunities that can be expected when operationalizing PES schemes for pastoralists in rangeland settings. The study follows a framework that encompasses the complexities of pastoral systems—the political, legal, institutional, social, environmental and financial aspects that determine PES scheme design—and allows a critical examination of these factors. While PES schemes may offer an opportunity to bridge pastoral livelihood systems with sustainable rangeland ecosystem service provision, the variability of its impact as an effective tool calls for scrupulous context-specific assessments. An outcome of this study has been a preliminary scoping protocol, designed to guide practitioners to comprehensively unearth and evaluate the risks and opportunities of operationalizing PES schemes in different pastoral contexts. This study is particularly interesting for practitioners as it views PES implementation from a practical angle and offers resources, case-study examples, tools and complementary solutions to help overcome some of the PES implementation challenges.";"Pappagallo, L.";"";"International Livestock Research Institute";"CGIAR";"2018-04-15";"en";"pastoral lands;rangelands;pastoralists";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/92345";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"95608"

"handle:10568/21021";"Analysis of China’s overseas investment policies";"";"In recent years, in line with China’s Going Out strategy announced in 2000, China’s overseas investment activities have increased greatly and at increasing rates. By the end of 2009, the total value of China’s outward foreign direct investment had reached US$5.6 billion. Policies have played strong supporting roles in bringing about this trend by facilitating and encouraging Chinese companies to make overseas investments. This working paper summarises these policies based on an analysis of policy changes over time and identifies the main drivers of these changes. It also highlights some key research questions of relevance to deepening understanding of the impacts of Chinese trade and investment in Africa. The project ‘Chinese trade and investment in Africa: Assessing and governing trade-offs to national economies, local livelihoods and forest ecosystems’ project, launched in March 2010, aims to advance understanding of the social, economic and environmental impacts of Chinese investment in commodities or sectors affecting forests and livelihoods in Africa (e.g. timber, mining, agriculture), and to strengthen the capacity of decision-makers in government, civil society and the private sector to enact reforms to maximise social and economic benefits while minimising adverse effects.";"Wenbin, H.

Land use within city boundaries has changed dynamically, accommodating development while replacing traditional land-use patterns. Using Landsat-8 and IRS-P6 data, this study investigated land-use changes in urban and peri-urban Hyderabad and their influence on land-use and land-cover. Advanced methods, such as spectral matching techniques with ground information were deployed in the analysis. From 2005 to 2016, the wastewater-irrigated area adjacent to the Musi river increased from 15,553 to 20,573 hectares, with concurrent expansion of the city boundaries from 38,863 to 80,111 hectares. Opportunistic shifts in land-use, especially related to wastewater-irrigated agriculture, emerged in response to growing demand for fresh vegetables and urban livestock feed, and to easy access to markets due to the city’s expansion. Validation performed on the land-use maps developed revealed 80–85% accuracy.";"Gumma, Murali K.

About one-third of those schemes was fully utilized; one-third partially utilized; and one-third not utilized in the winter of 2015; however, no single socioeconomic, physical, agronomic and marketing variable could explain these differences in utilization. Sale, mostly for informal markets, appeared the most important goal. Dilapidated infrastructure was the most important constraint cited by the farmers. The study recommends ways to overcome the build-neglect-rebuild syndrome, and to learn lessons from informal irrigation, which covers an area three to four times as large as public irrigation schemes in the province.";"Koppen, Barbara C.M. van

In this assessment, land degradation is referred to as the persistent loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused by disturbances from which the land cannot recover without human intervention (unaided). Hotspots are defined as places that experience high land degradation and if left unattended, will negatively affect both human wellbeing and the environment. The spatial location of hotspots was identified through a methodology combining modeling, participatory stakeholder consultations and field validation. Understanding the spatial locations helps identify hotspot areas and target them as priority intervention sites with relevant management options.

Le concept d’agriculture intelligente face au climat (AIC) traduit l’ambition d’assurer une meilleure intégration du développement de l’agriculture et de la réactivité face au climat. Il vise à assurer la sécurité alimentaire et atteindre les objectifs de développement plus larges dans un contexte
marqué par une fluctuation du climat et l’accroissement de la demande alimentaire. Les initiatives d’AIC augmentent de manière durable la productivité et la résilience, réduisent/ éliminent les GES et nécessitent une planification afin de prendre en compte les compromis et synergies entre les trois piliers suivants : la productivité, l’adaptation, et l’atténuation. Les priorités des différents pays et parties prenantes sont prises en compte afin de créer des systèmes alimentaires plus efficients, efficaces et équitables
qui contribuent à relever les défis liés aux dimensions environnementale, sociale et économique dans tous les terroirs de production. Bien que le concept soit nouveau et en pleine évolution, nombre de pratiques qui font partie de l’AIC existent déjà à travers le monde et sont utilisées par les agriculteurs pour faire face à différents risques de production.

"handle:10568/91683";"Institutional linkages and landscape governance systems: The case of Mt. Marsabit, Kenya";"";"The desire to overcome fragmented management of the natural ecosystems on which human beings depend has contributed to a growing interest in landscape approaches and to deeper questions about landscape governance systems. We assessed the emergent governance system that corresponds to the Mt. Marsabit landscape ecosystem in northern Kenya, applying a framework that includes 17 different indicators. We found that in this governance system, the most important spaces where coordination and joint planning took place were district level coordination committees, within which representation of communities and voices from the grassroots was poor. Institutional and organizational linkages were such that those parts of the governance system for which legitimacy and accountability were strongest were the parts for which ability to generate resources was weakest, while the parts of the governance system that had the best access to resources was where accountability was weakest or the most indirect. In this paper we use the Mt. Marsabit case study to explore the role that organizational and institutional linkages play in the strengths and weaknesses of landscape governance systems, and consider the implications for governance design at landscape level. Institutional linkages play a critical role in determining how landscape governance systems function across scales and levels, and their degree of fit. Appropriate linkages can help to create connections among key dimensions of effective governance within the system, dimensions such as use of knowledge, capacity to generate resources, fit, learning, legitimacy, accountability, and responsiveness, strengthening the system as a whole. Of the various linkages that characterize a governance system, it is those that give community-level actors a meaningful voice at higher levels and in spaces where key decisions are being made that are most critical for enabling effective landscape governance.";"Robinson, Lance W.

This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6 years (2000–2005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The developed approach is efficient and effective for regional monitoring of forest cover change. It could be automated for regular usage and monitoring.";"Amarnath, Giriraj

"handle:10568/89639";"Unsustainable development pathways caused by tropical deforestation";"";"Global sustainability strategies require assessing whether countries’ development trajectories are sustainable over time. However, sustainability assessments are limited because losses of natural capital and its ecosystem services through deforestation have not been comprehensively incorporated into national accounts. We update the national accounts of 80 nations that underwent tropical deforestation from 2000 to 2012 and evaluate their development trajectories using weak and strong sustainability criteria. Weak sustainability requires that countries do not decrease their aggregate capital over time. We adopt a strong sustainability criterion that countries do not decrease the value of their forest ecosystem services with respect to the year 2000. We identify several groups of countries: countries, such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India, that present sustainable development trajectories under both weak and strong sustainability criteria; countries, such as Brazil, Peru, and Indonesia, that present weak sustainable development but fail the strong sustainability criterion as a result of rapid losses of ecosystem services; countries, such as Madagascar, Laos, and Papua New Guinea, that present unsustainable development pathways as a result of deforestation; and countries, such as Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, in which deforestation aggravates already unsustainable pathways. Our results reveal a large number of countries where tropical deforestation is both damaging to nature and not compensated by development in other sectors, thus compromising the well-being of their future generations.";"Carrasco, Luis Roman

"handle:10568/91209";"Using electronic syndromic surveillance system to collect animal health and meat inspection records in Marsabit County, Kenya";"";"Introduction: An electronic syndromic surveillance system for collecting, collating and analysing animal health and meat inspection records in Marsabit County, Kenya has been developed.
Architecture: The system comprises a cloud server linked to a series of data collection phones operated by field veterinarians based at the sub-county locations and meat inspectors in abattoirs. Animal health data are collected by sub-county veterinarians during their routine active surveillance missions or via telephone contacts with community disease reporters (CDRs) who are based at the village; these CDRs have been trained on disease recognition and reporting. Each veterinarian is expected to make weekly phone calls to each CDR to check whether there has been any incident that needs to be reported during the intervening period. However, when there is an outbreak, the CDRs from affected village call the veterinarian to whom they report to provide the data. Sub-county veterinarians upload the syndromic reports to the online server at the end of each day. Abattoir data on the other hand are uploaded by the meat inspectors to the database directly at the end of each day. The server has scripts written in Java language for automated data management and analysis. Descriptive results produced include trend graphs, heat maps and word clouds on reported syndromes.
Initial observations: For livestock diseases and syndromes, the system currently indicates that a total of 130 reports have been made over the last six months. The number of reports by sub-county varies from 65 in Laisamis, 46 from Moyale, 14 from Saku and 5 from North Horr. The common syndromes captured in the word cloud include coughing, mucoid nasal discharge, severe breathing difficulties and thickening of the skin. The numbers of cattle slaughtered and inspected in the County abattoirs in the months of September, October and November 2017 were 178, 212 and 203 cattle, respectively. The combined numbers of sheep and goats slaughtered at the same period were 989, 1078 and 1011, respectively. Cases reported from post mortem inspections in the abattoirs included facioliasis, pneumonic lungs, abscesses and cysts.
Conclusion: The system improves the capacity of the department to collect and manage data that could have otherwise been keep in paper forms. The analyses conducted also show a good level of agreement between animal health data and post mortem findings. This is because the common animal health syndromes reported by CDRs were coughing and severe breathing problems, while a high proportion of post mortem cases observed were pneumonic lesions. This demonstrates the utility of using multiple sources of data for triangulation purposes.";"Bodha, Boku

"handle:10568/98457";"Model-based estimation of land subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal";"";"This study is the first to assess land subsidence in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Land subsidence simulations were based on a fully calibrated groundwater (GW) flow model developed using a coupled surface–subsurface modelling system. Subsidence is predicted to occur as a result of deep aquifer compaction due to excessive GW abstraction. The north and north-east areas at the periphery of the GW basin are hotspots for this subsidence. The estimated subsidence is most sensitive to changes in land cover within the recharge areas. The model shows the Melamchi water supply project assists in the control of subsidence to some extent. In the absence of land subsidence measurements, this paper highlights the location and the potential levels of the subsidence hazard which will be useful for hazard prevention management. Additionally, this work provides a basis to design field investigations, monitoring networks for land subsidence and upgrading the present GW monitoring network. Although the study has presented a preliminary analysis, a more comprehensive model inclusive of clay subsidence is required to address the subsidence vulnerability of the central densely populated core of the valley, which reflects the need for a comprehensive database of the hydrogeology in the valley.";"Shrestha, P.

These data are inputs to a statistical model of livestock mortality developed using historical data from the region. When evolving range conditions predict livestock mortality in excess of a critical threshold (say 15%) over a predetermined area, the insurance pays contract-holding pastoralists for their losses, allowing them to manage their individual risk. The programme operates under the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and is delivered by several private sector insurance providers, with financial support from the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the European Union.";"Agency for Rangeland Information and Development in Kenya";"Agency for Rangeland Information and Development in Kenya";"Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Co-operation ACP-EU";"CGIAR";"2018-11-05";"en";"pastoral lands;pastoralists";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"KEN;014;002";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/97904";"";"";"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial";"CC-BY-NC-4.0";"44";"";"101427"

"handle:10568/91536";"Wood extraction among the households of Zege Peninsula, northern Ethiopia";"";"The dependence of smallholder farmers on forest resources for their sustenance and livelihoods is a major driver of deforestation and degradation of forest resources in tropical countries. Understanding the socio-economic drivers that aggravate the extraction and overexploitation of forest products is vital for designing effective forest conservation and restoration measures. This particularly holds with regard to the importance of two fundamentally opposing motivations of smallholder forest exploitation, which we label “wood extraction for need” vs. “wood extraction for greed”. This study was conducted at Zege peninsula in Northern Ethiopia to investigate the factors affecting the extraction and marketing of wood from the peninsula's primary dry Afromontane forest by smallholders. Data was collected using household survey, focus groups discussions and key informant interviews. Data analysis employed the Heckman two-steps econometric model. The predominant involvement of vulnerable households in forest exploitation suggests that wood extraction was driven by need and mainly served sustenance and safety net functions. In addition, we also found evidence of greed-driven forest exploitation. As a consequence of selective rule enforcement and nepotism, the forest enforcement committee was not effective in safeguarding the forest, there by contributing to increased wood extraction and marketing by community members for income generation. This suggests that, in order to protect the forest, interventions are needed that aim at creating alternative income opportunities for smallholders through improved production of non-timber forest products, enhanced market access and the provision of locally adapted technologies; as well as at increasing the integrity of law enforcement.";"Amare, D.

The drainage design differed from traditional subsurface tile drains in two respects: (i) the depth of drains was shallow (30 cm); and (ii) the design did not include a sump and accessories such as pumps (drainage outlets were tidal).
A monsoonal paddy rice crop followed by a winter sunflower crop was evaluated. The experimental treatment was a shallow subsurface drainage system with a drain depth of 0.3 m and drain spacing of 8 m. Measurements of surface flooding depth and groundwater table depth were made weekly and subsurface drainage discharge during managed drainage of the field was measured to determine system responsiveness. The managed subsurface drainage enabled the establishment of the winter sunflower crop 1.5 months earlier than the usual local practice, increased the yield and facilitated safe harvest, avoiding pre-monsoonal rainfall damage. Farmers expressed increased interest in managed subsurface drainage for its potential for early establishment of rabi crops and increased yields in the study area. This study outlines the potential benefits resulting from subsurface drainage in Khulna District.";"Okwany, Romulus O.

"handle:10568/100656";"Mechanizing water lifting through pumps: a case study in Sri Lanka";"";"A reliable supply of water is critical for agricultural intensification and yield improvement. Technological devices that lift, transport and apply water contribute to increased yield from improved crop varieties and high input cultivation. The increasing use of motor pumps is a significant contribution to the development of small-scale irrigation. The objective of this study was to identify and analyze the trajectories of technological innovations and uptake for agricultural water management in farming systems in Sri Lanka, with a special focus on identifying impacts, emerging issues and potential responses to the rapid proliferation of motor pumps in the intensification of agriculture in the country. The Government of Sri Lanka promoted the rapid adoption of water pumps through interventions such as the development of groundwater wells for agriculture; provision of subsidies and credit facilities for purchasing micro-irrigation equipment; and government policies on tax, tariffs and extension support. At the same time, the high profit margin realized from cash crop cultivation motivated farmers to invest in water lifting and related technologies. Finally, water scarcity and restrictions on the use of surface water, i.e., canals, prompted a shift to using water-lifting technologies to pump groundwater. The use of water pumps in agriculture has expanded the area under cultivation; increased cropping intensity, especially during the dry seasons; changed the cropping pattern from low-return rice cultivation to high-return cash crop cultivation; and enhanced household incomes. Expanded and intensified cultivation has provided more opportunities for women to participate in agriculture, generating additional income, and enhancing their purchasing power and decision-making at the household level. Some farmers do not have groundwater wells and water pumps because they lack the necessary capital to make the initial investment. Smallholder farmers, in particular, are reluctant to risk their limited income on new technologies. This may lead to the further marginalization of poor farmers. Inclusive intensification will require helping farmers to access irrigation technology, for example, through carefully targeted subsidies and access to credit. Using water pumps can provide benefits to both users and non-users, but uncontrolled groundwater extraction may also create new problems by putting enormous pressure on common property resources. The government will need to take on a dual role to both promote the inclusive growth of small-scale irrigation, and to prevent and mitigate its negative environmental impacts. This second role may include establishing a regulatory system, setting standards for well construction, and monitoring and enforcing standards on extraction and water quality. There is an urgent need for institutional measures and governance arrangements to guide and regulate groundwater irrigation, especially in the context of intensive cultivation using shallow aquifers.";"Aheeyar, Mohamed

It has been hypothesized that the outcomes of the interactions between carbon-storage and peacebuilding efforts could result in either improved or worsened forest conservation and likewise increased or decreased conflict. Hence, for this study we explore potential interactions between forest carbon-storage and peacebuilding efforts, with Colombia as a case study. Spatial associations between biomass carbon and three conflict-related variables suggest that such interactions may exist. Nonetheless, while priority areas for carbon-focused conservation are presumably those at highest risks of deforestation, our research indicates that forests with lower risk of deforestation are typically those affected by armed-conflict. Our findings moreover highlight three possible roles played by Colombian forested municipalities in armed groups' military strategies: venues for battle, hideouts, and sources of natural resources to finance war.";"Castro-Nuñez, Augusto

"handle:10568/96257";"An analysis of land management stakeholders in Lushoto (Tanzania) and Ntcheu (Malawi).";"";"Widespread land degradation has serious negative ecological, social, and economic consequences. This is particularly true for smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa, which are crucial for the livelihoods of the majority of the population and the national economies. Sustainable land management (SLM) is seen as the best way to combat or even reverse land degradation. However, the contexts and conditions hindering land users’ uptake of SLM techniques are often poorly understood. The AGORA project explores the drivers of land degradation at two sites in Tanzania and Malawi. It focuses on the social and economic hindrances to the adoption of SLM practices. This Working Paper presents key findings of a stakeholder analysis of both sites. The analysis builds on interviews, a stakeholder workshop, and NetMap outputs. It sheds light on particular challenges, especially a lack of support, for successful sustainable land management by smallholders in both sites. Potentials and entry points for improvement lie in existing knowledge on SLM and attempts for coordination of service providers. Some findings were used to initiate a stakeholder engagement process that aims to enhance SLM in the two regions.";"Rosendahl, Judith";"";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture";"CGIAR";"2018-07-31";"en";"land management;farming systems;land use;land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"TZA;002;MWI;014;018";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/96257";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"26";"";"99592"

their experiencing patrimonial violence. This is one of the reasons that, according to our national household assets
survey, the value of women’s assets on average is less than that of men. Nonetheless, there are major differences
in the average value of wealth attained depending on a person’s marital status (being much higher among those
who are married in comparison to living in a consensual union) and in the size of the gender wealth gap (being
greatest among those who are married, widowed or separated).Drawing upon the results of our qualitative field
work in three provinces, we illustrate how these gender wealth gaps by marital status may be the result of patrimonial
violence. Aunque los derechos de propiedad de las mujeres en Ecuador son relativamente fuertes, en la práctica estos derechos
no siempre se cumplen, por lo que genera violencia patrimonial contra ellas. Esta es una de las razones por
lo cual, según nuestra encuesta de hogares sobre los activos a nivel nacional, el valor de los activos de las mujeres
en promedio es menor en comparación con los hombres. A la vez, hay grandes variaciones en el nivel de riqueza
promedio dependiendo del estado civil (siendo mucho más alta entre los que están casados en comparación con
los que están en una unión consensual), y en lo agudo de la brecha de género (ésta siendo mayor entre los casados,
viudos y separados). A través de la información recogida durante la fase cualitativa de la investigación en tres provincias,
proponemos ilustrar cómo se generan estas brechas de género en la riqueza según el estado civil y como
estas pueden ser el resultado de la violencia patrimonial.";"Deere, Carmen Diana

"handle:10568/92086";"Integrating the social, hydrological and ecological dimensions of freshwater health: the freshwater health index";"";"Degradation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide is a primary cause of increasing water insecurity, raising the need for integrated solutions to freshwater management. While methods for characterizing the multi-faceted challenges of managing freshwater ecosystems abound, they tend to emphasize either social or ecological dimensions and fall short of being truly integrative. This paper suggests that management for sustainability of freshwater systems needs to consider the linkages between human water uses, freshwater ecosystems and governance. We present a conceptualization of freshwater resources as part of an integrated social-ecological system and propose a set of corresponding indicators to monitor freshwater ecosystem health and to highlight priorities for management. We demonstrate an application of this new framework —the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) — in the Dongjiang River Basin in southern China, where stakeholders are addressing multiple and conflicting freshwater demands. By combining empirical and modeled datasets with surveys to gauge stakeholders' preferences and elicit expert information about governance mechanisms, the FHI helps stakeholders understand the status of freshwater ecosystems in their basin, how ecosystems are being manipulated to enhance or decrease water-related services, and how well the existing water resource management regime is equipped to govern these dynamics over time. This framework helps to operationalize a truly integrated approach to water resource management by recognizing the interplay between governance, stakeholders, freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide.";"Vollmer, D.

"handle:10568/92084";"Trade-offs in multi-purpose land use under land degradation";"";"Land provides a host of ecosystem services, of which the provisioning services are often considered paramount. As the demand for agricultural products multiplies, other ecosystem services are being degraded or lost entirely. Finding a sustainable trade-off between food production and one or more of other ecosystem services, given the variety of stakeholders, is a matter of optimizing land use in a dynamic and complex socio-ecological system. Land degradation reduces our options to meet both food demands and environmental needs. In order to illustrate this trade-off dilemma, four representative services, carbon sinks, water storage, biodiversity, and space for urbanization, are discussed here based on a review of contemporary literature that cuts across the domain of ecosystem services that are provided by land. Agricultural research will have to expand its focus from the field to the landscape level and in the process examine the cost of production that internalizes environmental costs. In some situations, the public cost of agriculture in marginal environments outweighs the private gains, even with the best technologies in place. Land use and city planners will increasingly have to address the cost of occupying productive agricultural land or the conversion of natural habitats. Landscape designs and urban planning should aim for the preservation of agricultural land and the integrated management of land resources by closing water and nutrient cycles, and by restoring biodiversity.";"Vlek, P.

Understanding where and how waters comes into and leaves the delta is therefore a crucial question for the future of the country. This paper revisits the surface and groundwater balances of the delta, emphasizes the additional relevance of drainage water reuse and of the salt balance, and evidences a relative stability of the outflow to the sea over the past 30 years. Various reasons for such a phenomenon and the scope for saving water are explored and discussed. The confusion between plot-level and delta-level efficiency and the relatively limited gains possible are emphasized. Beyond the overall water balance and quantitative issues, water management in the delta remains a complex task of spatially distributing the resource over a complex ramified network. Finally, limitations in the analysis related to data availability and accuracy are emphasized.";"Molle, Francois

"handle:10568/92573";"Farmers’ perceptions of crop pest severity in Nigeria are associated with landscape, agronomic and socio-economic factors";"";"Insect pests are a major cause of crop yield losses around the world and pest management plays a critical role in providing food security and farming income. This study links Nigerian farmers’ perceptions of pest severity to the landscape, agronomic, biophysical, and socio-economic context in which agricultural production takes place. A farm household survey was conducted during 2012–2013, collecting data on household characteristics, cropping systems, pest severity and pest management from 805 households in 12 states of Nigeria. Village characteristics and land use information were collected from an accompanying semi-structured village survey. Reported pest severity was negatively associated with the proportions of forest and unused land at the landscape scale. This finding suggests the existence of pest suppressive effects of a diverse landscape under African smallholder agriculture settings, confirming findings of more industrial and larger scale agroecosystems in the temperate zone. Application of fertilizers (chemical and manure) was negatively related to reported pest severity. Moreover, reported pest severity was lower in mixed-cropping systems than in mono-cropping systems, reinforcing the idea of a pest suppression benefit of diverse cropping systems. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the presence of non-crop areas in the landscape and the diversification of agroecosystems may be a viable strategy for smallholder farmers to manage pests with limited reliance of chemical insecticides in Nigeria, but that actual pest management decisions are influenced by a wide range of context-specific factors. The paper adds new evidence on the relationship between different production situation characteristics and pest severity for Nigeria, based on which policy implications are discussed.";"Zhang, Wei

"handle:10568/91673";"Pathways from research on improved staple crop germplasm to poverty reduction for smallholder farmers";"";"Innovations to improve staple crop germplasm can reduce poverty and otherwise improve farmer livelihoods through complex and multiple pathways. This paper reviews the evidence for one prominent pathway—through increased incomes (in cash and kind) for poor farmers who adopt the technology.

An important determinant of poverty reduction is the ability of poor producers to adopt productivity-enhancing varieties, and the paper analyzes recent household-level data from two African countries to examine if poor producers face unique barriers to adoption. A second determinant of poverty reduction is the area available to plant these varieties and whether the intensity of adoption is great enough to significantly reduce poverty. The paper uses a double-hurdle estimation framework to model the adoption/area planted joint decision for maize farmers in Ethiopia and sweet potato farmers in Uganda. The focus of the analysis is the effect of poverty-related variables on adoption/area planted decisions. Farmer wealth, landholding, education, location, and access to support and information services are included to understand how correlates of poverty affect adoption decisions.

We find evidence that landholding size is an important barrier to poverty reduction; poor farmers are able to adopt improved varieties, but their intensity is constrained by land availability. In Uganda, farmers at the 95th percentile of adoption area received about $0.13 per person per day from the incremental yield, covering < 50% of the mean household poverty gap. This gain only comes under optimistic assumptions and most adopters do not have sufficient area for the direct income effect to be large. The evidence suggests that direct, short-term impacts of increased productivity to increased income may be limited in magnitude. Nonetheless, we recognize that other, less direct pathways may be important, particularly over longer times. Impacts through indirect pathways are, however, more difficult to measure. This has implications for the design of M&E and the crafting of appropriate targets for outcomes of research on staple crops which should focus perhaps on the other pathways where poverty reduction is more probable.";"Alwang, Jeffrey

"handle:10568/81497";"An expert system model for mapping tropical wetlands and peatlands reveals South America as the largest contributor";"";"Wetlands are important providers of ecosystem services and key regulators of climate change. They positively contribute to global warming through their greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively through the accumulation of organic material in histosols, particularly in peatlands. Our understanding of wetlands’ services is currently constrained by limited knowledge on their distribution, extent, volume, interannual flood variability and disturbance levels. We present an expert system approach to estimate wetland and peatland areas, depths and volumes, which relies on three biophysical indices related to wetland and peat formation: (1) long-term water supply exceeding atmospheric water demand; (2) annually or seasonally water-logged soils; and (3) a geomorphological position where water is supplied and retained. Tropical and subtropical wetlands estimates reach 4.7 million km2 (Mkm2). In line with current understanding, the American continent is the major contributor (45%), and Brazil, with its Amazonian interfluvial region, contains the largest tropical wetland area (800,720 km2). Our model suggests, however, unprecedented extents and volumes of peatland in the tropics (1.7 Mkm2 and 7,268 (6,076–7,368) km3), which more than threefold current estimates. Unlike current understanding, our estimates suggest that South America and not Asia contributes the most to tropical peatland area and volume (ca. 44% for both) partly related to some yet unaccounted extended deep deposits but mainly to extended but shallow peat in the Amazon Basin. Brazil leads the peatland area and volume contribution. Asia hosts 38% of both tropical peat area and volume with Indonesia as the main regional contributor and still the holder of the deepest and most extended peat areas in the tropics. Africa hosts more peat than previously reported but climatic and topographic contexts leave it as the least peat-forming continent. Our results suggest large biases in our current understanding of the distribution, area and volumes of tropical peat and their continental contributions.";"Gumbricht, Thomas

It is the principal water source for Nairobi, the capital city, providing water for hydroelectric power generation and irrigation. Several of the flagship projects laid out in Vision 2030 - the blueprint that guides Kenya’s national development – are located in the basin. This report presents the findings of a study to determine the possible impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the basin. Data from seven Regional Circulation Models (RCMs), simulating two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), were used as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model. For both RCPs, rainfall is projected to increase across the basin over the remainder of the twenty-first century. Associated increases in water yield, groundwater recharge and baseflow point to an improved water resource situation in the future. However, declining natural flow regulation, increased variability, and considerable increases in the frequency and magnitude of floods pose a risk that threatens to undermine development opportunities. Water resource management will be much more difficult than under historic climatic conditions.";"Sood, Aditya

In this assessment, land degradation is referred to as the persistent loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused by disturbances from which the land cannot recover without human intervention (unaided). Hotspots are defined as places that experience high land degradation and if left unattended, will negatively affect both human wellbeing and the environment. The spatial location of hotspots was identified through a methodology combining modeling, participatory stakeholder consultations and field validation.
Understanding the spatial locations helps identify hotspot areas and target them as priority intervention sites with relevant management options.

"handle:10568/91542";"Ecosystem-based interventions and farm household welfare in degraded areas: comparative evidence from Ethiopia";"";"Agricultural productivity and farm household welfare in areas of severe land degradation can be improved through ecosystem-based interventions. Decisions on the possible types of practices and investments can be informed using evidence of potential benefits. Using farm household data together with a farm level stochastic simulation model provides an initial quantification of farm income and nutrition outcomes that can be generated over a five year period from manure and compost based organic amendment of crop lands. Simulated results show positive income and nutrition impacts. Mean farm income increases by 13% over the planning period, from US$32,833 under the business as usual situation (application of 50 kg DAP and 25 kg urea ha- 1 yr- 1) to US$37,172 under application of 10 t ha- 1 yr- 1 farm yard manure during the first three years and 5 t ha- 1 yr- 1 during the last two years. As a result of organic soil amendment, there is an associated increase in the available calorie, protein, fat, calcium, and iron per adult equivalent, giving the improvement in farm household nutrition. The evidence is substantive enough to suggest the promotion and adoption at scale, in degraded ecosystems, of low cost organic soil amendment practices to improve agricultural productivity and subsequent changes in farm household welfare.";"Getnet, K.

"handle:10568/91543";"Long-term livestock exclosure did not affect soil carbon in southern Ethiopian rangelands";"";"Controlled grazing management is considered as an effective strategy to enhance soil carbon sequestration, but empirical evidences are scarce. Particularly, the role of livestock exclusion related to soil carbon sequestration is not well understood in arid and semiarid savannas of Africa. We investigated the effectiveness of long-term (14–36 years old) exclosures in enhancing soil carbon in the semiarid savanna, southern Ethiopia. We tested for differences in soil carbon content between exclosures and adjacent open-grazed rangelands, while accounting for effects of age of exclosures and soil depths. We collected soil samples at two soil depths (0–20 cm and 20–50 cm depths) from 96 plots from 12 exclosure and adjacent open grazing sites. We found no significant differences (P > 0.05) between exclosures and adjacent open-grazed rangelands in soil carbon content in both soil depths. The age chronosequence further suggested a weak non-linear trend in increasing soil carbon content with increasing duration of exclosures. These results thus challenge the opinion that controlled grazing enhances soil carbon sequestration in semiarid savannas. However, we remain cautious in regard to the conclusiveness of these findings given the paucity of information regarding other confounding factors which may disentangle the effects of the exclosure, and most importantly in the absence of soil data prior to exclosures.";"Aynekulu, Ermias

"handle:10568/20680";"Biofuel finance: global trends in biofuel finance in forest-rich countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America and implications for governance";"";"Since 2000, US$ 2.0-2.7 billion has been invested in feedstock cultivation for biofuel in 16 forest-rich countries, mostly in oil palm and sugarcane. An additional US$ 5.7-6.7 billion has been invested in biofuel production, especially sugar-based ethanol. While investments in some countries are driven by domestic policies to reduce fossil fuel imports, most are export driven. Sugar-based ethanol offers more opportunities to capture value added than biodiesel feedstocks which are amenable to export and processing abroad. Financing sources for biofuel and related feedstock investments are very diverse, involving domestic and foreign entrepreneurs, state-owned companies, government agencies, public and private banks and institutional investors. Foreign investors play an important role in most forest-rich countries, especially in Africa. To sustain growing demand, significant amounts of new investment are anticipated. Most investors are not yet effectively addressing sustainability challenges in the biofuel sector because they lack responsible investment policies or they are insufficiently robust. Only a few banks have developed responsible investment policies specifically on biofuels. The private financial sector has not yet followed multilateral financial institutions in creating mediation procedures to address grievances of people harmed or potentially harmed by projects financed by their institutions. Responsible investment instruments in the biofuel sector need to be based on an internationally agreed set of principles, criteria and indicators which are measurable, reportable and verifiable; should be applied to all forms of private and public finance provided to all companies in the supply chain; and should be strengthened by independent compliance and monitoring processes. Governments should stimulate and support private financial institutions to develop and apply sound responsible investment policies and instruments.";"Gelder, J.W. van

"handle:10568/92363";"Estimation of specific yield using water table fluctuations and cropped area in a hardrock aquifer system of Rajasthan, India";"";"Assessment of specific yields is important for effective groundwater management in semi-arid hardrock aquifers, especially in India with its unsustainable groundwater usage rates. The Dharta watershed in the Udaipur district of Rajasthan is one such hardrock area in India where the groundwater extraction rate is a concern. In this study, we use groundwater balance analysis to estimate the specific yield (Sy) based on crop irrigation water use and changes in water table depths, during the irrigation season, to develop an understanding of the volume of groundwater recharge from pre and post monsoon water table depths and an understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in estimates of specific yield in the study area. The analysis used here estimates values at village scale (average area 3.65 km2) and is a technique compatible with the farmers monitoring of groundwater levels to facilitate local cooperative groundwater management. Five villages in the Dharta watershed in Rajasthan were selected and 50 wells per village were monitored for water table depth, at weekly intervals, over a two-year period. This resulted in a total of 250 wells in the study area and the monitoring was carried out by local farmer volunteers - called Bhujal Jankaars (BJs), a Hindi word meaning ‘groundwater informed.’ Crop area coverage (with a total of 40 crops) was examined for two years in the study area. Estimates of Sy in the five villages were between 1.4 and 8%, resulting in values comparable with previous studies. The watershed area-weighted average Sy was 3.8%. The method used in this study enabled estimates of recharge without needing a calibrated groundwater model in an area with sparse information on aquifer hydraulic characteristics and unreliable digital elevation maps.";"Chinnasamy, Pennan

"handle:10568/92565";"Can the production of wild forest foods be sustained in timber concessions? Logging and the availability of edible caterpillars hosted by sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) and tali (Erythrophleum suaveolens) trees in the Democratic Republic of Congo";"";"Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) and tali (Erythrophleum suaveolens) are among the most important timber
species harvested from Congo Basin forests. They also host edible caterpillars, Imbrasia oyemensis and Cirina
forda, respectively, which are important to the nutrition and income of rural and urban populations. This study
evaluated the density of these tree species within a 10 km radius around each of 4 villages and in the 2012
annual cutting areas of two timber concessions in the region of Kisangani (DRC). Sapelli and tali trees
≥20 cm dbh and their stumps were identiﬁed and measured on 21 ﬁve ha plots around each village and 20 ﬁve
ha plots on each concession. Around villages and on concessions, sapelli trees occurred at densities of
0.048 ± 0.008 harvestable trees (≥80 cm dbh) ha −1 and 0.135 ± 0.019 precommercial trees ha −1.
Harvestable tali trees (≥60 cm dbh) were seven times more abundant at 0.347 ± 0.032 ha −1, while pre-
commercial tali trees occurred at densities of 0.329 ± 0.033 trees ha −1. Between 25% and 40% of the har-
vestable sapelli trees had been logged as compared to < 3% of the harvestable tali trees. Production per tree,
derived from another study, was extrapolated to estimate caterpillar yields on a half circle of 15,700 ha within
10 km of villages, using these estimates of tree densities. Depending on the village, yields were estimated as
11.6–34.5 Mg year −1 of I. oyemensis from sapelli trees, and 65.8–80.9 Mg year −1 of C. forda from tali trees, an
average of 0.74–2.2 kg ha −1 year and 4.2–5.2 kg ha −1 year, fresh weight, respectively (0.23–0.68 kg ha −1
year −1 and 1.3–1.6 kg ha −1 year −1, dry weight, respectively). Harvestable trees yielded
more caterpillars, providing most of the C. forda caterpillars. However, because harvestable sapelli trees oc-
curred at low densities, the bulk of I. oyemensis caterpillar production would be hosted on precommercial trees.
Logging practices that reject poorly formed or hollow trees and guidelines that call for high minimum diameter
limits and retention of seed trees or prohibit logging on slopes or riparian zones, safeguard edible caterpillar
production. Multiple resource management for multiple stakeholders would require more deliberate planning
and management approaches based on negotiations with local communities and approaches like setting aside
collection zones or collection trees that would be protected from logging.";"Muvatsi, P.

Harvesters and producers need better access to trees and land to promote better management and reduce conflicts. The tax system for woodfuel should be revised to be transparent and pragmatic. Woodfuel from plantation forests and agroforestry should be favoured over woodfuel from valuable or threatened tree species. More attention should be paid to energy-efficient charcoal kilns and cooking stoves, as well as activities to promote their use. Management options that combine agroforestry, plantations and improving energy efficiency need collaboration from different sectors: energy, forest, land-use planning and agriculture.";"Schure, J.

Por el contrario, los resultados de la investigacion en suelos acidos de baja fertilidad natural y baja retencion de humedad, representados por las condiciones prevalentes en el litoral Pacifico de Panama, no son muy halagadores por el momento, justificando la necesidad de realizar una investigacion mas amplia en estos suelos. Se sugiere ademas considerar las ventajas comparativas de los suelos fertiles para la produccion de cultivos alimenticios con una rentabilidad posiblemente mayor. En cuanto a transferencia de tegnologia al productor de ganado de carne, si bien es cierto que no existen modelos adecuados que puedan ser aplicados a todas las posibles situaciones de los paises de America Latina, la experiencia en Ecuador y Panama sugiere la necesidad de desarrollar una investigacion con metas practicas, definidas y relacionadas con programas de desarrollo ganadero apoyados por proyectos de credito. Por otro lado, se deberia integrar la investigacion con demostraciones a nivel del productor y adiestramiento de jovenes profesionales en aspectos de evaluacion, adaptacion y adopcion de tegnologias nuevas, asi como aspectos socioeconomicos de la industria ganadera.

"handle:10568/92140";"Conjunctive management of surface and groundwater in transboundary watercourses: a first assessment";"";"Cooperative management of transboundary river basins is widely recognized as important. Emphasis on joint management of shared aquifers has also grown in recent years. Perhaps surprisingly, despite abundant focus on transboundary surface water and growing focus on shared groundwater, there is scant focus on their intersection. To address this knowledge limitation, this article reviews experiences in transboundary water treaties oriented toward different water sources, in order to: i) understand how transboundary water institutions vary according to the water source to which they are oriented, ii) gauge the nature and strength of conjunctive transboundary water management treaties, and iii) identify ways to enhance conjunctive water management in transboundary contexts. The results reveal the existence of more than 50 treaties that make mention of both water sources. Nonetheless, only eight treaties devote ‘substantive’ focus to both surface and groundwater. Review of treaty contents reveals that their focus is on ‘softer’ issues related to institutional development. Moving forward, the reality that the evolution of conjunctive treaties is relatively nascent, and that scope of such treaties is still limited to institutional issues, may indicate large untapped potential – it may be time to outline pathways toward practical implementation of conjunctive water management in transboundary contexts.";"Lautze, Jonathan

"handle:10568/88129";"Total and heterotrophic soil respiration in a swamp forest and oil palm plantations on peat in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia";"";"Heterotrophic respiration is a major component of the soil C balance however we critically lack understanding of its variation upon conversion of peat swamp forests in tropical areas. Our research focused on a primary peat swamp forest and two oil palm plantations aged 1 (OP2012) and 6 years (OP2007). Total and heterotrophic soil respiration were monitored over 13 months in paired control and trenched plots. Spatial variability was taken into account by differentiating hummocks from hollows in the forest; close to palm from far from palm positions in the plantations. Annual total soil respiration was the highest in the oldest plantation (13.8 ± 0.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1) followed by the forest and youngest plantation (12.9 ± 0.3 and 11.7 ± 0.4 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively). In contrast, the contribution of heterotrophic to total respiration and annual heterotrophic respiration were lower in the forest (55.1 ± 2.8%; 7.1 ± 0.4 Mg C ha−1 year−1) than in the plantations (82.5 ± 5.8 and 61.0 ± 2.3%; 9.6 ± 0.8 and 8.4 ± 0.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in the OP2012 and OP2007, respectively). The use of total soil respiration rates measured far from palms as an indicator of heterotrophic respiration, as proposed in the literature, overestimates peat and litter mineralization by around 21%. Preliminary budget estimates suggest that over the monitoring period, the peat was a net C source in all land uses; C loss in the plantations was more than twice the loss observed in the forest.";"Hergoualc’h, Kristell

"handle:10568/91317";"Trees, soils, and warthogs - distribution of services and disservices from reforestation areas in southern Ethiopia";"";"Conservation projects have often been criticised for creating global benefits while causing negative impacts on local livelihoods. Ecosystem services approaches have been seen as one way to change this by focussing explicitly on maintaining ecosystems for human well-being of stakeholders at various scales. However, ecosystem services approaches have often ignored trade-offs between groups of people and issues of power and do not automatically lead to better outcomes in terms of human well-being. Here we report on a study on the impacts of reforestation projects with an explicit focus on human well-being in three communities in southern Ethiopia. We investigated the distribution of services and disservices from reforestation using qualitative methods. Results showed that the services and disservices from reforestation were distributed unequally across space and wealth groups resulting in widespread dissatisfaction with existing reforestation projects despite the explicit focus on human benefits. To improve outcomes of reforestation it is necessary to acknowledge and manage disservices adaptively, include issues of power and make trade-offs transparent.";"Byg, A.

"handle:10568/97419";"Global-scale comparisons of human land use: developing shared terminology for land-use practices for global change";"";"Human land-use practices have been highly variable over the course of the Holocene, a diversity evident in the differentiated effects of human activity on land cover. Historically, agriculture was one of the most significant forms of land use, but even mobile hunter-gatherers transformed land cover through landscape-scale burning (Bliege Bird 2008). Livestock-keeping, plowing, irrigation, and the production of metal, ceramics, and bricks, have also been drivers of historical change. It is important to understand the aggregate effects of anthropic activities on the Earth system, but significant challenges are posed by: (1) the complexity, diversity and mosaic nature of human land use itself (Fig. 1); (2) the need to develop a uniform vocabulary and terminology for land-use practices around the globe and across the span of human history; (3) the sheer quantity of evidence to be analyzed; and (4) the lack of a tradition of global-scale comparisons. Nevertheless, there is a deep reservoir of expertise about land-use and land-cover transitions waiting to be tapped. One goal of LandCover6k is to improve understanding of the relationships between land-use and land-cover changes (Gaillard et al., this issue). By comparing land-use and land-cover trends, we can better disentangle anthropogenic forms of land- cover change from climatic or other drivers.";"Morrison, K.D.

"handle:10568/20833";"Ecosystem services certification: Opportunities and constraints";"";"A major challenge in trading ecosystem services is the need to quantify and commoditise services, for monitoring and verification as well as for trade. This is relatively straightforward for goods such as forest honey or shade-grown coffee, but potentially complex for services such as water purification, reducing risk from floods or other disasters or carbon sequestration. Developing certification systems for forest ecosystem services is one potential way to define, quantify and verify these services in a way that buyers can trust, and this is why certification of ecosystem services is promoted by a number of environmental and forestry NGOs. Certification of ecosystem services is a useful concept, but many practical and theoretical obstacles must be addressed before it can be put into practice. This paper is a review of existing development in certification of ecosystem services, with information useful for designing and implementing projects to evaluate the efficacy of new systems. We discuss the potential use of more holistic concepts for measuring management sustainability, which are to date undeveloped and untested, and recommend developing pilot projects that are specifically designed to address a number of challenges inherent to ecosystem service certification.";"Meijaard, E.

This report is a synthesis of some main findings of preliminary scoping studies conducted by CIFOR and partners in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. It focuses on how Chinese trade and investment in the forestry, mining and agricultural sectors might relate to effects on forests and forest-dependent communities in the region. All studies were conducted under the CIFOR project ‘Chinese trade and investment in Africa: Assessing and governing trade-offs to national economies, local livelihoods and forest ecosystems’, initiated in 2010. The scoping studies yielded useful results, including an increased understanding of the main trends in natural resources trade between the target countries and China, and the major land-based productive sectors targeted by Chinese investors. The studies also considered the role of national agencies tasked with promoting investment and overseeing corporate adherence to environmental and social requirements, and provided a better understanding of the informal processes surrounding investment and acquisition of land and other resources.";"Putzel, L.

"handle:10568/98952";"Using smart ICT to provide weather and water information tosmallholders in Africa: the case of the Gash River Basin, Sudan";"";"In the Gash Delta of Eastern Sudan, spate irrigation (flood-recession farming) contributes substantially to rural livelihoods by providing better yields than rainfed dryland farming. However, spate irrigation farmers are challenged by the unpredictability of flooding. In recent decades, the number of farmers practicing spate irrigation has decreased, due to varying rainfall intensity and frequency, insufficient infrastructure and farmers’ limited capacity to manage such variations. One solution that may help farmers face such challenges is for them to access real-time water-related information by using smart Information and Communication a Technology (ICT). This paper shows how integrating remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), flood-forecasting models and communication platforms can, in near real time, alert smallholder farmers and relevant government departments about incoming floods, using the Gash basin of Sudan as an example. The Ministry of Water Resources of Sudan used the findings of this study to transform farmers’ responses to flood arrival from being ‘reactive’, to planning for the flood event. Intensive on-site and institutional efforts to build the capacity of farmers, farmer organizations, development departments and officers of the Ministry helped to develop the initiative from simply sending ‘emergency alerts’ to enabling stakeholders to visually see the flood event unfolding in the region and to plan accordingly for storing water, operating spate-irrigation systems and undertaking cropping activities. The research, initially conducted on a 60 × 60 km site, was later extended to the entire Gash basin. The paper outlines how to develop tools that can monitor plot-specific information from satellite measurements, and supply detailed and specific information on crops, rather than providing very general statements on crop growth. Farmers are able to use such tools to optimize their farm profits by providing water to their crops in the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity. Finally, the work demonstrates the high potential of combining technology, namely remote sensing data and simple a agro-meteorological model with limited parameters, for large-scale monitoring of spate irrigation systems and information sharing to advise farmers as to how to apply this information to their managerial decisions.";"Amarnath, Giriraj

"handle:10568/98953";"The effect of irrigation service delivery and training in agronomy on crop choice in Tajikistan";"";"The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of irrigation delivery services and agricultural extension services on crop choice in southern Tajikistan. This analysis is motivated by the government’s recent efforts to address the country’s severe malnutrition problem by supporting changes in irrigation service delivery and agronomy to increase diversity in agricultural production and consumption, in an environment where the cultivation of cotton had, until recently, been mandatory. Water management in Tajikistan has largely been transferred to the community through the creation of water users’ associations (WUAs), which were established between 2011 and 2013. While all WUAs received training to improve irrigation delivery services, some also received training in cultivating alternative crops and improving cultivation practices through agricultural extension services. Through specific empirical analysis conducted on a primary panel dataset of 1855 farms in southern Tajikistan, we identify the extent to which improvements in irrigation services, and agronomy training through extension services affect decisions pertaining to cultivated areas of cotton and wheat (the traditional crops) and the cultivated area and number of (newer) high-value crops. We also examine the effect of water delivery and agricultural extension services on crop diversity and cropping intensity (how often land is used in a calendar year). We find that improvements in irrigation delivery services affect cultivated areas of cotton and wheat. Cultivation of high value crops is significantly influenced by agricultural extension services. While cropping intensity depends on water delivery services, crop diversity depends on extension services. From a policy perspective, these results highlight the importance of agricultural programs for stimulating agricultural value added in landscapes historically characterized by limited crop choice and a collapse of the agricultural sector.";"Buisson, M.

"handle:10568/81706";"Control cultural de las malezas en yuca";"";"Some cultural control measures of weeds in cassava are discussed: quality of the material, planting system and density, density x plant type interaction and use of mulching. In order to study the interaction plant type x planting density, var. M Mex 59 (vigorous) and M Col 22 (nonvigorous) were planted in plots of 7500 and 15,000 plants/ha; and 3 levels of weed control were established: complete, intermediate and no control. The vigorous var. was less than sensitive to a deficiency in control than the nonvigorous var.; the increase in fresh root yield reached up to 60 percent at high densities. Different materials for mulching were evaluated at Carimagua and CIAT (Colombia), obtaining effective weed control with corn husks, hay from Hyparrhenia rufa and Stylosanthes guyanensis, and sugar cane leaves. Moreover, 2 cover crops (Desmodiutn heterophyllum and Phaseolus vulgaris) were evaluated, as well as cane bagasse, chemical control and continuous manual weeding systems. Highest yields in cassava were obtained with weeding 22, 40, 60 and 115 days after planting, but it was the most expensive because of the labor. The 2 cover crops are valid choices for their effectiveness, but their high cost justifies their use only when seed is produced locally and with family labor. Intercropping systems and different weed control practices were studied whereby the stabilizing effect of the cassava yield was verified and the utilization of legumes with short growing cycles was shown to reduce weed growth. It is concluded that there are many possibilities of combining cultural weed control with other measures to permit the farmer to choose between capital or labor input. (CIAT)||Se describen algunas medidas de control cultural de malezas en yuca: calidad del material; sistema y densidad de siembra; interaccion tipo de planta x densidad y uso de coberturas. Para estudiar la interaccion tipo de planta x densidad de siembra, se sembraron las var. M Mex 59 (Vigorosa) y M Col 22 (no vigorosa) en parcelas de 7500 y 15.000 plantas/ha y se establecieron 3 niveles de control de malezas: completo, intermedio y sin control. La var. vigorosa fue menos sensible a una deficiencia en el control que la var. no vigorosa; el incremento del rendimiento de raices frescas alcanzo hasta un 60 por ciento empleando la densidad de siembra alta. En Carimagua y CIAT (Colombia) se evaluaron diferentes materiales como cobertura, y se obtuvo buen control de malezas, con paja de maiz, heno de pasto puntero (Hyparrhenia rufa) y de Stylosanthes guyanensis, y hojas de cana de azucar. Se evaluaron ademas 2 coberturas verdes (Desmodium heterophyllum y Phaseolus vulgaris) junto con bagazo de cana y sistemas de control quimico y manual continuo. El mas alto rendimiento de la yuca se obtuvo con desyerbas a los 22, 40, 60 y 115 dias de la siembra, pero fue el de mayor costo de mano de obra. Los 2 sistemas de coberturas verdes aparecen como opciones validas por su efectividad, pero su alto costo solo justifica su empleo cuando la semilla se produce localmente y la mano de obra es familiar. Se estudiaron sistemas de cultivo intercalado y diferentes practicas de manejo de malezas, con los cuales se confirmo el efecto estabilizador del rendimiento de la yuca, y se demostro que la utilizacion de leguminosas de ciclo vegetativo corto reduce el crecimiento de las malezas. Se concluye que existen muchas posibilidades de combinar el control cultural de malezas con otras medidas para permitir al agricultor escoger entre insumos de capital o mano de obra.

"handle:10568/93406";"Improving the accuracy of remotely sensed irrigated areas using post-classification enhancement through UAV [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] capability";"";"Although advances in remote sensing have enhanced mapping and monitoring of irrigated areas, producing accurate cropping information through satellite image classification remains elusive due to the complexity of landscapes, changes in reflectance of different land-covers, the remote sensing data selected, and image processing methods used, among others. This study extracted agricultural fields in the former homelands of Venda and Gazankulu in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation. Ground truth points totaling 137 were collected during fieldwork for pre-processing and accuracy assessment. An accuracy of 96% was achieved on the mapped agricultural fields, yet the irrigated area map produced an initial accuracy of only 71%. This study explains and improves the 29% error margin from the irrigated areas. Accuracy was enhanced through post-classification correction (PCC) using 74 post-classification points randomly selected from the 2015 irrigated area map. High resolution aerial photographs of the 74 sample fields were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to give a clearer picture of the irrigated fields. The analysis shows that mapped irrigated fields that presented anomalies included abandoned croplands that had green invasive alien species or abandoned fruit plantations that had high NDVI values. The PCC analysis improved irrigated area mapping accuracy from 71% to 95%.";"Nhamo, Luxon

"handle:10568/83361";"Below the radar: the boom of groundwater use in the central part of the Nile Delta in Egypt";"";"The Nile Delta of Egypt is known for its large irrigated area supplied with water diverted from the Nile River, with a limited use of groundwater, largely for domestic and industrial use. Official statistics for the whole delta indicate that there are a few thousand individual wells used for agriculture by a population of over 2 million farmers. This study, however, shows that a phenomenon of groundwater development for irrigation has been unfolding over the last few years, largely below the radar of managers and researchers. A survey was carried out in the central part of the delta with the objective of (1) uncovering the actual situation of groundwater use in this part of the delta and (2) speculating on its implications. The results of the survey pointed to a recent and booming tube-well drilling industry, with well densities in some parts reaching one well every 2 ha. The development of groundwater abstraction in the central delta is strongly linked to inadequate and/or untimely availability of surface water in the canals. A technical, economic, and management characterization of wells complements the study, showing a continuum between purely private/individual ownership of wells and collective investments and management. Lastly, the article explores the implications of unchecked abstraction at the farm, local and delta scales.";"El-Agha, Doaa E.

"handle:10568/83362";"Perceptions of groundwater degradation and mitigation responses in the Haouaria region in Tunisia";"";"Avoiding the negative effects of intensive groundwater resource use is challenging, especially when the interactions and causal pathways between biophysical and socioeconomic processes are complex, and when users, management, and regulatory bodies are spatially dispersed. The plain of Haouaria, in north-eastern Tunisia, has witnessed an important development of groundwater abstraction, fueled by the multiplication of wells tapping the underlying shallow and deep aquifers. As the economic activities linked to such development are threatened by the degradation of groundwater quantity and quality, the aim of this paper is to investigate actors’ perceptions of these processes and to emphasize the undertaken mitigation measures. The study builds on semi-directive surveys with the different groundwater users and archive data in order to understand the technical, institutional and agricultural practices driving groundwater development. The paper starts by investigating the historical context of groundwater development and the progressive degradation of the resource. Then, the paper identifies the main constraints and adaptation strategies of the various users (public and private), before examining the challenges faced by groundwater users. Results show varied patterns of actors' behavior, interest, and perception of the groundwater resource. This analysis show that farmers' lack of collective action, land tenure insecurity, labor shortage, the monopoly of production inputs by suppliers, and the cost of energy for pumping are the main challenges faced by groundwater users. The study finally explores different management and policy options that can lead to a more environmentally and socioeconomically sustainable socio-hydrological system.";"Mekki, I.

"handle:10568/83365";"Estimating technical and irrigation water productivities in rice production in Tamil Nadu, India";"";"The overall measure of farm-level technical efficiency is generally used to derive recommendations for the use of individual inputs. In this paper, joint estimation is made of technical and individual input-use (e.g. irrigation water productivity) efficiencies. This indicates that overall technical efficiency is not an indication of the efficiency level of all the individual inputs used. This is because the efficiency of individual inputs may vary and suggests that greater effort should be made to improve such efficiencies in comparison with overall technical efficiency. The model is applied to rice production in four tank-irrigated districts in Tamil Nadu, India, which is one of the most important tank-irrigated areas in India. The average technical efficiency is 62.8%, which indicates that in order to achieve the present level of production, 62.8% of the current level of input resources is sufficient. Average irrigation water productivity is estimated at ~34%, indicating that current output levels could be achieved with 66% less irrigation water. These findings also suggest the need for improvements in crop and water productivity. Thus, the paper makes a contribution in the form of a methodology development for possible adoption in future irrigation water productivity studies.";"Kuppannan, Palanisami

"handle:10568/99332";"Mixed-species allometric equations and estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks in restoring degraded landscape in northern Ethiopia";"";"Accurate biomass estimation is critical to quantify the changes in biomass and carbon stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. However, there is lack of site-specific allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), which consequently limits our understanding of the contributions of restoration efforts in mitigating climate change. This study was conducted in northwestern Ethiopia to develop a multi-species allometric equation and investigate the spatial and temporal variation of C-stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. We harvested and weighed 84 trees from eleven dominant species from six grazing exclosures and adjacent communal grazing land. We observed that AGB correlates significantly with diameter at stump height D 30 (R 2 = 0.78; P < 0.01), and tree height H (R 2 = 0.41, P < 0.05). Our best model, which includes D 30 and H as predictors explained 82% of the variations in AGB. This model produced the lowest bias with narrow ranges of errors across different diameter classes. Estimated C-stock showed a significant positive correlation with stem density (R 2 = 0.80, P < 0.01) and basal area (R 2 = 0.84, P < 0.01). At the watershed level, the mean C-stock was 3.8 (±0.5) Mg C ha−1. Plot-level C-stocks varied between 0.1 and 13.7 Mg C ha−1. Estimated C-stocks in three- and seven-year-old exclosures exceeded estimated C-stock in the communal grazing land by 50%. The species that contribute most to C-stocks were Leucaena sp. (28%), Calpurnia aurea (21%), Euclea racemosa (20.9%), and Dodonaea angustifolia (15.8%). The equations developed in this study allow monitoring changes in C-stocks and C-sequestration following the implementation of restoration practices in northern Ethiopia over space and time. The estimated C-stocks can be used as a reference against which future changes in C-stocks can be compared.";"Mokria, M.

We used a participatory appraisal approach to find out and rank infectious diseases of concern to pastoralists in a zone of intense wildlife-livestock interaction and another zone with limited interactions. Four villages were selected purposively in areas with intensive cattle-wildlife interactions (zone 1), and another two in areas with low to moderate cattle-wildlife interactions (zone 2). Data were collected in focus group discussions (FGDs) using participatory epidemiological methods (PE); each group had 8–13 participants. Results of impact matrix scoring from all sites indicated that malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), anthrax, foot and mouth disease (FMD), contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), east coast fever (ECF) and African animal trypanosomiasis (ATT), in decreasing order, had the highest impact on livestock production. A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed a significant difference in FMD annual prevalence between cattle age groups (p < 0.001) and was the highest in animals > 4 years (median score of 32.5, range, 10–50). FMD had the highest impact on milk production, but based on veterinary costs (treatment costs), it was ranked second to CBPP.

"handle:10568/89843";"Survey to assess farmers’ economic perceptions, preferences and decision-making criteria relating to climate-smart soil protection & rehabilitation in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India and Kenya";"";"Key findings 
This document reports on a study to assess farmers’ economic perceptions, preferences and decision-making criteria relating climate-smart soil protection and rehabilitation (CSS) measures in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India and Kenya. Specifically, it aims to answer the question: what do farmers perceive as the key costs, benefits, barriers and enabling conditions that influence their uptake (or rejection) of different land management practices? The study applies the Evaluating Land Management Options (ELMO) tool, a participatory method that has been developed by CIAT to investigate farmers’ own perceptions and explanations of the advantages, disadvantages and trade-offs associated with different land management choices as they relate to their needs, aspirations, opportunities and constraints. 
The study is able to highlight farmers’ preferences for different CSS measures in the five study sites, as well as to identify the main inputs, outcomes, barriers and enabling conditions that influence their uptake (or rejection) of different land management practices. While there remain key differences between (and within) the study sites, a number of common lessons emerge which relate to the assessment and design of CSS measures. 
One is the need to take account of farmers’ constraints and limitations as concerns their ability to access the cash, labour and technical knowhow that are required to implement new land management practices. Even when a land management technique may be perceived to be of great interest and high potential benefit, many farmers are simply not in a position to allocate the extra inputs that are required to implement it. The other is to recognise that most farmers do not merely strive to achieve one outcome or maximise a single stream of benefits when they make land management choices. Rather, it is the array of values, and the interactions between them, that matter and shape their preferences. The most desirable and viable land management alternatives are seen to be those which not only increase the flow of physical products (for example cash, food and other items), but also enhance livelihood diversity and security (such as filling critical food and cash gaps over the course of the year), at the same time as helping to secure longer-term improvements in the production base (most importantly soil fertility and moisture). 
The study findings serve to underline the fact that the most preferred land management are not necessarily those that yield the highest production gains, generate the greatest income, or entail the lowest costs (the characteristics that would traditionally be deemed important when land management interventions are designed). The metrics that are used to determine the desirability and viability of different land management options, measure their desired effects, and weigh up their advantages and disadvantages do not just concern cash costs and benefits or physical inputs and outputs, but encompass a wide array of monetary and non-monetary factors (such as the type and diversity of benefits generated and costs incurred, their timing, certainty, risk and relative ease of delivery). Unless these broader needs, constraints and preferences are identified, and addressed in the land management ‘solutions’ that are presented to farmers, CSS measures are unlikely to be acceptable, effective or sustainable in practice.";"Emerton, Lucy

"handle:10568/80938";"Sustainable recommendation domains for scaling agricultural technologies in Tanzania";"";"Low adoption of sustainable intensification technologies hinders achievement of their potential impacts on increasing agricultural productivity. Proper targeting of locations to scale-out particular technologies is a key determinant of the rate of adoption. Targeting locations with similar biophysical and socio-economic characteristics significantly increases the probability of adoption. Areas with similar biophysical and socio-economic characteristics are referred to as recommendation domains (RDs). This study used geospatial analysis to delineate sustainable recommendation domains (SRDs) for scaling improved crop varieties and good agronomic practices in Tanzania. The study uses K-means clustering to identify relatively similar clusters from grid raster’s representing biophysical and socio-economic environments. Critical ecosystems are masked-out from the clusters to generate the SRDs. The potential impacts of scaling technologies in the generated SRDs were assessed and a spatial targeting index developed. Results identify 20 SRDs and the bio-socio-economic gradients that delineate them. This study proposes an Impact Based Spatial Targeting Index (IBSTI) as an objective tool for priority setting when scaling agricultural technologies. IBSTI identified priority areas within each SRD that should be targeted to maximize potential impacts of a scaling intervention. The data-driven clustering method is recommended for regions with limited technology trials. Results demonstrate the potential of geospatial tools in generating evidence-based policies on scaling of sustainable intensification technologies.";"Muthoni, Francis K.

"handle:10568/81199";"El manejo de plantas silvestres alimenticias en escenarios de deforestación, ilustrado por una comunidad mestiza de la Amazonía Peruana";"";"Las plantas silvestres alimenticias son un componente esencial de la dieta de la población rural en distintas partes del mundo, teniendo un rol importante en su seguridad alimentaria y diversidad nutricional. Dada la alarmante disminución de los bosques, la colecta de estas especies ocurre cada vez más en ecosistemas antropogénicos, donde las comunidades activamente las manejan para asegurar su disponibilidad y acceso. Este es ciertamente el caso de Ucayali, que es una de las regiones de la Amazonía Peruana con mayores tasas de deforestación, donde las poblaciones locales están en una constante adaptación frente a la pérdida de biodiversidad. Esta presentación analiza los resultados de un estudio realizado en una comunidad mestiza de Ucayali, cuya área boscosa ha disminuido considerablemente en las últimas décadas. Se desarrollaron grupos focales para documentar las características principales, colecta y formas de manejo de las plantas silvestres alimenticias, así como los roles de género asociados. De un total de treinta especies documentadas, el 70% se colecta de la chacra (campo agrícola), el 57% del monte (bosque) y el 43% de la huerta. Contrario a lo documentado por otros estudios, más del 40% de las plantas son colectadas exclusivamente por hombres. De un total de veinte especies manejadas, 90% han sido trasplantadas ex situ, 35% son desmalezadas, 20% fertilizadas, mientras que tres especies son regadas, otras tres son podadas y una es protegida. 
La división de las prácticas de manejo refleja la división de género de los espacios productivos del hogar. El estudio concluye que los procesos de manejo y domesticación de recursos genéticos son muy importantes para la seguridad alimentaria de familias rurales y conservación de recursos clave frente a escenarios de deforestación y pérdida de biodiversidad.";"Cruz-García, Gisella S.

"handle:10568/96114";"Water user associations: a review of approaches and alternative management options for Sub-Saharan Africa";"";"Building on existing literature and the analysis of a portfolio of development projects (past and under implementation), this paper reviews the evolution of water user associations (WUAs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), reflecting on the conceptualization of how they operate, and the promised outcomes related to irrigation development, and the efficient and effective delivery of irrigation services. It also moves one step further from existing studies on WUAs, postulating that additional reflection is needed to understand the limitations of WUAs and proposes alternative, viable and context-based adapted models. This need is particularly strong in SSA where irrigation is incipient, and governments and donors are still consolidating their development approaches. Whereas a growing body of international literature takes into account the sociopolitical context of decentralized irrigation management, practical indication on what remains to be done to address the various limitations found in SSA stays meagre and scattered. The objective of this paper is not to challenge the myth of WUAs but to learn how to better deliver on the promised outcomes. The underlying message is that, if the SSA region is to be made water and food secure while respecting resource sustainability, community development, livelihoods and equality of resource access, the recurrent templates for WUA management and governance need to be revisited and adapted to local needs.";"Aarnoudse, E.

"handle:10568/81996";"Thailand: rapid growth driven by export markets";"";"In Thailand cassava is produced mainly for export. The Thai cassava industry was based on starch export until the 60s when West Germany began to use CSW for animal feed. As this was a by-product of starch manufacturing, shortages resulted, leading to the market for CM. Chips became the dominant export in 1964 and so did native pellets in 1969, and hard pellets in 1983. Thailand went from a minor producer of cassava in the 50s to presently the 2nd largest in the world. Data are provided on production trends, yields (av. 13-14 t/ha), production systems, production costs, and labor utilization. Mechanization has been introduced to decrease costs. Research by the Huai Pong Expt. Station in Rayong (created in 1956) emphasized soil management and fertilization for 2 decades until lack of progress in this area led to a var. improvement program. Increasing yields will be critical in the future. Processing costs have been reduced substantially. Not only has the country adjusted rapidly to changing EEC policies, but has also restructured its export markets. (CIAT)||En Tailandia la yuca se produce principalmente para exportacion. La industria yuquera tailandesa se baso en la exportacion de almidon hasta la decada de los 60 cuando Alemania Occidental comenzo a utilizar los residuos de almidon de yuca en alimentos para animales. Debido a que este era un subproducto de la fabricacion de almidon, se presento escasez, lo cual dirigio el mercado hacia la HIY. En 1964 los trozos se convirtieron en el rubro de exportacion dominante, como tambien lo fueron los pelets naturales en 1969 y los pelets duros en 1983. Tailandia paso de ser un pequeno productor de yuca en la decada de los 50 a ser actualmente el segundo productor en el mundo. Se suministran datos en tendencias de produccion, rendimientos (prom. de 13 a 14 t/ha), sistemas de produccion, costos de produccion y utilizacion de mano de obra. Para reducir los costos se introdujo la mecanizacion. La investigacion realizada por la Estacion Exptl. Huai Pong en Rayong (creada en 1956) se concentro en fertilizacion y manejo de suelos durante 2 decadas hasta que la falta de progreso en estas areas llevo a la creacion de un programa de mejoramiento var. El incremento de los rendimientos sera critico en el futuro. Los costos de procesamiento se han reducido sustancialmente. El pais no solo se ha ajustado rapidamente a las politicas cambiantes del MCE, sino que tambien ha reestructurado sus mercados de exportacion.

"handle:10568/81208";"Automated cropland mapping of continental Africa using Google Earth Engine cloud computing";"";"The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub-meter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250-m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90% for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL2014) were then used in the development of the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL2014). ACL2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95%. Based on the ACL2014, the African continent had 296 Mha of net cropland areas (260 Mha cultivated plus 36 Mha fallows) and 330 Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260 Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90.6% (236 Mha) was rainfed and just 9.4% (24 Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15% of the world’s population, but only about 6% of world’s irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95 Mha during season 1, 117 Mha during season 2, and 84 Mha continuous. About 58% of the rainfed and 39% of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (June-September). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL2003 to ACL2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1 Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1 Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250-m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results.";"Xiong, Jun

To address this knowledge gap, we identified stream water sources and flow paths in three tropical montane sub-catchments (27–36 km2) with different land use (natural forest, smallholder agriculture and commercial tea plantations) within a 1 021 km2 catchment in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya. Weekly samples were collected from stream water, precipitation and soil water for 75 weeks and analysed for stable water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) for mean transit time estimation, whereas trace element samples from stream water and potential end members were collected over a period of 55 weeks for end member mixing analysis. Stream water mean transit time was similar (~ 4 years) in the three sub-catchments, and ranged from 3.2–3.3 weeks in forest soils and 4.5–7.9 weeks in pasture soils at 15 cm depth to 10.4–10.8 weeks in pasture soils at 50 cm depth. The contribution of springs and wetlands to stream discharge increased from 18, 1 and 48 % during low flow to 22, 51 and 65 % during high flow in the natural forest, smallholder agriculture and tea plantation sub-catchments, respectively. The dominant stream water source in the tea plantation sub-catchment was spring water (56 %), while precipitation was dominant in the smallholder agriculture (59 %) and natural forest (45 %) sub-catchments. These results confirm that catchment hydrology is strongly influenced by land use, which could have serious consequences for water-related ecosystem services, such as provision of clean water.";"Jacobs, S.R.

"handle:10568/92053";"A watershed approach to managing rainfed agriculture in the semiarid region of southern Mali: Integrated research on water and land use";"";"Soil and water conservation (SWC) practices like that of erosion control and soil fertility measures were commonly practiced in the semiarid region of southern Mali since the 1980s. The SWC practices were mainly meant to increase water availability in the subsurface, reduce farm water runoff and gully formation and improve nutrient content of the soil, thereby increasing crop yield. Despite such efforts to promote at scale SWC practices, the landscape of southern Mali is still affected by high rates of runoff and soil erosion and low crop yield in farmers’ fields. Data are lacking on previous beneficial SWC practices that could be adapted for wider application. In this paper, a watershed approach to managing rainfed agriculture is presented to show potential benefits of SWC practices at field and watershed scales. The approach included (1) community participation in establishing and monitoring new sets of hydro-meteorological monitoring stations and field experiments; (2) studying the dynamics and consumptive water uses of different land uses over time; and (3) evaluating the biophysical and economic advantages of SWC practices implemented in the watershed. Results showed that over a period of 34 years (1980–2014) cropping area and consumptive water uses of crops (sorghum and cotton) increased at the expenses of natural vegetation. However, the yield of these crops remained low, indicating that soil fertility management and soil moisture were insufficient. In such cases, implementation of more SWC practices can help provide the additional soil moisture required.";"Zemadim, Berhanu

"handle:10568/98540";"Model-based estimation of land subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal";"";"This study is the first to assess land subsidence in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Land subsidence simulations were based on a fully calibrated groundwater (GW) flow model developed using a coupled surface–subsurface modelling system. Subsidence is predicted to occur as a result of deep aquifer compaction due to excessive GW abstraction. The north and north-east areas at the periphery of the GW basin are hotspots for this subsidence. The estimated subsidence is most sensitive to changes in land cover within the recharge areas. The model shows the Melamchi water supply project assists in the control of subsidence to some extent. In the absence of land subsidence measurements, this paper highlights the location and the potential levels of the subsidence hazard which will be useful for hazard prevention management. Additionally, this work provides a basis to design field investigations, monitoring networks for land subsidence and upgrading the present GW monitoring network. Although the study has presented a preliminary analysis, a more comprehensive model inclusive of clay subsidence is required to address the subsidence vulnerability of the central densely populated core of the valley, which reflects the need for a comprehensive database of the hydrogeology in the valley.";"Shrestha, P.

"handle:10568/100221";"Soil carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from forests and other land use types in an African tropical montane region";"";"In the last 40 years, large areas of the Mau forest, the largest contiguous tropical montane forest in East Africa, have been cleared for agriculture. To date, there are no empirical data on how this land use change affects carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from soil respiration and soil methane (CH4) fluxes. This study reports measured annual soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the native Mau forest and previously forested lands converted to smallholder grazing land, smallholder and commercial tea plantations and eucalyptus plan- tations. Fluxes were measured weekly from August 2015 to August 2016 using the static chamber method. Grazing lands had the highest (p = 0.028) cumulative respiratory CO2 fluxes (25.6 ± 2.9 Mg CO2–C ha-1 year-1), whereas lowest fluxes were observed in commercial tea plantations (5.6 ± 0.5 Mg CO2–C ha-1 year-1). Soil respiratory CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil pH, but negatively correlated with soil C:N ratio. Annual soil fluxes were explained by soil pH, bulk density and the interaction between soil pH and C:N ratio. Most soils were sinks for atmospheric CH4 across all land use types. Methane uptake was highest for native forest sites (- 3.08 ± 0.35 to - 5.84 ± 0.61 kg CH4–C ha-1 year-1) and for eucalyptus plantations (- 3.43 ± 0.19 kg CH4–C ha-1 year-1). Uptake decreased significantly with increasing land use intensity (smallholder tea plantations: - 1.42 ± 0.09 kg CH4–C ha-1 year-1, commercial tea plantations: - 1.44 ± 0.29 kg CH4–C ha-1 year-1). Soils of smallholder grazing lands had the lowest CH4 uptake rates (- 0.36 ± 0.25 kg CH4–C ha-1 year-1). Annual CH4 uptake was negatively correlated with mean annual soil water-filled pore space (p \ 0.01) and bulk density (p = 0.003) and decreased with increasing soil inorganic NH4? concentrations (p = 0.03). Annual soil CH4 can be explained by mainly soil water content and bulk density and these factors are related to gas diffusion. Our study shows that converting tropical montane forests to managed land use types affects soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Specifically, the CH4 sink strength in managed land use types of these montane tropical soils was reduced to less than half of the sink strength in the native forest. Soil respiratory CO2 fluxes were also altered by land use with grazing lands emitting 3–4 times more CO2 than the other land use types.";"Wanyama, Ibrahim

A network of low-lying lands acts as natural retention and storage that captures floodwater, minimizing damage. An increase in the flood frequency has been observed in recent years. It is commonly perceived that this increase is caused by a rise in the frequency and severity of ‘very wet’ precipitation events. We conclude that land-use changes may have played a larger role in generating floods.";"Eriyagama, Nishadi

"handle:10568/97655";"Gender dimensions of community-based groundwater governance in Ethiopia: using citizen science as an entry point";"";"Understanding the gender dimensions of community-based groundwater governance is important because men and women differ in their need for and having access to groundwater, and their participation in the development, management and monitoring of the resource. The leading role played by women in obtaining and safeguarding water is not usually reflected in the institutional arrangements for water management. Addressing this gender inequality could lead to the equal participation of men and women in monitoring and sustainable management of groundwater, and women’s empowerment. This paper explores gender aspects of community-based groundwater governance in Dangeshta and Farawocha kebeles in Dangila and Boloso Bombe woredas, respectively, in Ethiopia. The findings suggest that women place a high value on groundwater and could be motivated to play a greater role in governance of the resource. However, the constraints they face in participating in groundwater development and management, particularly exclusion from decision-making, suggest that their effective participation and leadership could be significantly curtailed without specific interventions. Indeed, this is reflected in women’s willingness to participate in groundwater monitoring, as well as men’s reluctance to allow their wives to participate. This is in contrast to a high number of men willing to participate. Citizen science as an entry point for community-based groundwater governance relies on (i) the active involvement of myriad actors (including men and women citizens) whose actions interact with the hydrological processes; and (ii) volunteer interest (i.e., willingness to participate). A gender-sensitive approach to programs, gender awareness training, and partnerships with organizations working for women’s empowerment, natural resource management and adult literacy are recommended to support a citizen science approach to groundwater monitoring.";"Nigussie, Likimyelesh

Ensuring that they have opportunities—equal to those of men—to participate in transforming agriculture is a prerequisite for sustainable intensification. Increased gender equity in agriculture is both a practical and a social justice issue: practical because women are responsible for much of the production by smallholders; and social justice because in many cases they currently do not have rights over land and water resources, nor full access to markets, and often they do not even control the crops they produce. Strategies to promote gender equity must be tailored carefully to the social and economic context.";"CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems";"CGIAR";"International Water Management Institute;CGIAR";"CGIAR";"2018-12-31";"en";"land;land access;land management;natural resources management;land use;water management";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/97650";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"12";"";"101132"

It also includes growth and yield data from published sources and collected from sites under community–company partnerships in South Kalimantan and Riau provinces. This manual is one of five manuals that guide smallholder tree planting of five selected tree species in Indonesia. The other four species are: Aleurites moluccana (L.) Willd.; Anthocephalus cadamba Miq.; Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) Nielsen; and Swietenia macrophylla King. Smallholders in Indonesia have planted trees on private or community land for a long time. Various actors have encouraged this activity to improve local livelihoods, environmental sustainability and industrial wood supply. These efforts have been generally successful, but they are often undertaken without technical assistance. Since farmers often lack technical capacity and management know-how, the quality and quantity of products may not be optimal. Productivity of smallholder plantations can be improved by enhancing smallholders’ management knowledge and skills, including species selection based on site matching, silvicultural management to maximise product quality, and pest and disease management.";"Krisnawati, H.

"handle:10568/20811";"Chopping for chips: An analysis of wood flows from smallholder plantations in Vietnam";"";"This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the wood flows from smallholder plantations to industrial buyers in the Binh Dinh and Phu Tho provinces of Vietnam. It describes the actors involved in the market chains, their respective roles, the value added to the wood in the market chain and the distribution of costs and benefits. Various differences between the two provinces exist. In Binh Dinh, wood flows are relatively direct and the market price information is transparent. There are various end-buyers but most are buying bark-clean logs. The division of labour is clear among actors. Plantation wood brings substantial income for the tree growers, yet there is great potential to improve their income through better marketing. In the Phu Tho province, the situation is more complex with various levels of intermediaries. The most striking difference is that most actors have poor access to price information, even in the wholesale market. Markets are more varied with four main types of wood; the most prominent are woodchips and bark-clean logs. The end-buyer market of these products is dominated by Bai Bang Paper Mill because it is located close to the tree growers. At site level, the division of labour is not as clear as in Binh Dinh. The farm gate price in Phu Tho is much lower than the price in Binh Dinh, thus tree growers in Phu Tho have a lower income from wood sales. Plantation wood plays an important part in local livelihoods, but there is still room for improvement.";"Nguyen Quang Tan";"";"Center for International Forestry Research";"CGIAR";"2011-12-31";"en";"forestry";"Forest Tenure";"VNM";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/20811";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"21638"

"handle:10568/81982";"Farmer participatory research in soil management in Indonesia";"";"Soil degradation, both due to soil erosion and nutrient removal, is a major problem in cassava fields. Most of the existing management technologies that have been developed have had little success in adoption. Some of the reasons are that the technology developed is technically oriented, based on experiment station research with very little farmer involvement.
Research on ""Farmer's participation in developing management technologies for cassavabased cropping systems"" was carried out in farmers' fields in Wates and Dampit subdistricts of Blitar and Malang districts of East Java, respectively. The research is planned for five years, with the first year activities of : (a) Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) and diagnostic surveys for identification of the problems encountered by cassava farmers, and (b) establishment of demonstration plots to test and to show to farmers the management technologies that have been identified and selected by the collaborating farmers. Activities planned for the second and following years include the testing of the most attractive technology options on farmers' fields by farmers themselves.
 In general, most farmers had already been aware of the problem of soil degradation in their fields, and had tried some management technologies for overcoming this problem. However, since the technology is too complicated, laborious and costly, they were unwilling to adopt. In fact, most farmers were very keen to adopt any attractive new technology, if the technology is simple, does not imply a lot of extra costs, and is easy to be adopted. This was indicated by the number of farmers willing to participate in the second year to test some technologies in their own fields.";"Utomo, W.H.

"handle:10568/81981";"Farmer participatory research in cassava soil management and varietal dissemination in Vietnam";"";"Farmer Participatory Research (FPR) in Vietnam has been carried out since 1994 in collaboration with CIAT, with the objective of improving the adoption of soil conservation practices in cassava fields. Two villages in Pho Yen district, Bac Thai province; one in Thanh Hoa district, Vinh Phu province; and one in Luong Son district of Hoa Binh province were selected as pilot sites for implementing the FPR methodology.
In 1994: By using RRA and PRA methods in conducting diagnostic surveys, some main limiting factors in cassava production were identified, such as lack of suitable planting methods for soil erosion control and lack of knowledge about balanced fertilizer application and about high yielding varieties. Therefore, demonstration plot with 17 treatments on different ways to improve soil fertility and methods to control soil erosion, were established at the Agro-forestry College in Thai Ngyen, Bac Thai.
Farmers' field days were held to show the demonstration plots to farmers and extensionists from two of the selected districts in mid Nov, 1994. Based on the results and discussion, seven treatments were identified by farmers as promising treatments for 1995. Farmers also discussed how to arrange these in simple FPR trials in their own fields.
In 1995: Twenty five farmers of two villages in Pho Yen and ten farmers in Thanh Hoa districts participated in the project by conducting research on their own fields. At time of harvest, a farmers field day was held in both districts in mid Nov, 1995. Fanners and researchers joined in the harvest and in the discussion of the results. Some best treatments were identified. The treatments of cassava intercropped with peanut and contour hedgerows of vetiver grass, combined with balanced NPK application, was considered as the most promising practice at both pilot sites, as soil erosion losses were reduced by 20-40% compared to the check plot of cassava grown in monoculture and without hedgerows. In Pho Yen district, cassava yields in this treatment were about the same as the check plot, but net income increased 9-36%. In Thanh Hoa, cassava yields increased about 9% compared to the check plot, while net income increased by 23%. In this location cassava intercropped with peanut increased net income from 131 to 273% over cassava monoculture. Farmers who tested new promising clones considered KM60 and CM4995-7 as the most suitable for their conditions; these clones increased yields from 1 .7 to 4. 1 t/ha over the check variety Vinh Phu.
These initial results are encouraging more and more farmers to participate in the FPR trials. The number of farmers participating in 1996 increased and some of them can conduct the trials now by themselves.";"Nguyen The Dang

However, scarce and insufficient water or irregular rainfall frequently puts farmers at risk of losing their crops. Climate change is making already variable rainfall less reliable. Yet all kinds of water users—farmers, fishers, livestock herders, domestic users, city dwellers, emerging industries–and ecosystems depend on access to water of the right quality, in the right quantity, and at the right time.

During the CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food’s second phase of research in the Volta River basin (2010-2013), one research project worked directly with a local water committee in one of the seven sub- basins of the Bougouriba watershed in the southwestern part of the country.

Results from the latter demonstrated major gains in yield among colored materials and a very high proportion of lines resistant to BCMV. Many lines demonstrated multiple-disease resistance. In 1978, 150 International Bean Yield and Adaptation nurseries (88 color, 62 black) were distributed to 34 countries. Rust, BGMV and BCMV nurseries were also distributed. Other major advances include initiation of a breeding program for climbing cv. to be grown in association with maize, establishment of temp conditions likely to limit N fixation and identification of cv. tolerant to low soil P. Microregions of bean production in L.A. were identified and an agroclimatology survey initiated. On-farm trials showed that low-cost cultural practices could increase yields 50 percent.

"handle:10568/92682";"Cassava production and processing in the Democratic Republic of Congo: COSCA working paper, No 22";"";"The importance of cassava relative to other crops in the cropping system was almost total; cassava was present in 70% of arable fields; maize and beans or peas were each present in 13% of arable fields and all other crops were present in 4%. Cassava was produced mostly for sale, yet it was not as important around market centers as in remote areas because imported rice and wheat products were easily accessible. Cassava land area was not expanding in many of the villages visited because of low-level processing technologies, difficult market access conditions, and because consumers had easy access to imported cereals in the market centers. There were virtually no bred cassava varieties at the farm level. Farmers were selecting genotypes with a large canopy among local landraces because of weed problems and because cassava leaves were widely harvested for human consumption as vegetables. Farmers in high population density areas were selecting early bulking genotypes while others were selecting genotypes which had good in ground storage qualities in the vast areas where fallow rotation was practiced. The available landraces had low genetic potential for root yield as most of them were susceptible to cassava plant pests/diseases especially African cassava mosaic disease. The majority of the cassava producers relied mainly on crop rotation, fallow management, and cultivar selection from among the available landraces for the control of cassava mealybug, cassava green mite, African cassava mosaic disease, and cassava bacterial blight. Although population pressure on land was low in comparison with other countries studied, the mean root yield was below the average for the other countries. The factors which were driving the yield in some of the other countries were lacking. Intensified land-use practices were not adopted because population pressure on land was low. Purchased inputs including high-yielding varieties were not used because access to market was poor for most places while easy access to imported rice and wheat products discouraged farmers around the market centers from investing in the use of the purchased inputs. Cassava was widely processed into two major products, chikwangwe, a convenient food product which was available in ready-to-serve form, and cossette which required further processing and elaborate cooking at home. Chikwangwe was made more in remote areas than in commercial areas. Market demand was limited by easy access to imported rice and wheat for bread. Labor-saving technologies were not adopted in making these products; cassava processing was therefore manual and very laborious. The consequence was that cassava processing did not stimulate expanded cassava production in the Democratic Republic of Congo as it did in West Africa.";"Nweke, F.

"handle:10568/92444";"State spaces of resistance: industrial tree plantations and the struggle for land in Laos";"";"Land grabbing has transformed rural environments across the global South, generating resistance or political reactions “from below”. In authoritarian countries like Laos, where resource investments are coercively developed and insulated from political dissent, resistance appears absent at first glance. Yet, it is occurring under the radar, largely outside transnational activist networks. In this article, we examine how resistance can protect access to rural lands in contexts where it is heavily repressed. Resistance here occurs with, rather than against the state by foregrounding the contradictions of land use and ownership within state spaces, such as competing goals of large-scale industrial plantations versus smallholder agriculture and national forest conservation. Such contradictions are engaged by using historical, place-based political connections to exploit the scalar frictions of a fragmented state and occupying plantation clearance sites to highlight contested lands in situ. Nonetheless, such strategies remain spatially and socially uneven amongst the Lao peasantry.";"Miles, K.-L.

Comparing the suitability maps with available land use data showed that on average 9% (96103ha) of Ethiopian irrigated and 18% (3739103ha) of rainfed land would be suitable for solar PV pump irrigation. Furthermore, small solar PV pumps could be an alternative water lifting technology for 11% of the current and future small motorized fuel hydro-carbon pumps on smallholder farms (2166103ha). Depending on the technical pump capacity, between 155103ha and 204103ha of land would be suitable for solar PV pumps and provide smallholder farmers with the option to either pump from small reservoirs or shallow groundwater. With the ongoing interest in development for smallholder irrigation, the application of this model will help to upscale solar PV pumps for smallholder farmers in SSA as a climate smart technology in an integrated manner.";"Schmitter, Petra

"handle:10568/92442";"Nutrient management in livestock systems in West Africa Sahel with emphasis on feed and grazing management";"";"Feed and grazing management affect both the quantity and quality of animal manure and consequently nutrient cycling in the mixed crop-livestock systems in West Africa Sahel. Dietary measures can significantly influence the composition of manure and hence it’s agricultural value. High nutrient feed will generally result in higher nutrient content of the manure whereas a decline in feed quality will generally lead to increase in the indigestible fractions in the feeds. Apart from feed and feeding practices, grazing management also affects the amount and nutrient contents of manure that can be recycled to the cropland. When animals are used to deposit manure in the crop field, conflicts often arise between the need for animals to graze long enough for adequate feed intake and the need to collect manure. This paper examines the effects of feed and grazing management on livestock-mediated nutrient transfers in mixed crop-livestock systems in West Africa Sahel. Results from grazing trials in Niger showed that nitrogen voided in faeces follow the trend of nitrogen contents in the feed for grazing cattle. Animals that had additional grazing time in the night consistently had higher forage intake and consequently, higher average daily gain than those that grazed only during the day in all seasons. However, additional grazing at night reduced the amount of manure that could be collected for crop fields unless the grazing location is crop field. It is therefore necessary to optimize the animals’ time for foraging to maintain or increase livestock output in terms of meat and/or milk, and for manuring to sustain soil fertility and hence crop production.";"Ayantunde, Augustine A.

This comparative study between six watershed programs shows that this approach increases farmers’ food security and incomes (around 50% on average), as well as their resilience to drought and other climate shocks. However, the study also confirms that the nature and scale of impact can vary significantly between watershed programs. The success of watershed management depends on multiple factors from the hydrological profile of the watershed to the local social and economic environment. Tailoring watershed interventions to the local context, associating conservation and livelihoods activities, and providing further financial and technical support to watershed committees are among the recommendations of this paper.";"Gebregziabher, Gebrehaweria

As much as 500 million out of two billion ha of degraded land, mainly in developing countries, have restoration potential, offering an immediate target for restoration and rehabilitation initiatives.1 In the past, piecemeal approaches to achieving sustainable land management have had limited impact. To achieve the ambitious goals of alleviating poverty, securing food and water supplies, and protecting the natural resource base, we need to recognize the inter-connectedness of the factors driving land degradation, so that solutions can be taken to scale, transforming management practices for millions of land users. An analysis of the critical barriers and incentives to achieve scaling up suggests that the most appropriate options should be selected through the involvement of stakeholders at all levels, from local to national and international. New incentives for land managers as well as the public and private sectors are required to achieve a land degradation-neutral world.";"Thomas, Richard J.

It describes the origins of the concept and the methodological developments, its operationalization through applied research, and some lessons learned over the two decades of research. This report further highlights how a focus on agricultural water productivity has brought greater attention to critical water scarcity issues, and the role of agricultural water management in supporting broader development objectives such as increasing agricultural production, reducing agricultural water use, raising farm-level incomes, and alleviating poverty and inequity. Yet, reliance on a single-factor productivity metric, such as agricultural water productivity defined as “crop per drop,” in multi-factor and multi-output production processes can mask the complexity of agricultural systems as well as the trade-offs required to achieve desired outcomes. The findings from this retrospective underscore the limitations of single-factor productivity metrics while also highlighting opportunities to support more comprehensive approaches to address water scarcity concerns and, ultimately, achieve the broader development objectives.";"Giordano, Meredith A.

A recent mode of farming is the ‘joint venture’, in which smallholders hand over land and share in the net profits, while a strategic partner manages the cultivation with own inputs and equipment, and markets the output. With a focus on the 13 sub-schemes of the Flag Boshielo irrigation scheme in the former homeland of Lebowa (current Limpopo Province), the report analyzes the emergence of six joint ventures - the collapse of three and the troubled continuation of the other three. For the government’s support to joint ventures as one of the options of the revitalization of smallholder irrigation schemes in former homelands, it is recommended to ensure there is a robust bilateral contract between smallholders and the strategic partner, to strengthen land tenure arrangements, and to diversify irrigation technologies for women and men smallholders.";"Koppen, Barbara C.M. van

Small-scale irrigators tend to be younger, male and better-off. Women and resource-poor farmers – the majority of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa– are disadvantaged and often excluded from the numerous benefits to be gained from irrigation. Equity in access to water management technologies and practices is constrained by numerous factors, including high investment costs, absence of financial services, poor market integration, inadequate information services, and labour constraints. Lack of institutions for collective management of natural resources, such as water, further restricts access for resource-poor farmers, increasing inequity. In the absence of sustainable natural resources management approaches to agricultural intensification, this situation may become more acute as natural resources become increasingly valuable, and therefore contested. Realising the full potential of farmer-led irrigation requires contextualised policies, institutions and practices to improve equity, markets and sustainability and help ensure that sector growth is inclusive and beneficial.";"Lefore, N.

"handle:10568/81470";"Poor livestock keepers: ecosystem–poverty–health interactions";"";"Humans have never been healthier, wealthier or more numerous. Yet, present success may be at the cost of future prosperity and in some places, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, poverty persists. Livestock keepers, especially pastoralists, are over-represented among the poor. Poverty has been mainly attributed to a lack of access, whether to goods, education or enabling institutions. More recent insights suggest ecosystems may influence poverty and the self-reinforcing mechanisms that constitute poverty traps in more subtle ways. The plausibility of zoonoses as poverty traps is strengthened by landmark studies on disease burden in recent years. While in theory, endemic zoonoses are best controlled in the animal host, in practice, communities are often left to manage disease themselves, with the focus on treatment rather than prevention. We illustrate this with results from a survey on health costs in a pastoral ecosystem. Epidemic zoonoses are more likely to elicit official responses, but these can have unintended consequences that deepen poverty traps. In this context, a systems understanding of disease control can lead to more effective and pro-poor disease management. We illustrate this with an example of how a system dynamics model can help optimize responses to Rift Valley fever outbreaks in Kenya by giving decision makers real-time access to the costs of the delay in vaccinating. In conclusion, a broader, more ecological understanding of poverty and of the appropriate responses to the diseases of poverty can contribute to improved livelihoods for livestock keepers in Africa.

"handle:10568/99486";"Milk handling practices and consumption behavior among Borana pastoralists in southern Ethiopia";"";"Background
Safety and wholesomeness of milk intended for human consumption are influenced by various interlinked factors. However, information on what these factors are, especially in the pastoral traditional communities of Ethiopia, is largely lacking. The objective of this study is to assess the hygienic milk production, processing and consumption practices, and behaviors of Borana pastoralists.

Methods
The study used qualitative participatory research methods. Individual semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, informal discussions, and observations were carried out on (1) milk handling practices, (2) perceptions of quality and safety of milk, including perceived criteria for good milk, (3) awareness of milk-borne diseases, and (4) perception towards milk boiling practices. The interviews and discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by identifying themes.

Results
Some risky behaviors related to milk handling and consumption were identified. These include unhygienic conditions in handling milk and milk products, consumption behaviors such as consuming raw milk purchased from markets, and children directly consuming milk from the udder of animals (e.g., goats). There was a very strong reluctance to boil milk before consumption mainly because of the misconception that nutrients in the milk are destroyed when milk is boiled and “boiled milk is dead”. On the other hand, potential risk mitigation practices were identified such as smoking of milk containers (which may help reduce microbial growth), processing milk through fermentation, consuming milk in boiled tea, and a recent trend towards boiling milk for babies. However, the latter was not motivated by concern over microbial hazards but the belief that raw milk could form curds in children’s stomach which might then suffocate them.

Conclusion
The findings highlight the need to promote hygienic handling practices of milk and closely engage with local communities to improve their understanding of milk safety to facilitate change in practices. Educating pastoralists on good milk production practices should be given priority. One of the ways to do this could be by strengthening the integration of milk hygiene in research and development programs as an entry point for behavioral change towards the safe handling and consumption of milk and milk products.";"Amenu, K.

This article presents river basin planning as a function of power and contested arena of power struggles, where state actors create, sustain, and reproduce their bureaucratic power through the overall shaping of (imagined) bureaucratic territory. It argues that river basin planning is not an antidote to current ‘dysfunction’ in water resources management, rooted in overlapping jurisdictions, fragmented decision making, and bureaucratic competitions between various government agencies. On the contrary, it illustrates how river basin planning becomes a new ‘territorial frontier’, created and depicted by different government agencies as their envisioned operational boundary and as a means to sustain and increase their bureaucratic power and sectoral decision-making authority, amidst ongoing processes of federalism in Nepal.";"Suhardiman, Diana

"handle:10568/80914";"Mapping soil erosion hotspots and assessing the potential impacts of land management practices in the highlands of Ethiopia";"";"An enormous effort is underway in Ethiopia to address soil erosion and restore overall land productivity. Modelling and participatory approaches can be used to delineate erosion hotspots, plan site- and context-specific interventions and assess their impacts. In this study, we employed a modelling interface developed based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation adjusted by the sediment delivery ratio to map the spatial distribution of net soil loss and identify priority areas of intervention. Using the modelling interface, we also simulated the potential impacts of different soil and water conservation measures in reducing net soil loss. Model predictions showed that net soil loss in the study area ranges between 0.4 and 88 t ha− 1 yr− 1 with an average of 12 t ha− 1 yr− 1. The dominant soil erosion hotspots were associated with steep slopes, gullies, communal grazing and cultivated areas. The average soil loss observed in this study is higher than the tolerable soil loss rate estimated for the highland of Ethiopia. The scenario analysis results showed that targeting hotspot areas where soil loss exceeds 10 t ha− 1 yr− 1 could reduce net soil loss to the tolerable limit (< 2 t ha− 1 yr− 1). The spatial distribution of soil loss and the sediment yield reduction potential of different options provided essential information to guide prioritization and targeting. In addition, the results can help promoting awareness within the local community of the severity of the soil erosion problem and the potential of management interventions. Future work should include cost-benefit and tradeoff analyses of the various management options for achieving a given level of erosion reduction.";"Tamene, Lulseged

development and climate responsiveness. It aims to
achieve food security and broader development goals
under a changing climate and increasing food demand.
CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance
resilience, and reduce/remove greenhouse gases (GHGs),
and require planning to address tradeoffs and synergies
between these three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and
mitigation [1]. The priorities of different countries and
stakeholders are reflected to achieve more efficient, effective,
and equitable food systems that address challenges in
environmental, social, and economic dimensions across
productive landscapes. While the concept is new, and still
evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA already
exist worldwide and are used by farmers to cope with
various production risks [2]. Mainstreaming CSA requires
critical stocktaking of ongoing and promising practices for
the future, and of institutional and financial enablers for
CSA adoption. This country profile provides a snapshot of
a developing baseline created to initiate discussion, both
within countries and globally, about entry points for investing
in CSA at scale.";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture

Porter’s value chain model is used to characterize the innovations introduced by the LDB dairy in its milk inbound logistics and supplier relationships. A socioeconomic food security index and qualitative data are used to assess the dairy’s supply chain’s contribution to strengthen smallholder households’ livelihoods. Data for this research were obtained through individual surveys, focus groups and in-depth interviews of LDB managers and milk suppliers. Results show that milk income contributes significantly to household food security. Suppliers who stabilize their dairy income between rainy and dry seasons, diversify income sources and have larger herds are more likely to remain food secure. The LDB innovations contribute by helping herders access biophysical and economic resources, leading to better livestock feed and household food security.";"Wane, A.

The project seeks to understand the different modes and outcomes of water governance in selected polders and the role that communities play in such governance. Governance structures at this local level are challenged by high rates of poverty, dense human populations, highly variable fresh water availability, all coalescing into intense competition for water and land resources by a range of users. Facilitating efficient, productive, equitable and sustainable access to these resources thus needs to be a key orientation of these governance systems. This review of past experiences and the current status of Water Management Organizations (WMOs) in Bangladesh are intended to contribute to the context and process of understanding the different governance mechanisms that are in place to manage these conflicts and their comparative advantages and disadvantages.";"Silva, Sanjiv de";"";"International Water Management Institute";"CGIAR";"2012-04-30";"en";"farming systems;water management";"";"BGD";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/35137";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"36381"

governing coastal polders in Bangladesh and the role of local communities in their management. This is done through three thematically divided sections. The first section is a historical analysis of the evolution of policies and projects on community participation in the water sector in Coastal Bangladesh. The second section is an organizational comparison of the two main implementing agencies, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The third section look at BWDB and LGED’s experience of community based management and WMOs through the Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (SSWRDSP), and the Integrated Planning for Sustainable Water Management (IPSWAM).

"handle:10568/91316";"Linking crop structure, throughfall, soil surface conditions, runoff and soil detachment: 10 land uses analyzed in northern Laos";"";"In Montane Southeast Asia, deforestation and unsuitable combinations of crops and agricultural practices degrade soils at an unprecedented rate. Typically, smallholder farmers gain income from “available” land by replacing fallow or secondary forest by perennial crops. We aimed to understand how these practices increase or reduce soil erosion. Ten land uses were monitored in Northern Laos during the 2015 monsoon, using local farmers' fields. Experiments included plots of the conventional system (food crops and fallow), and land uses corresponding to new market opportunities (e.g. commercial tree plantations). Land uses were characterized by measuring plant cover and plant mean height per vegetation layer. Recorded meteorological variables included rainfall intensity, throughfall amount, throughfall kinetic energy (TKE), and raindrop size. Runoff coefficient, soil loss, and the percentage areas of soil surface types (free aggregates and gravel; crusts; macro-faunal, vegetal and pedestal features; plant litter) were derived from observations and measurements in 1-m2 micro-plots. Relationships between these variables were explored with multiple regression analyses. Our results indicate that TKE induces soil crusting and soil loss. By reducing rainfall infiltration, crusted area enhances runoff, which removes and transports soil particles detached by splash over non-crusted areas. TKE is lower under land uses reducing the velocity of raindrops and/or preventing an increase in their size. Optimal vegetation structures combine minimum height of the lowest layer (to reduce drop velocity at ground level) and maximum coverage (to intercept the largest amount of rainfall), as exemplified by broom grass (Thysanolaena latifolia). In contrast, high canopies with large leaves will increase TKE by enlarging raindrops, as exemplified by teak trees (Tectona grandis), unless a protective understorey exists under the trees. Policies that ban the burning of multi-layered vegetation structure under tree plantations should be enforced. Shade-tolerant shrubs and grasses with potential economic return could be promoted as understorey.";"Lacombe, Guillaume

These include; small water infrastructure, drip irrigation, recovery of organic matter from waste, and treated wastewater. The design decisions relating to attribute selection, the level of attributes, alternatives and choice tasks were guided by literature, field visits, focus group discussions, expert input and an iterative process of the STATA software to generate an orthogonal main-effects CE design. The data used was generated from a random sample of 300 farm households in the Dano and Ouagadougou municipalities in Burkina Faso. Results from conditional logit, latent class logit and mixt logit models show that farmers have positive and significant preferences for drip irrigation, treated wastewater, and organic matter. However, they are WTP on average more for drip irrigation and organic matter for agricultural sustainability. In line with economic theory, the cost of an intervention reduces demand for a given intervention. These findings can provide policy makers with evidence for agricultural policy design to build farmers’ resilience in the Sahel.";"Houessionon, P.

an ambition to improve the integration of agriculture
development and climate responsiveness. It aims to
achieve food security and broader development goals
under a changing climate and increasing food demand.
CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance
resilience, and reduce/remove greenhouse gases (GHGs),
and require planning to address tradeoffs and synergies
between these three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and
mitigation [7]. The priorities of different countries and
stakeholders are reflected to achieve more efficient, effective,
and equitable food systems that address challenges in
environmental, social, and economic dimensions across
productive landscapes. While the concept is new, and still
evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA already
exist worldwide and are used by farmers to cope with
various production risks [8]. Mainstreaming CSA requires
critical stocktaking of ongoing and promising practices for
the future, and of institutional and financial enablers for
CSA adoption. This country profile provides a snapshot of
a developing baseline created to initiate discussion, both
within countries and globally, about entry points for investing
in CSA at scale.";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture

It then presents results from the pilot of the Gender in Irrigation Learning and Improvement Tool (GILIT) in locations in Malawi and Uzbekistan in 2015. Through the results of the tool, the paper looks at benefit sharing between men and women farmers: (i) access to irrigation scheme resources (including information, for example, in the design phase; land, water and other inputs); (ii) participation in scheme management; and (iii) access to scheme benefits, including access to market information, packaging and payments. The indicators for the tool were modelled after principles reflected in existing gender policies and strategies, and intended to improve performance at field level in line with national and regional goals. The paper concludes with informal and formal constraints to gender-equitable outcomes from irrigation investments identified during the pilot, and suggests how the tool can be used by various development actors to improve the benefits for women from investments in agricultural water management.";"Lefore, Nicole

In this research, a livelihood approach of HFS was used and aimed at determining the most significant livelihood assets for HFS in dryland agricultural systems. Elements of the five livelihood assets were assessed through questionnaire surveys with a random sample of 180 households, and six focus group discussions in three communities along the rural-urban continuum, in Southern Mali. The coping strategy index approach was used to evaluate household food security status. Non-parametric and parametric statistical tests were combined, as appropriate, to identify the most significant determinants of HFS status. Findings indicated that most determinant factors of HFS were the diversity of wild and cultivated food plants, and hunting (natural capital); access to clean water and irrigation (infrastructural capital); and off-farm employment (financial capital). HFS also improved along the urban-rural continuum and rural households with high natural capital seemed to be more food secure. Findings call for important investment to expand the natural capital (e.g., domestication of new crops and agricultural diversification) and infrastructural capital (irrigation facilities, clean water) of the rural households.";"N’Danikou, S.

food security and broader development goals under a changing climate and increasing food demand. CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance resilience, and reduce/remove greenhouse gases (GHGs), and require planning to address tradeoffs and synergies between these three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and mitigation. The priorities of different countries and stakeholders are reflected to achieve more efficient, effective, and equitable food systems that address challenges in environmental, social, and economic dimensions across productive landscapes. While the concept is new, and still evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA already exist worldwide and are used by farmers to cope with various production risks. Mainstreaming CSA requires critical stocktaking of ongoing and promising practices for the future, and of institutional and financial enablers for CSA adoption. This country profile provides a snapshot of a developing baseline created to initiate discussion, both within countries and globally, about entry points for investing in CSA at scale.";"Martinez Valle A

"handle:10568/99107";"Community-managed groundwater irrigation on the Vientiane Plain of Lao PDR: planning, implementation and findings from a pilot trial";"";"Laos has vast surface water resources. However, in areas located far away from surface water sources or those that are prone to surface water scarcity, groundwater is gaining recognition as a valuable source of water for agricultural development. Households in Ekxang village on the Vientiane Plain, for example, depend on rainfall for the cultivation of rice during the wet season and a wide range of vegetables and herbs in the dry season. Climate change poses a growing threat to crop production in such villages, altering wet season rainfall and making drought more common and severe. To help find a new way forward, a 2-year pilot study of groundwater irrigation was carried out in Ekxang to assess the technical performance, economic viability and effectiveness of the institutional arrangements. Participation in the pilot was quite modest due to farmers being wary of possible risks related to the costs of the new irrigation system. As farmers gained experience with the high-performance pumps and other equipment, their trust grew, and they came to have a sense of ownership over the system. The irrigation system turned out to be profitable for dry-season irrigation of cash crops. Growing rice under these conditions proved to be unprofitable. Increased profits, however, did not translate into increased popularity. In the pilot’s second year, with the subsidy removed, participation in the groundwater users group declined. Apart from the additional cost for pumping, another reason was a lack of household labor to manage the production of cash crops under groundwater irrigation. This, in turn, stemmed from the availability of other livelihood options (such as small businesses and wage labor), which compete with agriculture and may prove more appealing. Clearly, the future development of such systems will depend, not just on local hydrogeological conditions, but also on a better understanding of the social and economic factors that influence farmers’ decisions. New technologies could make a difference as well, such as solar pumps, which likely reduce farmers’ production costs. Lessons learned from this pilot study should prove valuable for helping realize the potential of groundwater irrigation in Laos.";"Clement, C.

Land and soil health surveys can improve crop modeling predictions under various climate scenarios and guide more targeted interventions.

Currently, most assessments of land and soil health do not consider the social, ecological, and biophysical constraints, or acknowledge the variations in the landscape.

The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) assesses multiple indicators at the same geo-referenced location across landscapes. It provides a biophysical baseline at landscape level and a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the processes of land degradation and the effectiveness of rehabilitation measures over time (Figure 3).

With the LDSF, vulnerable areas that may require more investment in terms of land restoration can be identified early on and priorities determined.";"Winowiecki, Leigh A.

This article examines whether the poverty profiles of smallholder farmers and the nutritional outcomes of their children have improved as a result of using spate irrigation. The study areas were in two regional states in Ethiopia. Twenty-five users each, both from traditional and modern spate irrigation schemes, and an equal number of non-users responded to a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measures of 122 children under five were measured using a hanging scale and stadiometer. The results indicated that all poverty indices were significantly lower for the spate irrigation users compared to non-users, and were even lower for modern spate compared to traditional spate systems. Our results did not show gender differences, using sex of the household head as a crude measure of gender, in poverty profiles. Stochastic dominance tests showed that the poverty comparisons between users, traditional and modern, and non-users are statistically robust. It can be concluded that the use of spate irrigation can significantly reduce poverty, and modernizing spate systems further increases its poverty-reduction impact. However, anthropometric measures indicated that use of spate irrigation did not have significant nutritional effects, suggesting the need for nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as nutrition education and awareness and multisectoral collaboration.";"Hagos, Fitsum

"handle:10568/97165";"Land Degradation Assessments Using Multiscale Hierarchical Approaches for Agroecosystem Restoration and Improved Food Security: The Case for Kenya and Burkina Faso";"";"This report provides a synthesis on land degradation assessments conducted for two countries (Kenya and
Burkina Faso) at different scales. The task mainly involved identifying hotspot areas of degradation that require priority management interventions. The approach involves modelling, stakeholder engagement and field validation.
In the report, we refer to land degradation as the persistent loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused by disturbances from which the land cannot recover unaided.
Hotspots refer to places that, if left unattended, could prove harmful, both to the environment and to those dependent on it. These areas generally require priority management interventions due to the severity of the degradation problem and its associated cost. Considering the fact that land degradation processes differ across space and over time and that there will be no ‘one-size-fitsall’ approach to assess the severity of the problem and its spatial distribution, a multiscale hierarchical approach was followed. At the national level, we used time series satellite and rainfall data to trace the spatial distribution of land degradation and identify the major drivers (human caused versus climate induced). Results from such exercise would benefit national level planning and decision making. In addition, development organizations, donors and NGOs can benefit from such results to target their interventions. At the county/province/district level, we developed an ‘index’ that can help map land degradation risks using relatively higher resolution data. Such products can be beneficial to county/district level planners as well as stakeholders whose activities are relevant to this scale. The third and more detailed level of analysis employs a spatially distributed hydrological model to map land degradation hotspots at landscape and/or farm levels and assess the impacts of land management options. Outputs from this analysis can be used by development agents, extension workers as well as local communities and farmers to facilitate targeted decision making. The above sequential steps clearly demonstrate the need for context-specific analysis that fit to local and regional conditions. In addition to the modelling and analysis results, the report provides recommendations for farmers, policy makers, decision and development agents and researchers regarding the implications of the land degradation findings towards identifying technical, policy and institutional arrangements that will promote land restoration, agroecosystem health and food security in order to meet current and future human and environmental sustainability objectives.";"Kizito, Fred

"handle:10568/97168";"Asssesing the effectiveness and impact of agricultural water management interventions: the case of small reservoirs in northern Ghana";"";"Agricultural water management, particularly management of multi-purpose small reservoirs (SRs) in drier savanna areas of the northern Ghana, is being promoted as a key solution to improve agricultural production, enhance food security and livelihoods of smallholder farm households. However, little empirical evidence exist on how effective these small water infrastructures are in terms of delivering multiple benefits and their impact on the livelihood of smallholder farmers. This study assessed the effectiveness and impact of the small reservoirs on smallholder vegetable farmers in northern Ghana. A participatory rating method using a 5-point Likert-scale was used to assess the effectiveness of SRs in delivering multiple livelihood benefits and an endogenous switching regression model was applied to assess the SRs’ impact using a primary data collected from 328 randomly sampled vegetable farmers. Results from the Likert scale analysis show that most of the SRs are either dysfunctional or underutilized and not effective in delivering multiple benefits. Results from the endogenous switching regression model show that there is only about 3% increase in the income of vegetable farmers participating in irrigated vegetable production using SRs against the counterfactual situation but this change is insignificant statistically. The current low level effectiveness and impact of SRs could be enhanced by improving their management, for example, through the provision of incentive mechanisms such as subsidies to the private sector involvement in rehabilitation, management and irrigation service provision and strengthening the capacity of existing water users associations. Furthermore, small reserviors should be recognized not only as water sources for small scale irrigation but also as providers of multiple livelihood benefits to local communities and consequently should attract due attention in public resource allocation in their rehabilitation and management/institutional capacity building.";"Acheampong, D.

"handle:10568/41896";"Dynamics and climate change mitigation potential of soil organic carbon sequestration";"";"When assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon storage and interventions to foster it should be taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014–2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9–3.9% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032–33, at that time reaching 4.3–8.9% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC.";"Sommer, Rolf

Despite their rapid diffusion, there is insufficient assessment of their potential implications for social and economic stratification (Redford and Adams 2009). Indeed, there is growing evidence that PES may reproduce or even exacerbate existing inequalities in social development and resource access (Kosoyand Corbera2010, Porras 2010). However, the gender dimensions of PES impacts has been the focus of little scholarship, despite concerns about women’s exclusion from participating (e.g., Kariukiand Birner2016) or their inclusion in ways that reduce their decision-making power within the household (e.g., Schwartz 2017).  This research uses a feminist political ecology lens to add to this small but growing body of work through an examination of how the PES program implementation influences gendered equity in access and outcomes of the associated sustainable land management (SLM) practices.";"Wangui, Elizabeth Edna

Hotspots are defined as places that experience high land degradation and if left unattended, will negatively affect both human wellbeing and the environment. The spatial location of hotspots was identified through a methodology combining modelling and field validation. Understanding the spatial locations helps identify hotspot areas and target them as priority intervention sites with relevant management options.

"handle:10568/91297";"Impact of soil depth and topography on the effectiveness of conservation practices on discharge and soil loss in the Ethiopian Highlands";"";"Restoration of degraded landscapes through the implementation of soil and water conservation practices is considered a viable option to increase agricultural production by enhancing ecosystems. However, in the humid Ethiopian highlands, little information is available on the impact of conservation practices despite wide scale implementation. The objective of this research was to document the effect of conservation practices on discharge and sediment concentration and load in watersheds that have different soil depths and topography. Precipitation, discharge, and sediment concentration were measured from 2010 to 2012 in two watersheds in close proximity and located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia: Tikur-Wuha and Guale watersheds. The Tikur-Wuha watershed has deep soils and a gentle slope stream channel. The Guale watershed has shallow soils and a steep slope stream channel. In early 2011, the local community installed upland conservation measures consisting of stone and soil bunds, waterways, cutoff drains, infiltration furrows, gully rehabilitation, and enclosures. The results show that conservation practices marginally decreased direct runoff in both watersheds and increased base flow in the Tikur-Wuha watershed. Average sediment concentration decreased by 81% in Tikur-Wuha and 45% in Guale. The practices intended to increase infiltration were most effective in the Tikur-Wuha watershed because the deep soil could store the infiltrated water and release it over a longer period of time after the rainy season than the steeper Guale watershed with shallow soils.";"Akal, Adugnaw T.

"handle:10568/91298";"Regional assessment of groundwater recharge in the lower Mekong Basin";"";"Groundwater recharge remains almost totally unknown across the Mekong River Basin, hindering the evaluation of groundwater potential for irrigation. A regional regression model was developed to map groundwater recharge across the Lower Mekong Basin where agricultural water demand is increasing, especially during the dry season. The model was calibrated with baseflow computed with the local-minimum flow separation method applied to streamflow recorded in 65 unregulated sub-catchments since 1951. Our results, in agreement with previous local studies, indicate that spatial variations in groundwater recharge are predominantly controlled by the climate (rainfall and evapotranspiration) while aquifer characteristics seem to play a secondary role at this regional scale. While this analysis suggests large scope for expanding agricultural groundwater use, the map derived from this study provides a simple way to assess the limits of groundwater-fed irrigation development. Further data measurements to capture local variations in hydrogeology will be required to refine the evaluation of recharge rates to support practical implementations.";"Lacombe, Guillaume

"handle:10568/91299";"Modeling smallholder farmers' preferences for soil management measures: a case study from South Ethiopia";"";"Land degradation is a major environmental problem in Ethiopia posing serious threats to agricultural productivity and livelihoods. The interactions of numerous socio-economic, demographic, natural, and institutional factors constitute the underlying causes of soil degradation in Ethiopia. However, there exist evidence gaps on the contextual factors that hinder investments on soil conservation among smallholders. Using primary data generated through a stated preference survey among 359 sample smallholder farm households in Southern Ethiopia, this study investigates investment constraints on soil management technologies among smallholders. A random parameter logit model was implemented to estimate the model. Results indicate that smallholders are willing to invest in soil management technologies if appropriate incentive mechanisms, primarily, secured land tenure rights and access to nance are in place. Unfortunately, the prevailing land tenure regime in the country does not allow private property rights on land and smallholders have very limited access to credit. Thus, instituting secure land rights and improving credit access to smallholders should be considered as key interventions to enhance adoption of soil management technologies. The study highlights that policy interventions that incentivize adoption of soil management measures provide not only on-site private bene ts but wider societal o -site bene ts through the provision of multiple ecosystem services.";"Tarfasa, S.

"handle:10568/89631";"Gender bias affects forests worldwide";"";"Gender biases persist in forestry research and practice. These biases result in reduced scientific rigor and inequitable, ineffective, and less efficient policies, programs, and interventions. Drawing from a two-volume collection of current and classic analyses on gender in forests, we outline five persistent and inter-related themes: gendered governance, tree tenure, forest spaces, division of labor, and ecological knowledge. Each emerges across geographic regions in the northern and southern hemisphere and reflects inequities in women’s and men’s ability to make decisions about and benefit from trees, forests, and their products. Women’s ability to participate in community-based forest governance is typically less than men’s, causing concern for social equity and forest stewardship. Women’s access to trees and their products is commonly more limited than men’s, and mediated by their relationship with their male counterparts. Spatial patterns of forest use reflect gender norms and taboos, and men’s greater access to transportation. The division of labor results in gender specialization in the collection of forest products, with variations in gender roles across regions. All these gender differences result in ecological knowledge that is distinct but also complementary and shifting across the genders. The ways gender plays out in relation to each theme may vary across cultures and contexts, but the influence of gender, which intersects with other factors of social differentiation in shaping forest landscapes, is global.";"Elias, M.

"handle:10568/89633";"Integrating Plant Science and Crop Modeling: Assessment of the Impact of Climate Change on Soybean and Maize Production";"";"Increasing global CO2 emissions have profound consequences for plant biology, not least because of direct influences on carbon gain. However, much remains uncertain regarding how our major crops will respond to a future high CO2 world. Crop model inter-comparison studies have identified large uncertainties and biases associated with climate change. The need to quantify uncertainty has drawn the fields of plant molecular physiology, crop breeding and biology, and climate change modeling closer together. Comparing data from different models that have been used to assess the potential climate change impacts on soybean and maize production, future yield losses have been predicted for both major crops. When CO2 fertilization effects are taken into account significant yield gains are predicted for soybean, together with a shift in global production from the Southern to the Northern hemisphere. Maize production is also forecast to shift northwards. However, unless plant breeders are able to produce new hybrids with improved traits, the forecasted yield losses for maize will only be mitigated by agro-management adaptations. In addition, the increasing demands of a growing world population will require larger areas of marginal land to be used for maize and soybean production. We summarize the outputs of crop models, together with mitigation options for decreasing the negative impacts of climate on the global maize and soybean production, providing an overview of projected land-use change as a major determining factor for future global crop production.";"Fodor, Nándor

"handle:10568/91728";"Modeling for Management: A Case Study of the Cañete watershed, Peru";"";"Introduction The Cañete River watershed located in the central Peruvian Andes, is undergoing hydrological changes due to global rising temperatures, landuse changes and increased water supply demand. At the river’s source in the ice-covered mountains at 5,800 m.a.s.l., changes in the landscape are evident given the ever receding snow covered ground. According to aerial photographs of the snowcap mountains, out of the 16 snow peaks that existed in 1962, only 11 remained in 1990 (Cementos Lima S.A.). Exacerbating this situation are the changes in land use occurring at the upper and middle watershed. The watershed’s natural habitat functions as a sponge, retaining much of the water that melts from the glaciers or that falls as precipitation (Wiegers et al., 1999). In addition, lakes, puddles, springs and creeks create a water holding network that transports and slows down water losses along the elevation gradient. Yet, changes in ecosystem dynamics affect the water holding capacity of the watershed, leading to more erratic water flows with longer dry periods and flush events.";"Francesconi, Wendy

"handle:10568/83487";"Assessing potential land suitable for surface irrigation using groundwater in Ethiopia";"";"Although Ethiopia has abundant land for irrigation, only a fraction of its potential land is being utilized. This study evaluates suitability of lands for irrigation using groundwater in Ethiopia using GIS-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) techniques in order to enhance the country's agricultural industry. Key factors that significantly affect irrigation suitability evaluated in this study include physical land features (land use, soil, and slope), climate (rainfall and evapotranspiration), and market access (proximity to roads and access to market). These factors were weighted using a pair-wise comparison matrix, then reclassified and overlaid to identify suitable areas for groundwater irrigation using a 1-km grid. Groundwater data from the British Geological Survey were used to estimate the groundwater potential, which indicates the corresponding irrigation potential for major crops. Results indicated that more than 6 million ha of land are suitable for irrigation in Ethiopia. A large portion of the irrigable land is located in the Abbay, Rift Valley, Omo Ghibe, and Awash River basins. These basins have access to shallow groundwater (i.e., depth of groundwater less than 20 m from the surface) making it easier to extract. The comparison between available groundwater and total crop water requirements indicate that groundwater alone may not be sufficient to supply all suitable land. The study estimates that only 8% of the suitable land can be irrigated with the available shallow groundwater. However, groundwater is a viable option for supplementing surface water resources for irrigation in several basins in the country.";"Worqlul, A. W.

Power subsidies have grown these markets and made them pro-poor, but are also responsible for groundwater depletion, and for financial troubles of electricity distribution companies of India or DISCOMs. Gujarat has successfully reduced subsidies by rationing farm power supply, and West Bengal has done so by charging farmers commercial power tariff on metered consumption. Subsidy reforms have hit poor farmers and tenants hard in both the states. Gujarat has tried to support the poor, with some success, by prioritising them in allocating new tube well connections. We argue that West Bengal too can support its poor by tweaking its farm power pricing formula to turn a sellers’ water market into a buyers’ one.";"Shah, Tushaar

"handle:10568/97625";"Groundwater evaporation ponds: a viable option for the management of shallow saline waterlogged areas";"";"The province of Punjab is the main food basket of India. In recent years, many regions of Punjab are facing acute waterlogging problems and increased secondary salinity, which have negative impacts on food security of the nation. In particular, these problems are more pronounced in the Muktsar district of Punjab. The observed groundwater levels trend between 2005 and 2011 implies that groundwater levels are coming towards the land surface at the rate of 0.5 m/year in Lambi and Malout blocks. In this study, a groundwater flow model was constructed using MODFLOW to understand the groundwater table dynamics and to test the groundwater evaporation ponds to draw down the groundwater levels in the waterlogging areas of Muktsar district. The predicted flow model results indicate that groundwater levels could be depleted at the rate of 0.3 m/year between 2012 and 2018 after the construction of Groundwater Evaporation Ponds (GEP). In addition, the constructed ponds can be used for aquaculture that generates additional income. The proposed GEP method may be a promising tool and suitable for the reduction of waterlogging in any region if there is no proper surface drainage, and also for enhancement of agricultural production that improves the social and economic status of the farming community.";"Surinaidu, L.

"handle:10568/99181";"Climate-Smart Agriculture for Punjab, Pakistan";"";"The climate-smart agriculture (CSA) concept reflects an ambition
to improve the integration of agriculture development and climate
responsiveness. It aims to achieve food security and broader
development goals under a changing climate and increasing food
demand. CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance
resilience, and reduce/remove greenhouse gases (GHGs), and
require planning to address trade-offs and synergies between
these three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and mitigation [1].
The priorities of different countries and stakeholders are reflected
to achieve more efficient, effective, and equitable food systems
that address challenges in environmental, social, and economic
dimensions across productive landscapes. While the concept is
new, and still evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA
already exist worldwide and are used by farmers to cope with
various production risks [2]. Mainstreaming CSA requires critical
stocktaking of ongoing and promising practices for the future,
and of institutional and financial enablers for CSA adoption. This
country profile provides a snapshot of a developing baseline
created to initiate discussion, both within countries and globally,
about entry points for investing in CSA at scale.";"International Center for tropical Agriculture (CIAT)

"handle:10568/83485";"Impact of institutional change on irrigation management: a case study from southern Uzbekistan";"";"The rapidly growing population in Uzbekistan has put massive pressure on limited water resources, resulting in frequent water shortages. Irrigation is by far the major water use. Improving irrigation water use through the institutional change of establishing water consumer associations (WCAs) has been identified as a way to increase agricultural production and meet the food demand in the area. However, most WCAs are not fully able to organize collective action or generate sufficient funds to carry out their responsibilities. This study investigated the water-resource-related challenges faced by WCAs and local farmers in Kashkadarya Province in Uzbekistan, using semi-structured expert interviews and focus group discussions. The resulting data were analyzed using qualitative analysis software (Atlas.ti). The results indicated that outdated infrastructure, poor governance, and farmers’ non-payment of irrigation service fees hamper sustainable water management. Greater trust and communication within the WCAs would make an important contribution to effective collective action and to the long-term sustainability of local associations.";"Djumaboev, Kakhramon

"handle:10568/97170";"Integrated soil, water and agronomic management effects on crop productivity and selected soil properties in Western Ethiopia";"";"Land degradation is a major challenge limiting crop production in Ethiopia. Integrated soil and water conservation is widely applied as a means to reverse the trend and increase productivity. This study investigated the effects of such integrated approaches at two sites, Jeldu and Diga, in Western Ethiopia. A split plot design with physical soil and water conservation in the main plots and agronomic practices in the sub plots was employed. Maize (Zea mays L.) followed by groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) at Diga, and wheat (Triticum aestivum) followed by faba bean (Vicia faba L.) were the test crops. Surface soils were sampled before sowing and after the crop harvest, and analyzed for selected parameters. Soil moisture content during the growing period was also monitored. The use of soil bund increased soil moisture content, and significantly (P < 0.05) increased days to flowering and maturity, kernel weight and harvest index, grain yield of the test crops, with the exception of maize. The improved agronomic practices (intercropping, fertilization and row planting) significantly (P < 0.05) increased grain yield of all the test crops. The effect of the treatments on soil parameters may require longer time to be evident. Although the increase in crop yield due to soil bund and the improved agronomic practices is eminent, economic analysis is necessary before recommending the widespread use of the improved options.";"Erkossa, Teklu

First, we reviewed established environmental policy tools and the legal and policy framework, and determined whether innovative financing mechanisms are working in other areas with a similar context. We undertook stakeholder analyses and mapping to identify key stakeholders, and to assess their possible roles in the implementation of a sustainable financing mechanism for watershed rehabilitation. We also determined whether opportunities exist for financing mechanisms involving hydropower and urban water supply in payments for ecosystem services (PES), and the global community in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the context of the Bale Eco-region. The study identified major constraints to designing an appropriate financing mechanism. Finally, the study drew important conclusions and key policy implications that are relevant for Ethiopia and perhaps other areas in a similar context.";"Hagos, Fitsum

The use of static land-use in most hydrologic models or that of the use of simple hydrologic proxies in land-use change models call for more integrated approaches. The objective of this study is to assess whether dynamic feedback between land-use change and hydrology can (1) improve model performances, and/or (2) produce a more realistic quantification of ecosystem services. To test this, we coupled a land-use change model and a hydrologic mode. First, the land-use change and the hydrologic models were separately developed and calibrated. Then, the two models were dynamically coupled to exchange data at yearly time-steps. The approach is applied to a catchment in South Africa. Performance of coupled models when compared to the uncoupled models were marginal, but the coupled models excelled at the quantification of catchment ecosystem services more robustly.";"Yalew, S. G.

Consequently, economic development and food security are also lagging behind. Since the mid-2000s there has been a resurgence in the willingness to invest in irrigation, and Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest potential of any developing region to benefit from it. However, to gain from new investment in irrigation without repeating past failures, it is critical to develop a business model for small-scale irrigation schemes. This article explores the barriers that such a model needs to address to be successful and the opportunities this represents for irrigators’ profitability.";"Bjornlund, Henning

"handle:10568/93058";"Independent data for transparent monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector – What do stakeholders think and need?";"";"The agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectors contribute substantially to the net global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To reduce these emissions under the Paris Agreement, effective mitigation actions are needed that require engagement of multiple stakeholders. Emission reduction also requires that accurate, consistent and comparable datasets are available for transparent reference and progress monitoring. Availability of free and open datasets and portals (referred to as independent data) increases, offering opportunities for improving and reconciling estimates of GHG emissions and mitigation options. Through an online survey, we investigated stakeholders’ data needs for estimating forest area and change, forest biomass and emission factors, and AFOLU GHG emissions. The survey was completed by 359 respondents from governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, research institutes and universities, and public and private companies. These can be grouped into data users and data providers. Our results show that current open and freely available datasets and portals are only able to fulfil stakeholder needs to a certain degree. Users require a) detailed documentation regarding the scope and usability of the data, b) comparability between alternative data sources, c) uncertainty estimates for evaluating mitigation options, d) more region-specific and detailed data with higher accuracy for sub-national application, e) regular updates and continuity for establishing consistent time series. These requirements are found to be key elements for increasing overall transparency of data sources, definitions, methodologies and assumptions, which is required under the Paris Agreement. Raising awareness and improving data availability through centralized platforms are important for increasing engagement of data users. In countries with low capacities, independent data can support countries’ mitigation planning and implementation, and related GHG reporting. However, there is a strong need for further guidance and capacity development (i.e. ‘readiness support’) on how to make proper use of independent datasets. Continued investments will be needed to sustain programmes and keep improving datasets to serve the objectives of the many stakeholders involved in climate change mitigation and should focus on increased accessibility and transparency of data to encourage stakeholder involvement.";"Romijn, Erika

"handle:10568/96025";"Production prospects for cassava in Tanzania: COSCA working paper, No. 16";"";"Several cassava genotypes were observed although there were few bred varieties. The wide diversity in the cassava landraces was a consequence of the action of the farmers in continuously abandoning and introducing cultivars into their system as they tried to select those cultivars that met their needs. These included extended in ground storability in remote areas, high lOOt yield, and earliness in high demographic pressure areas, low cyanogen level in specific areas where the sweet cassava type was needed, as well as their needs for pests/disease tolerance, and good processing qualities. All the landraces were of a local type with low genetic yield potential and did not seem to resist major pests/diseases of the cassava plant. Declining fallow periods constituted a constraint to expansion in cassava production; because of cassava's long growth cycle farmers were not able to grow the crop under Continuous cultivation as frequently as they were able to grow some other crops as they got low cassava yields. Cassava was more frequently used to close a rotation cycle where the crop was stored in fallow fields in remote areas with low demographic or market pressures. The crop was, however, more frequently used to open a rotation cycle under severe pest/disease pressure conditions, under high market pressure conditions where the crop was harvested early. And under conditions of free grazing of cattle where farmers were not able to store the crop in fallow fields. Cassava was intercropped more frequently than the average for other crops; however, within the intercrop, cassava was the major crop more often than other crops. Maize and beans or peas were most frequently intercropped with cassava. Other management practices, especially plant density and age at harvest, were not adopted at optimal levels; in high market pressure areas where superior practices were adopted, lOOt yield improved significantly. Cassava was produced with relevant purchased inputs as frequently as, and in some cases more frequently than other staples. The frequencies of use of hired labor and mechanized transportation were positively correlated with proximity to market centers. Cassava production did not respond positively in terms of high root yield and especially in terms of land area expansion because of the low frequencies of the use of the various purchased inputs. In addition, the incidence of cassava green mite (COM), an arthropod pest of the cassava plant which was widespread, must have discouraged farmers from expanding cassava land area. It could have also resulted in low yields, even in fields in which the purchased inputs were used, while farmers ranked cassava in order of relative importance based on the food security value of the crop, they allocated land to it based on its market value. Cassava was allocated relatively more farmland in areas where farmers had access to market or to improved postharvest handling facilities than elsewhere. Famine was not reported where cassava was relatively important.The range of cassava food products was narrow. Cassava was transformed predominantly into a non-convenient food product which could not compete effectively with food grains in the market and therefore did not have as many market opportunities as cassava food products made in other countries, especially in West or Central Africa. Farmers in remote villages who had access to mechanized processing facilities planted relatively more cassava for sale than farmers who had easy access to market centers. Farmers in the areas surveyed depended more on nonfarm activities and, to some extent, on industrial crops than on food crops for cash income. Cassava production was, however, more important than any other food crop as a source of cash income for the producing households. Cash income from the cassava production benefitted more households than cash income from any other food crop. The cassava production cash income was highest among farmers who had access to mechanized processing technology, or easy access to market centers, or among those who used purchased inputs in production. In conclusion, cassava production was declining in a large proportion of the producing villages because production was not positively linked with market; market access infrastructure was inadequate, processing methods were rudimentary, and the range of cassava food products was narrow. Hence, there was no market incentive to motivate farmers to adopt known superior agronomic management practices, or to use purchased inputs to expand land area. Cassava varieties available to the farmers have low genetic potential in yield and poor resistance to major pests and diseases.";"Nweke, F.

"handle:10568/97759";"Responding to Climate Change in Tropical Countries Emerging from Armed Conflicts: Harnessing Climate Finance, Peacebuilding, and Sustainable Food";"";"Linking climate action with sustainable development goals (SDGs) might incentivize social and political support to forest conservation. However, further examination of the conceptual entry points for linking efforts for reducing forest-based emissions with those for delivering SDGs is required. This review paper aims to contribute to fulfilling this research need. It provides insights into the links between conserving forests for climate change mitigation and peacebuilding. Specifically, the paper examines opportunities to harness climate finance for conserving forests and achieving long-lasting peace and sustainable food. It does so via a literature review and the examination of the Orinoquia region of Colombia. The findings from the literature review suggest that harnessing climate finance for conserving forests and peacebuilding is, in theory, viable if the activities are designed in accordance with social, institutional, and economic factors. Meanwhile, the Orinoquia region provides evidence that these two seemingly intractable problems are proposed to be solved together. At a time when efforts for reducing forest-based emissions are being designed and targeted at (post-) conflict areas in Colombia and elsewhere, the paper’s findings might demonstrate the compatibility of programs aimed at reducing forest-based emissions with efforts relating to peacebuilding and sustainable food to both environmental and non-environmental government agencies.";"Castro-Nuñez, Augusto";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture";"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute";"CGIAR";"2018-10-10";"en";"deforestation;forest conservation;climate change";"Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate change & Environment;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"013;COL;005";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/97759";"";"";"Creative Commons Attribution";"CC-BY-4.0";"";"";"101257"

"handle:10568/92491";"Climate-Smart Agriculture in Ethiopia";"";"The agriculture sector is the backbone of Ethiopia’s economy and livelihoods. Yet, heavy reliance on rain-fed systems has made the sector particularly vulnerable to variability in rainfall and temperature. Climate change may decrease national gross domestic product (GDP) by 8–10% by 2050, but adaptation action in agriculture could cut climate shock-related losses by half. • Climate risk management interventions and long-term adaptation actions need to match localized vulnerabilities and impacts. The drought-prone highland areas are likely to experience more intense and irregular rainfall, affecting yields of slow maturing, long-cycle crops; however, the higher altitude moisture-sufficient parts of the highlands where cereal production is dominant are expected to increase in suitability and productivity of some cereals. Increased temperatures and extended drought periods are likely to negatively affect the lowlands, posing particular challenges to already vulnerable pastoral and agropastoral populations. • Smallholder farmers produce over 90% of the agricultural output in Ethiopia. Despite high usage of traditional production methods, there is evidence of increased use of organic fertilizers, adoption of crop varieties with higher resistance/tolerance to drought, pests, and diseases, and improved livestock feeding practices, as attempts to increase productivity and resilience, but also with cobenefits in terms of reducing agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. • Given the country’s poverty and food insecurity challenges, priorities for economic growth and increased resilience have pushed mitigation efforts backstage. Less than one-fifth of the climate finance is directed to mitigation efforts, mostly through renewable energy. Increased investments in agricultural practices that bring about mitigation co-benefits would bring out agriculture’s role as a lead sector in low-emissions development. • A large proportion of the country’s land area is undergoing some form of soil erosion or land degradation, hence CSA-related efforts have been focused on restoring degraded lands through soil and water conservation measures, agroforestry, farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR), area closures, and dissemination of improved varieties. Such CSA practices and technologies are largely supported by the government and its development partners, through research and development, rural extension and advisory services as well as direct implementation. Many of these practices are implemented within the framework of the integrated watershed management approach through projects such as the Sustainable Land Management Programme (SLMP). • Adoption levels of some CSA practices and technologies, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, among smallholder farmers remain low. Increased public and private support to enable access to improved inputs, equipment, credit and insurance schemes is needed to boost farmers’ ability to manage risks and invest in long-term climate actions. • Highly fragmented land units are not suited for effective implementation of some CSA practices, while land tenure regimes can significantly hinder credit access for smallholders. Ethiopia has made great effort to issue land certificates to smallholder farmers, and such programmes should be accompanied by sensitization of farmers and microfinance providers on the costs and benefits of investing in on-farm climate-smart and sustainable land management practices. • Through an ambitious policy framework built largely on the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Strategy and an enabling institutional infrastructure, Ethiopia has taken major steps towards mainstreaming climate change into agricultural planning. To demonstrate its unwavering commitments to green growth and food security and operationalize strategies and plans, additional national and international resources need to be mobilized over the next years, to fill existing financial gaps.";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture

"handle:10568/92496";"A watershed approach to managing rainfed agriculture in the semiarid region of southern Mali: integrated research on water and land use";"";"Soil and water conservation (SWC) practices like that of erosion control and soil fertility measures were commonly practiced in the semiarid region of southern Mali since the 1980s. The SWC practices were mainly meant to increase water availability in the subsurface, reduce farm water runoff and gully formation and improve nutrient content of the soil, thereby increasing crop yield. Despite such efforts to promote at scale SWC practices, the landscape of southern Mali is still affected by high rates of runoff and soil erosion and low crop yield in farmers’ fields. Data are lacking on previous beneficial SWC practices that could be adapted for wider application. In this paper, a watershed approach to managing rainfed agriculture is presented to show potential benefits of SWC practices at field and watershed scales. The approach included (1) community participation in establishing and monitoring new sets of hydro-meteorological monitoring stations and field experiments; (2) studying the dynamics and consumptive water uses of different land uses over time; and (3) evaluating the biophysical and economic advantages of SWC practices";"Birhanu, Birhanu Zemadim

"handle:10568/77725";"The role of contracts in improving access to credit in the smallholder livestock sector of Swaziland";"";"The study investigates the role of contract farming in improving access to credit for smallholder cattle producers, cattle finishers and traders in Swaziland. The contracts are verbal or informal and involve smallholder cattle producers, cattle finishers and traders on the one hand and other stakeholders in the value chain on the other. The study determined (a) the credit access status of smallholder cattle producers, finishers and traders, and whether participating in contracts leads to improved access to credit; and (b) identified factors that determine smallholder farmers’, finishers’ and traders’ access to credit from formal financial institutions and those that may lead farmers to become involved in contracts with other actors in the value chain. Two sets of structured questionnaires were designed to capture the required data for farmers, finishers and traders. The sample size was 111: 53 cattle producers, 36 cattle finishers and 22 cattle traders. Two logistic regression models were applied. One model was employed to identify factors that determine access to credit from formal financial institutions. The other model was employed to identify factors that may lead farmers to become involved in contracts with other actors in the value chain. The descriptive results indicate that 36 %of cattle producers, 36 % of cattle finishers, and 50 % of cattle traders have access to credit from financial institutions. Informal channels, such as friends and relatives, are the predominant lenders. The results from the logit model for participation in formal contracts indicate that off-farm income, better access to extension services, being a member of a farmers’ association, having access to assured market and access to marketing information are positively associated with farmers’ involvement in contract agreements. The logit model on formal credit access indicates that income received from other business activities, age of the farmer, herd size, and training in beef cattle production had significant effects on a farmer’s probability of having access to formal credit. The results further reveal that participating in contracts does not determine access to credit from formal financial institutions. The study makes recommendations for increasing farmers’ involvement in formal contract agreements, particularly by enhancing access to market, improvements in capacity building and, encouragement of collective action of farmers. In addition, their involvement might be improved by increasing farmers’ access to credit from formal institutions by encouraging beef cattle farmers to diversify, thus receiving income from other businesses, and also the provision of producer training (and trader training) on marketing and production activities. It is further concluded that participating in contracts does not lead to improved access to credit and also access to credit relatively decreases participating in contracts. There is need to target the implementation and the monitoring of credit interventions for smallholder cattle farmers in order to improve their access to credit and participation in contract farming.";"Mamba, T.X.";"University of Pretoria";"International Livestock Research Institute";"CGIAR";"2016-07-30";"en";"rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"018;002;SWZ";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/77725";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"79834"
"handle:10568/92018";"Determinants of diarrhoeal morbidity: The case of children under five years of age among agricultural and agro-pastoralist community of southern Ethiopia";"";"Background: Diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the under-five children in low-income countries. Despite improvements in water and sanitation coverage, studies show that diarrhoea is still a major public health problem in Ethiopia. This study was designed to determine the magnitude and risk factors of diarrhoea in the agricultural and agro-pastoralist communities of the rural Sidama zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2013. Interview and questionnaire were the main data gathering instruments used in the study. Data for the study was collected from 1939 mothers/caregivers of the children. The children were under five years of age during the data collection period. Structured questions were used to collect data for the study. SPSS software V 19 was used to analyze the data based on a predefined conceptual model, including interrelated determinants. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was computed to assess independent factors of childhood diarrhoea.
Results: Slightly over 95% of the participants were from Sidama ethnic background and about 88% of them were Participants. The number of male children in the study was slightly higher (53%) than that of the female participants. The mean and median ages of the children were 33.53 and 35 months, respectively. The prevalence of diarrhoea in the two weeks prior to the study was 25.6%.
The occurrence of diarrhea was significantly associated with household heads following traditional religion (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.40; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) =1.49-3.88)), living in rented or shared houses (OR: 2.00; 95% CI=1.14 -3.51), living in agro-pastoralist (OR: 1.84; 95% CI=1.29-2.63), and Midland agriculturalists areas (OR: 1.50; 95% CI=1.04-2.14).
In addition, storing drinking water for more than two days (OR: 1.74; 95% CI=1.27-2.37), the presence of diarrhoea in the family members other than the index child (OR: 1.35; 95% CI=1.05-1.74), children being in the age group of 6-12 months (OR: 2.459; 95% CI=1.676-3.608) and 13-24 months (OR: 1.619; 95% CI=1.103-2.377) were strongly associated with the under-five diarrhoeal morbidity (p.0.05).
Conclusions: The study showed that diarrhoea was a major health problem of the under five among the agro-pastoralist communities. Socioeconomic, environmental, household and childcare related factors have influenced the transmission of diarrhoea in the study setting. Delivery of improved sanitation and hygiene suitable for agro-pastoralist communities may have a significant importance on the child health and survival in the study area.";"Beyene, Hunachew

"handle:10568/3826";"Mapping hotspots of climate change and food insecurity in the global tropics";"";"This study was coordinated by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) to identify areas that are food insecure and vulnerable to the impacts of future climate change, across the priority regions for the CGIAR centres. The research was undertaken by a team of scientists from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). The study relied on maps: first, of variables that indicate the different aspects of food security (availability, access and utilization), and second, of thresholds of climate change exposure important for agricultural systems. Vulnerability was assessed using a domain approach based upon
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework of vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity and coping capacity. Nine domains were identified; for each domain, areas of the tropics were classified by high or low exposure, high or low sensitivity, and high or low coping capacity.";"Ericksen, Polly J.

"handle:10568/99741";"Restoring Degraded Rangelands in Jordan: Optimizing Mechanized Micro Water Harvesting using Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM).";"";"Jordan's rangelands, the so called Badia, home of the Bedouins, are threatened through a combination of over-exploitation of the ecosystem services and a changing climate towards drier seasons and highly erratic rainfalls. In the recent decades, the once productive grazing lands transformed into sparsely vegetated and crusted desert grounds not capable of retaining the sporadic rainwater within the landscape - and consequential surface runoff inevitably accelerates soil erosion and gullying. To counter-measure the imminent rangeland degradation the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) is investigating mechanized micro Water Harvesting (WH) based restoration technique using the Vallerani plow. This technique intermediately breaks up the crusted surface soil layers and hard pans to approximately 50cm depth. Thus, creating dispersed micro-catchments, well-protected and suitable for the plantation of shrub seedlings, supporting the initial vegetation growth and eventually leading to shrub-island evolvement over the landscape. However, optimum design, particularly the spacing between the WH plow lines, depend on various environmental conditions. In this research, Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) was used to assess degraded rangeland hydrological response to transparently suggest on WH layout optimized for the magnitudes and the occurrence probabilities of runoff, soil erosion and sediment accumulation affecting the storage capacity of the micro-catchments. The study combined physical based modeling and ground truthing through different runoff and sediment related experiments. Preliminary results demonstrate good potential of the RHEM-based WH design approach; case study results will be presented for the first time at the conference. Eventually, a fully developed rangeland assessment system will support transparent target area selection and sound WH design interlinked with a risk analysis approach that accounts for the variable environmental patterns of the Badia.";"Strohmeier, Stefan

"handle:10568/81162";"Patterns and drivers of dairy development in India: insights from analysis of household and district-level data";"";"Traditionally, Indian farmers kept bovines, especially cattle, for draught purposes in agriculture and transportation with milk as an adjunct. However, with increasing farm mechanization and rising demand for milk, the bovine functions have shifted more towards dairying. While bovine population has been increasing, the chronic scarcity of feed and fodder reinforces the need for optimization of bovine population for sustainable growth of dairying. In this paper, using district-level data from 1997 to 2007, we show that this transformation from draught to dairying is underway in some parts of the country, and further using household-level data, we find that smallholders have contributed disproportionately more to this transformation. This transformation or intensification of dairying is demand-driven with urbanization having a strong positive influence on dairy development. On the supply-side, factors like farm mechanization, improved access to groundwater irrigation and crop diversification away from cereals, are associated with a shift in the bovine economy from draught to dairying.";"Kishore, A.

Brucellosis is caused by bacteria from the genus Brucella which infect human and domestic animals as well as wildlife. The Maasai Mara National Reserve has vast populations of wild ruminants such as buffaloes and wildebeest which could contribute to the risk of brucellosis in livestock, and the surrounding pastoralist communities grazing cattle in and around the reserve may be exposed to a higher risk of zoonotic diseases like brucellosis due to the close contact with livestock. In this study, cattle from three villages at varying distance from the reserve, were screened for antibodies against Brucella abortus.

Results

In total, 12.44% of 225 sampled animals were seropositive, with more females (15%) infected than males (5%). Seroprevalence was higher in livestock closer to Maasai Mara with the cattle in the village Mara Rianta having an odds ratio of 7.03 compared to Endoinyo Narasha further away (95% CI 1.4–11.1, p = 0.003), suggesting that a closer contact with wildlife may increase the circulation of infectious diseases between livestock and wildlife. Symptoms consistent with brucellosis were reported to occur in both humans and animals, and we thus conclude that brucellosis may be an important problem, both for the health and the economy.";"Enström, S.

The use of static land-use in most hydrologic models or that of the use of simple hydrologic proxies in land-use change models call for more integrated approaches. The objective of this study is to assess whether dynamic feedback between land-use change and hydrology can (1) improve model performances, and/or (2) produce a more realistic quantification of ecosystem services. To test this, we coupled a land-use change model and a hydrologic mode. First, the land-use change and the hydrologic models were separately developed and calibrated. Then, the two models were dynamically coupled to exchange data at yearly time-steps. The approach is applied to a catchment in South Africa. Performance of coupled models when compared to the uncoupled models were marginal, but the coupled models excelled at the quantification of catchment ecosystem services more robustly.";"Yalew, S. G.

Eight water quality and nine soil parameters were analysed using field kits at 95 sites in March 2015. Elevated electrical conductivity and chloride were apparent at two sites due to geogenic leaching from the marine rock-salt present in some areas. Groundwater was acidic in most locations. Nitrate and faecal contamination were also observed from nitrogenous fertilizers (diffuse) and from leaky sewage pits (localised) respectively. Soil quality is neither nutrient deficient nor does it pose a threat to plant growth. Where groundwater is used for drinking, removal of bacterial contamination by simple filtration or boiling is sufficient. In the absence of a functional monitoring network in the Vientiane Plain, periodic surveys of this kind should be performed. The results should be made widely available to the relevant government departments and other stakeholders for better management of the land and water resources.";"Brindha, K.

"handle:10568/96638";"Centralized versus distributed reservoirs: an investigation of their implications on environmental flows and sustainable water resources management";"";"Storage of surface water is widely regarded as a form of insurance against rainfall variability. However, creation of surface storage often endanger the functions of natural ecosystems, and, in turn, ecosystem services that bene t humans. The issues of optimal size, placement and the number of reservoirs in a river basin – which maximizes sustainable bene ts from storage – remain subjects for debate. This study examines the above issues through the analysis of a range of reservoir con gurations in the Malwatu Oya river basin in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The study produced multiple surface storage development pathways for the basin under different scenarios of environmental  ow (EF) releases and reservoir network con gurations. The EF scenarios ranged from “zero” to “very healthy” releases. It is shown that if the “middle ground” between the two extreme EF scenarios is considered, the theoretical maximum “safe” yield from surface storage is about 65–70% of the mean annual runoff (MAR) of the basin. It is also identi ed that although distribution of reservoirs in the river network reduces the cumulative yield from the basin, this cumulative yield is maximized if the ratio among the storage capacities placed in each sub drainage basin is equivalent to the ratio among their MAR. The study suggests a framework to identify drainage regions having higher surface storage potential, to plan for the right distribution of storage capacity within a river basin, as well as to plan for EF allocations.";"Eriyagama, Nishadi

When a greenhouse trial was undertaken to test the response of Cajanus cajan to rhizobial inoculation, N and P fertilization in these soils, no response was obtained in either the Río Hato or Los Santos soils. There was a definite response to P and a slight response to inoculation in the Pacora soil, which had the poorest fertility level. N applications depressed nodulation. The lack of response of Cajanus cajan to P in the Río Hato soil was attributed to the high incidence (55 percent) of VA mycorrhizal infection. Inoculation of Cajanus cajan with both Rhizobium and Glomus may be important in low-fertility soils.";"Hernández, B.C.

"handle:10568/82007";"World and Asian markets for cassava products";"";"This analysis of global and Asian markets looks at protectionism and substitution (decline in starch trade, rise in trade of cassava feedstuffs) and the Asian regional market for cassava feedstuffs. The degree of substitution between cassava and grains has increased measurably during the postwar period. Cassava's future in world markets depends on its ability to compete with grains; so far this has depended on grain pricing policies and tariff structures of importing countries, making cassava trade more vulnerable than the international grain trade. Cassava competes on a cost, not a price basis. If growth in cassava exports is based on small farm production, initial growth would be based on small-scale processing units, which would call for developing a critical production vol. based on domestic markets, in the 1st place. Except for Thailand, production has not been able to meet the rising demand for products. Improved var. and production technology could provide the increased vol. necessary to meet the domestic demand. Then, if surpluses develop resulting in cost reductions, the country could compete in international markets. (CIAT)||Este analisis de los mercados mundiales y asiaticos contempla las politicas de proteccionismo y sustitucion (reduccion en la comercializacion del almidon y aumento en la comercializacion de los concentrados a base de yuca), en particular, y el mercado regional asiatico para alimentos para animales. El nivel de sustitucion entre la yuca y los granos ha aumentado considerablemente durante el periodo de posguerra. El futuro de la yuca en los mercados mundiales depende de su habilidad para competir con los granos; hasta ahora, esto ha dependido de las politicas de precios de los granos y las estructuras de las tarifas de los paises importadores, haciendo que la comercializacion de la yuca sea mas vulnerable que la comercializacion mundial de granos. La yuca compite con base en el costo y no en el precio. Si el crecimiento en las exportaciones de yuca se basa en la produccion en fincas pequenas, el crecimiento inicial se basaria en unidades de procesamiento en pequena escala, lo que requeriria el desarrollo de un vol. critico de produccion con base en los mercados nacionales, principalmente. A excepcion de Tailandia, la produccion no ha podido satisfacer la creciente demanda de este producto. Mediante el uso de tecnologia de produccion y var. mejoradas se podria proporcionar un mayor vol., necesario para suplir la demanda nacional. Entonces, si se obtienen excedentes con la consiguiente reduccion de costos, el pais podria competir en los mercados internacionales.

"handle:10568/88061";"Effect of cutting time on agronomic and nutritional characteristics of nine commercial cultivars of Brachiaria grass compared with Napier grass during establishment under semi-arid conditions in Rwanda";"";"A study was conducted to identify the most productive cultivars and their cutting management to optimize nutrient productivity in semi-arid areas of Rwanda. Four cultivars of Brachiaria brizantha (Piatá, MG4, Marandú and Xaraes), two cultivars of Brachiaria humidicola (Llanero and Humidicola), two cultivars of Brachiaria hybrid (Mulato and Mulato II) and one cultivar of Brachiaria decumbens (Basilisk) were evaluated against Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) in an on-farm trial in a complete randomised block design with four replicates. Forage samples were collected at 60, 90 and 120 days after planting (DAP) and analysed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), organic matter (OM) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). The nutritional values were also estimated using in vitro gas production (IVGP) and its kinetic parameters, in vitro apparent degradable dry matter (ivADDM), digestible organic matter (DOM), metabolisable energy (ME), partitioning factor (PF) and degradable efficiency factor (DEF). For all cultivars and species, the DM, CP, OM, ivADDM and DOM increased from 60 to 90 DAP and declined thereafter. The NDF contents increased with increase in plant age. Grasses cut at 90 DAP had the highest gas production. The ME differed among grasses and DAP where Piatá had the highest. Furthermore, degradability parameters (A, B, C) and half time (T1/2) differed among grasses and between cutting times. The PF and DEF were correlated with ME. The most promising cultivars were Basilisk, Marandú, Piatá and Mulato II because of their high in these nutritional characteristics.";"Mutimura, Mupenzi

We measured GHG fluxes from intact soil cores collected in Rakai, Uganda, an area characterized by low‐input smallholder (<2 ha) farming systems, typical for the East African highlands. The soil cores were air dried and rewetted to water holding capacities (WHCs) of 30, 55, and 80%. Soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured for 48 h following rewetting. Cumulative N2O fluxes were highest from soils under perennial crops and the lowest from soils under annual crops (P < 0.001 for all WHC). At WHC of 55% or 80%, the sandy clay loam soils had lower N2O fluxes than the clay soils (P < 0.001 and P = 0.041, respectively). Cumulative soil CO2 fluxes were highest from eucalyptus plantations and lowest from annual crops across multiple WHC (P = 0.014 at 30% WHC and P < 0.001 at both 55 and 80% WHC). Methane fluxes were below detectable limits, a shortcoming for using soil cores from the top soil. This study reveals that land use and soil type have strong effects on GHG fluxes from agricultural land in the study area. Field monitoring of fluxes is needed to confirm whether these findings are consistent with what happens in situ.";"Wanyama, Ibrahim

In this study, biophysical and socio-economic data, farmers’ community surveys and secondary data from remote sensing on soil characteristics and water demand were used to evaluate the predictors of drought in inland valley rice-based production systems and the factors affecting farmers’ mitigation measures. The study intervened in three West African countries located in the Sudan-Sahel zone, viz. Burkina Faso, Mali and Nigeria. Significant drying trends occurred at latitudes below 11°30' whilst significant wetting trends were discerned at latitude above 11°30'. Droughts were more frequent and had their longest duration in the states of Niger and Kaduna located in Nigeria and in western Burkina Faso during the period 1995–2014. Among 21 candidate predictors, average annual standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and duration of groundwater availability were the most important predictors of drought occurrence in inland valleys rice based-production systems. Land ownership and gender affected the commitment of rice farmers to use any mitigation measure against drought. Drought studies in inland valleys should include climatic water balance and groundwater data. Securing property rights and focusing on women’s association would improve farmers’ resilience and advance drought mitigation measures.";"Dossou-Yovo, E. R.

"handle:10568/99287";"Effect of climate change on land suitability for surface irrigation and irrigation potential of the shallow groundwater in Ghana";"";"Estimating the potential land resources suitable for irrigation and evaluating the possible impact of climate change on land suitability is essential for planning a sustainable agricultural system. This study applied a GIS-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique to evaluate the suitability of land for irrigation in Ghana for a baseline period (1990 to 2010) and future time horizons 2050s (2041 to 2060) and 2070s (2061 to 2080). Key factors considered to evaluate the suitability of the land for irrigation include biophysical features (such as climate, land use, soil, and slope) and socioeconomic factors (such as proximity to roads and population density). These factors were weighted using a pairwise comparison matrix then reclassified and overlaid on a 30 m grid to estimate the irrigation potential of the country. Groundwater data from the British Geological Survey (BGS) were superimposed onto the land suitability map layer to evaluate the irrigation potential and the accessibility of shallow groundwater with simple water lifting technologies. Downscaled and bias-corrected future climate data from HadGEM2-ES under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 emission scenario were used to represent the future climate horizon. Due to climate change, on average, rainfall will increase by 15 mm and 20 mm from the baseline period in the 2050s and 2070s, respectively. The average temperature shows a consistent increase in the majority of Ghana and a higher rate of increase is expected in the 2070s. Consequently, the rising temperature will increase the potential evapotranspiration by 6.0% and 7.6% in the 2050s and 2070s, respectively. The suitability analysis indicates that approximately 9% of the country is suitable for surface irrigation under the baseline period. A large portion of the potential land is located in the southwestern part of the country. The potential suitable land has an average groundwater access of 12 m from the surface with an average borehole potential yield of 2.5 L/second, which makes it favorable for utilization of simple water lifting technologies. Due to climate change, 9.5% of the suitable land will become unfavorable for irrigation in 2050s, and it is expected to reach 17% in 2070s.";"Worqlul, A. W.

Compartió con Siberia Oriental el chamanismo y con él la búsqueda de plantas y hongos alucinógenos y, como consecuencia, el conocimiento detallado de la flora y el continuo interés por experimentar. Al entrar en el interior del continente americano, nuestra especie contribuyó –por la caza continua– a la extinción de su megafauna. Una alteración climática hace 12 000-10 000 años (‘Dryas Joven’) obligó a cambiar un patrón de aprovechamiento de recursos naturales, de la cacería a la siembra consciente de las especies de plantas silvestres más buscadas cerca de los asentamientos. El contexto americano es singular por no contar con animales de tiro y pocas herramientas metálicas, llevando a los humanos a convertirse en la principal fuerza laboral. El fuego fue bastante usado para abrir espacios para los cultivos. Más que el cultivo del ager predominó el cultivo de una huerta, en donde continuamente se experimentó y se introdujeron plantas de varias partes hasta construir un sistema de policultivo. La necesidad de producir todo en una superficie reducida, contribuyó a su éxito agronómico y nutricional, y a su difusión a través del trópico precolombino. El manejo individual (en la siembra y cosecha) de las plantas tuvo como consecuencia el gigantismo y una variación extraordinaria de formas y colores de frutos y semillas. La propia geografía física propició la diversidad dentro y entre los sistemas. Por lo tanto, en contraste con otras partes del mundo, no se ve un centro de origen de los cultivos neotropicales. Varios de los sistemas agrícolas prehispánicos permitieron el auge demográfico y la especialización social, y desde allí las civilizaciones precolombinas conocidas. Algunos sistemas no pudieron mantener la fertilidad de los suelos o manejar las oscilaciones climáticas del Niño y sus civilizaciones terminaron. El entendimiento de la domesticación de las plantas americanas jamás ha sido tan importante como lo es ahora para seguir garantizando la seguridad alimentaria.";"Debouck, Daniel G.";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture";"Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina";"CGIAR";"2017-12-31";"es";"deforestation;food security";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security;Forest Landscape Restoration;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"013;005;PER";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/88242";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"91005"

"handle:10568/89207";"CIAT in Africa Roadmap 2017-2020";"";"Our goal is to provide the scientific basis for development investments and policies that promote more productive, profitable agriculture, and healthier diets at no environmental cost. Low-income, smallholder farmers face significant challenges across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). High population growth is coinciding with migration to the cities as younger populations seek out higher income-earning opportunities. Inadequate infrastructure and few markets for agricultural production in rural areas, for example, are leading to stagnated opportunities for smallholders. More people need diverse, nutritious food. This needs to be affordable and available to low-income, vulnerable people.
Opportunities to accelerate and make agricultural production more efficient exist. We can – and must – harness science and agricultural research for development to drive agricultural growth and contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), continental and national goals as envisaged under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and other strategic frameworks with which CIAT’s work is aligned.
In the last 50 years, CIAT has worked to improve livelihoods and make healthier, local foods available to more people, while protecting land resources and ecosystems. In doing so, our work in Africa has broadened from commodity-focused interventions to understanding interactions within the wider food system.
This Roadmap outlines four thematic areas that CIAT aims to address in Africa to make agricultural systems more resilient and efficient. These areas apply a sharper focus to specific opportunities and foster a holistic and cross-cutting approach to tackle research and development challenges.
The themes communicate our areas of strength, and outline opportunities for future engagement, to strengthen the impact pathway of our research.
The four thematic areas are: Leveraging markets through improved productivity and competitiveness; Agriculture for improved nutrition and health; Transforming farms and landscapes for sustainability; and Investment planning for resilient agriculture. Each is intended as a growth opportunity and value proposition for CIAT in Africa.
The themes inform our progress within today’s multi-layered research landscape and with our partners, the private sector, NGOs, governments, development partners, and farmers. Our partners have historically been central to our work in the region, and they remain so today. Much of our work is about presenting better solutions and decision-support tools for these partners, so they can make wiser investments in agriculture, prioritizing limited resources for a healthier, wealthier continent for our families today – and for our children to inherit.";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture";"International Center for Tropical Agriculture";"CGIAR";"2017-12-31";"en";"land use;farmers;agriculture;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"KEN;202;NGA;002;UGA;BDI;MDG;ZWE;TZA;SDN;014;GHA;ETH;MWI";"Reports & Research";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/89207";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"20";"";"92104"

The 54 species represent 24 fruit species, 24 timber species and 6 species used for soil fertility improvement. Suitability maps correspond to the baseline climate (1960-1990) and 2050 climates predicted for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Habitat was classified as suitable in future climates if a minimum of 12 out of 17 downscaled Global Circulation Models predicted suitable climates. Details of the methodology of ensemble suitability modelling with the BiodiversityR package are provided in the atlas.

The atlas was developed to support climate change oriented initiatives for diversification and conservation of forest genetic resources across Central America. Farmers, scientists and technicians can use the atlas to identify suitable and vulnerable areas for shade species and develop strategies for climate change adaptation.

This work has been possible by the financial support of the CGIAR research program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA; supported by the CGIAR Fund Donors); the CGIAR research program on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS; supported by the CGIAR Fund Donors) and HIVOS.

"handle:10568/89111";"Important knowledge gaps among pastoralists on causes and treatment of udder health problems in livestock in southern Ethiopia: results of qualitative investigation";"";"Background
Ethiopia has high prevalences of udder health problems including clinical and subclinical mastitis across production systems in different livestock species. Previous studies on udder health problems have largely focused on identification of mastitis causing microbial pathogens and associated risk factors. However, relatively little is known about the knowledge and beliefs of livestock keepers regarding udder health problems. An understanding of the beliefs on the other hand would facilitate effective communication between livestock keepers and animal health professionals. Therefore, this study aimed at exploring the knowledge and belief surrounding the causes, clinical signs and treatments for udder health problems in (agro-) pastoral communities in southern Ethiopia using qualitative investigation.

Results
The result showed that udder health problem, locally known as ‘dhukkuba muchaa’, which translates to ‘disease of teats’, was classified into three main types: (1) tick infestation (dirandisa), (2) swelling of udder often with pus discharge (nyaqarsa) and (3) acute mastitis caused by evil eye (buda) with ‘bloody milk’. Tick infestation was perceived to directly cause mechanical damage to udder tissue or to resulting in swelling leading to nyaqarsa. Our analysis also revealed the strong misperception that acute and severe swelling of udder was caused by evil eye. According to the pastoralists, cows with large udders in the late pregnancy are prone to evil eye infliction upon giving birth. The pastoralists often treat udder health problems by combining both modern and traditional methods. Removal of ticks by hand and acarcide application were the preferred methods for limiting tick infestation while swelling and evil eye cases were treated with antibiotics (e.g. oxytetracycline).

The study also revealed that specific herbs, only known by the herbalists, were used for traditional treatment of udder health. Although this information could not be divulged at the time, it should form the subject of further investigation. Traditional treatment for evil eye was often administered through nostrils, raising questions about its effectiveness.

Conclusion
The narration given by the pastoralists in associating tick infestation with udder health problems was compatible with existing scientific evidences. In this respect, such local knowledge can be better utilized for the educational messages targeting control and management of tick infestation in livestock. However, the misperception of causes for acute udder swelling as evil eye can be problematic as far as the application of appropriate treatment and management of the problem is concerned. The misperception can significantly impact the welfare of animals and highlights the need for capacity building of the pastoralists on the causes and treatment of udder health problems.";"Amenu, K.

"handle:10568/97604";"Managing aquifer recharge and sustaining groundwater use: developing a capacity building program for creating local groundwater champions";"";"Participatory groundwater management is increasingly being recognised for its ability to address the challenges of equity, efficiency and sustainability. It can particularly help with effective engagement at the grassroots level for monitoring, recharging and managing the groundwater as a common pool resource. The main aim of this article is to discuss the training and management process used and the lessons learnt from a participatory groundwater management project, titled Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustainable Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention (MARVI). In this project, researchers, rural development facilitators and local villagers worked together to initiate participatory groundwater monitoring in 11 villages from the Dharta and Meghraj watersheds in Rajasthan and Gujarat, India. The study involved educating villagers through an intensive program of capacity building, wherein the villagers who participated in the program were called Bhujal Jaankars (BJs), a Hindi word meaning ‘groundwater informed’. The BJs were trained in their local settings through relevant theory and practical exercises, so that they could perform a geo-hydrological evaluation of their area, monitor groundwater and share their findings and experiences with their village community. The study has highlighted that with a well-designed program of capacity building and on-going support through training and nurturing, BJs can play an important role in monitoring watertable depth and other data for estimating groundwater recharge, leading to a sharing of the groundwater information with the local village community to influence the sustainable use of groundwater. Overall they can act as local champions for groundwater futures. Further, this study has demonstrated that BJ capacity building can help to provide a scientific basis for village level groundwater dialogue and assist village communities and other stakeholders to improve their decision making regarding groundwater use, crop selection, agronomy, recharge strategies and other aspects of sustainable groundwater management. Although the BJ program has been successful and BJs can act as a valuable interface between local communities and other stakeholders managed aquifer recharge activities, there still exists some challenges to the BJ programme, such as the need for mechanisms and funding sources that will sustain the BJs over the longer term; wider acceptance of BJs among scientific communities and policy makers; and the acceptance of the role and involvements of BJs in natural resources management programs of the State and Central governments in India.";"Jadeja, J

"handle:10568/90970";"Soil quality – A critical review";"";"Sampling and analysis or visual examination of soil to assess its status and use potential is widely practiced from plot to national scales. However, the choice of relevant soil attributes and interpretation of measurements are not straightforward, because of the complexity and site-specificity of soils, legacy effects of previous land use, and trade-offs between ecosystem services. Here we review soil quality and related concepts, in terms of definition, assessment approaches, and indicator selection and interpretation. We identify the most frequently used soil quality indicators under agricultural land use. We find that explicit evaluation of soil quality with respect to specific soil threats, soil functions and ecosystem services has rarely been implemented, and few approaches provide clear interpretation schemes of measured indicator values. This limits their adoption by land managers as well as policy. We also consider novel indicators that address currently neglected though important soil properties and processes, and we list the crucial steps in the development of a soil quality assessment procedure that is scientifically sound and supports management and policy decisions that account for the multi-functionality of soil. This requires the involvement of the pertinent actors, stakeholders and end-users to a much larger degree than practiced to date.";"Bünemann, Else K.

"handle:10568/97557";"Feeding a productive dairy cow in western Kenya: environmental and socioeconomic impacts";"";"Send a Cow (SAC) is a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that has been working in Kenya since 1996. It focuses on groups of smallholder farmers, providing them with training in sustainable agriculture and improved animal management. SAC is mostly active in western Kenya, one of the country's most populated and poorest region. The population density for this region ranges from 337 to 1,300 inhabitants per km² with an average density of 590 people per km2 (Kenya Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 2001; KNBS, 2010). Over 50% of the people in this area are dependent on agriculture and live below the poverty line of US$1/day (Iruria et al., 2009; Makokha et al., 2007). In 2013, SAC started the “Wealth Creation Project” (WCP) in Busia, Kakamega, Siaya, and Bungoma Counties in the Western Province of Kenya. The project aims to increase the agri-production systems of 9,500 smallholder farming families by diversifying their diets and giving them an additional source of income.
Farmers are provided with training in animal management and sustainable agricultural practices throughout the project. After comprehensive trainings and farm asset evaluation, farmers were given livestock. The gift of one improved livestock head to each rural, poor family created wealth and security for them, contributing to wealth creation by improving the quality of life and offering a potential pathway out of poverty (Nicholson et al., 2003). The WCP adds to the increasing number of smallholder farmers who keep improved dairy cows as a source of income and financial security. In 2007, it was estimated that 99,000 smallholder dairy farmers in the Western Province were keeping about 192,300 improved dairy cattle (Muriuki, 2011).
Land has become the main limiting factor in this already densely populated region, due to continuous population growth and land fragmentation. The small land size per farm (1 acre on average), which is further subdivided in each generation, is a major obstacle to providing adequate energy and protein intake for a dairy cow and a household. Due to limited land size, farmers put most of the available land under food crops and dedicate little area to planted fodder. Researching on the land area that is necessary to adequately feed a productive dairy cow and a family is essential for effective decision making and for training the farmers in sustainable feed production and farm planning.
Therefore, SAC collaborated with CIAT in assessing the land requirement for a dairy cow under different feeding regimes and explored the trade-offs of these feeding strategies in terms of food vs. feed land requirements, environmental impacts, and profitability. This research field is a focus area in farming systems research and trade-off analysis, both areas where CIAT has expertise.";"Osele, Vivien

"handle:10568/81138";"Learning from REDD+: a response to Fletcher et al.";"";"Although REDD+ is approaching its 10th anniversary, major impacts in terms of reduced forest loss are hard to document. Conservation practitioners and scholars are therefore increasingly asking why REDD+ has not delivered more tangible results. A recent Comment in Conservation Biology by Fletcher et al. (2016) addresses this question. We agree with Fletcher et al. that REDD+ has been hyped in some circles, which has created unrealistic expectations among policy makers and forest dwellers alike. Yet, we argue that Fletcher et al. put forward an incomplete interpretation of the evolving REDD+ concept and practice and wrongly place the responsibility for lack of progress on the principles of payment for environmental services (PES) and on reliance on market-based instruments (MBIs), in part based on their misunderstanding of the PES concept.

Potential answers to the question of why REDD+ has not delivered more tangible results fall into 4 categories: REDD+ has not yet been implemented at the scale needed to make a difference, REDD+ has evolved from the initial PES vision to a modified version of previous and largely ineffective conservation efforts, REDD+ has been blocked by powerful actors interested in maintaining the status quo, and REDD+ is conceptually flawed in its design as a PES and MBI scheme. Fletcher et al. fail to fully appreciate the first 3 problems, overemphasize the presumed flaws in REDD+ as a PES design, and prepare the ground for the rise and fall of the next conservation fad (Redford et al. 2013). We believe that REDD+, although troubled, is not dead.";"Angelsen, Arild

Hence, measuring ecological complexity over space becomes crucial in macroecology and geography. Many geospatial tools have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate ecosystem complexity and its changes over space and time. Among these tools, free and open source options especially offer opportunities to guarantee the robustness of algorithms and reproducibility. In this paper we will summarize the most straightforward measures of spatial complexity available in the Free and Open Source Software GRASS GIS, relating them to key ecological patterns and processes.";"Rocchini, D.

Four hydrological characteristics – water yield, groundwater recharge, base flow and flow regulation – were determined and mapped throughout the basin for three 30-year time periods: 2020–2049, 2040–2069 and 2070–2099. Results were compared with a baseline period, 1983–2011. All four hydrological characteristics show steady increases under both RCPs for the entire basin but with considerable spatial heterogeneity and greater increases under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5. The results have important implications for the way water resources in the basin are managed. It is imperative that water managers and policy makers take into account the additional challenges imposed by climate change in operating built infrastructure.";"Muthuwatta, Lal";"";"";"CGIAR";"2018-12-31";"en";"natural resources management;water management;assessment;climate change";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"https://hdl.handle.net/10568/96602";"";"";"All rights reserved";"";"";"";"99963"

"handle:10568/81219";"Managing change to implement integrated urban water management in African cities";"";"With increasing pressures from global changes (urbanization, climate change, etc.), cities in Africa will experience difficulties in efficiently managing water resources. Most of the urbanization in Africa over the next 30 years will occur in fast-growing small towns that lack mature infrastructure. This offers a unique opportunity to implement innovative solutions based on integrated urban water management (IUWM). While IUWM approaches have been widely reported in the literature, their application has been limited. This paper describes the African Water Facility’s experience in applying the approach to three projects, in the Seychelles, Zimbabwe and Democratic Republic of Congo, which illustrate the types of challenges faced in different institutional frameworks and contexts (such as islands, a small town and a megacity). The paper identifies the critical issues for improving uptake and scaling up, including strong leadership, the commitment of government and the institutions involved, and a formal programme of capacity building and technical assistance.";"Bahri, A.

"handle:10568/81218";"Time-series cloud noise mapping and reduction algorithm for improved vegetation and drought monitoring";"";"Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) products are regularly used for vegetation monitoring missions and climate change analysis. However, satellite observation is affected by the atmospheric condition, cloud state and shadows introducing noise in the data. MODIS state flag helps in understanding pixel quality but overestimates the noise and hence its usability requires further scrutiny. This study has analyzed MODIS MOD09A1 annual data set over Sri Lanka. The study presents a simple and effective noise mapping method which integrates four state flag parameters (i.e. cloud state, cloud shadow, cirrus detected, and internal cloud algorithm flag) to estimate Cloud Possibility Index (CPI). Usability of CPI is analyzed along with NDVI for noise elimination. Then the gaps generated due to noise elimination are reconstructed and performance of the reconstruction model is assessed over simulated data with five different levels of random gaps (10–50%) and four different statistical measures (i.e. Root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean bias error, and mean absolute percentage error). The sample-based analysis over homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels have revealed that CPI-based noise elimination has increased the detection accuracy of number of growing cycle from 45–60% to 85–95% in vegetated regions. The study cautions that usage of time-series NDVI data without proper cloud correction mechanism would result in wrong estimation about spatial distribution and intensity of drought, and in our study 50% of area is wrongly reported to be under drought though there was no major drought in 2014.";"Mondal, S.
