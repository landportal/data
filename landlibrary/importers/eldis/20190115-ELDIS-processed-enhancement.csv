eldis:A28295;Carrying capacity, rangeland degredation and livestock development for the communal rangelands of Botswana;;Recent arguments have stated that the new livestock development policy will carry a high social cost, that the reality of range degradation in Botswana has been ignored, and that there is no basis for assuming that de-stocking would decrease the productivity of rangeland. This paper attempts to address some of these issues.Paper argues that confusion in the debate arises from the role of science in providing evidence and proof, conflicting theories of degradation, differences between definitions of degradation, assumptions about thresholds of degradation, and over the estimation of the impacts of stocking policy.  Each of these issues are dealt with. ;R.

eldis:A65575;Pastoralists and wildlife conservation in western China: collaborative management within protected areas on the Tibetan Plateau;;"Background Pastoralists have long inhabited vast areas of western China, including the Tibetan Plateau region. Their traditional land use practices and cultural conservation ethic have helped to protect the natural resource base upon which they depend and the wildlife that co-exist with them in the grassland landscapes. However, in a rapidly changing socio-economic environment, including significant expansion of the protected area system and regional comprehensive development plans, local communities do not always have an evident voice in the conservation and development dialogues that closely affect their lives.

With introduction and development of collaborative management - that is, a partnership between local communities, nature reserve authorities and other stakeholders - a landscape-level approach to conservation is now being modelled in Qinghai Province. Central to effective co-management are bi-directional relationships. There are also a wealth of direct and indirect services that may be provided by pastoralists under co-management, and in the compensation and payment options available to them in return for their critical services.

As this paper concludes, the contributions of pastoralists to wildlife conservation efforts are significant, but up to now insufficiently recognised. New insights regarding the relationship between pastoralists and wildlife conservation - including the potential role of community ecotourism, the development of local herders' cooperatives and of trust funds, and the need for greater clarity in local regulatory frameworks - are provided herein, with presentation of specific experiences and lessons learned from a project piloted in the headwaters of the Yangtze River over the past decade. A fuller, richer model of co-management is recommended.

eldis:A35706;Peri-urban water conflicts: supporting dialogue and negotiation;;"As cities expand, a key challenge is securing water supplies for urban populations and disposing of pollution while minimising impacts on peri-urban communities and the environment.  This book describes the conflicts, dialogues and negotiations underway in peri-urban areas of many cities in the South. 
Based on three case studies from Sao Paulo (Brazil), Cochabamba (Bolivia) and Chennai (India), it reveals how people and communities without good access to water and sanitation services depend upon alternatives to conventional service delivery from utilities, and explores how these arrangements can be supported. In particular, the case studies explore how stakeholders can be brought together to find better solutions to infrastructural development in peri-urban areas, and how research can provide information, tools and approaches to facilitate these processes. 
The research is based on the Negowat project, a four year research initiative undertaken by a consortium of research and non-governmental organisations from Europe, Latin America and India. 
The authors find that, there are several similarities as well as important differences across these three widely differing cities. They find that: 

    in each city, there are huge problems in service delivery to expanding populations in the peri-urban areas. These are probably insurmountable in the short term due to existing patterns of development in the cities
    in each case, however, innovative, locally-inspired and alternative solutions have emerged to fill the gaps in formal systems 
    sometimes these have clear overall benefits such as the generally well-performing community-managed water systems in Cochabamba, but sometimes they are associated with severe negative impacts, for example, the over-exploitation and inefficiencies associated with private water markets and tankering in Chennai 
    in the three case study processes, researcher-initiated and supported negotiation processes were found to contribute to the search for less painful, less conflictive or more inclusive urbanisation.

eldis:A70571;Environmental livelihood security in Southeast Asia and Oceania: a water-energy-food-livelihoods nexus approach for spatially assessing change;;"This document addresses the need for explicit inclusion of livelihoods within the environment nexus (water-energy-food security). The authors present a conceptualisation of ‘environmental livelihood security’, which combines the nexus perspective with sustainable livelihoods. The geographical focus of this paper is Southeast Asia and Oceania, which the authors highlight is a region currently wrought by the impacts of a changing climate. Climate change is the primary external forcing mechanism on the environmental livelihood security of communities in Southeast Asia and Oceania which, therefore, forms the applied crux of this paper. The paper provides a primer for using geospatial information to develop a spatial framework to enable geographical assessment of environmental livelihood security across the region. It concludes by linking the value of this research to ongoing sustainable development discussions, and for influencing policy agendas.

eldis:A12769;The impact of property rights on households’ investment, risk coping, and policy preferences: evidence from China;;This paper addresses the issue of land security and sustainability.  The paper tackles the assumption that, in the case of China, giving farmers more secure land rights would undermine the function of land as a social safety net and, as a consequence, not be sustainable or command broad support.The report draws on data from three provinces, one of which had adopted a policy to increase security of tenure in advance of the others.  It finds that greater tenure security, especially if combined with transferability of land, had a positive impact on agricultural investment and, within the time frame considered, led neither to an increase in inequality of land distribution nor a reduction in households’ ability to cope with exogenous shocks. Household support for more secure property rights is increased by their access to other insurance mechanisms, suggesting some role of land as a safety net. At the same time, past exposure to this type of land right has a much larger impact quantitatively, suggesting that a large part of the resistance to changed property rights arrangements disappears as household familiarity with such rights increases.The paper concludes that implementation of a policy that gradually increases tenure security as well as the transferability of land will yield economic benefits without obvious negative social consequence. Such a policy would  be a logical extension of the initiatives started with the adoption of the household responsibility system and geared towards advancing economic development in China’s rural areas. ;"K.

eldis:A29838;Negotiating rights: access to land in the cotton zone, Burkina Faso;;"The paper examines how derived rights have evolved through settlement, loan, rental or purchase contracts and how these arrangements have developed as a result of national policy and socio-economic history. It goes on to examine how the unique circumstances of ""established"" and ""pioneer"" farming areas show differing patterns of change in arrangements over time. The author then looks at the wider questions of how arrangements affect security of tenure and scrutinises the relationship between official land rights bodies, government policy and the informal structure of contracts.The author concludes that the driving force behind differing contract strategies is the search for a secure livelihood and that this always overrides law and the enforcement of policy. Tenure policies must be integrated within broader development policies that have an understanding of tenure practices. ";L.

eldis:A70574;Planting the foundations of a post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting framework;;"This paper presents possible elements of a long-term international vision for land sector reporting and accounting. The vision is of a multi-dimensional land sector reporting and accounting framework that is applicable to all countries and increases in comprehensiveness over time. The overarching objective of the framework is to build trust between Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by tracking progress in implementation of mitigation contributions in the land sector. The paper argues that two of the most important dimensions could be the coverage of accounting for key sources and sinks and the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting. It outlines possible short-term steps for COP 20, COP 21 and 2016-2020 that could put Parties on a pathway towards realising the long-term vision.

eldis:A75267;The establishment of Korea land information system (KLIS);;"The Korea Land Information System (KLIS) aims to provide information necessary for land policy establishment promptly and accurately. This system manages accurate information on land use zoning designated by land use regulations and provides it to government agencies, local governments, and people. KLIS manages and provides specifically the land information database to prevent duplication of investment among agencies and to effectively manage the land by securing the compatibility of data sets.

There were many difficulties during the construction process of KLIS. The first of these difficulties was to produce a serial cadastral map with single cadastral maps, because of different scales of cadastral map in the characteristics of land parcels. Secondly, there was a discrepancy in each different zoning map. Thirdly, the flawed legal system for data sharing in land policies and lastly, the central government experienced conflicts to initiate the KLIS incorporation. In spite of these challenges, the Korean government was able to establish the KLIS.

The KLIS performed better than anticipated and its effects were both tangible and intangible. Enhanced public services through the Internet have been welcomed by the public, and are helping to save time and costs. ";"Jong Taek Park

eldis:A26526;Taking the bull by the horns: NGOs and pastoralists in coalition;;Such is the vagary of rainfall throughout Africa's rangelands that almost all pastoral communities face cycles of good and hardship years. During good years herders increase and diversify their herds, whilst consecutive hardship years or `pastoral drought,' human and livestock disease, or livestock theft may result in large livestock losses and the consequent temporary collapse of household food production. Seldom, however, do environmental factors alone conspire to overwhelm the pastoral production of entire ethnic groups, since pastoralists have `drought responses,' including mobile and adaptive grazing strategies, livestock and cereal exchanges, the establishment of diverse herds, herd splitting, and non-pastoral activities (agriculture, wage labour etc.).Underpinning these systems is often a network of affinal and `stock-friendships,' in which each herding family is involved in the reciprocal giving and receiving of livestock. In these ways, pastoral households are able to minimise the impact of crisis years, rebuild and maintain viable herds.The article recommends:the documentation and explanation of customary land-rights, in particular with regard to womenthe registration of pastoral land-rightsthe summarisation of national statutory laws affecting pastoral land-tenurethe exploration of ways of reconciling and integrating customary and statutory tenurethe provision of legal aid to fight test cases and the support of legal aid camps or clinics in pastoral areasthe incorporation of legal themes into adult education and literacy programmes for pastoralists ;A.

eldis:A100778;Current challenges of implementing land - use and land - cover change  in climate assessments;;Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) represents one of the key drivers of global environmental change. However, the processes and drivers of anthropogenic land-use activity are still overly simplistically implemented in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) and Earth System Models (ESMs), whose published results are used in major assessments of processes and impacts of global environmental change such as the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the absence of coupled models of climate, land use and biogeochemical cycles to explore land use – climate interactions across spatial scales, information on LULCC is currently provided as exogenous data from the land-use change modules of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to ESMs and DGVMs, while data from dedicated land-use change models (LUCMs) are rarely considered. In this article, we discuss major uncertainties and existing shortcomings of current implementation strategies originating in both LULCC data-provider and LULCC data-user communities.The authors identify, based on literature review and the analysis of empirical and modeled LULCC data, three major challenges related to LULCC representation, which are currently not or insufficiently accounted for: (1) provision of consistent, harmonized LULCC time series spanning from historical reconstructions to future projections while accounting for uncertainties due to different land-use modeling approaches, (2) accounting for sub-grid processes and bi-directional changes (gross changes) across spatial scales and (3) the allocation strategy of LULCC at the grid cell level in ESMs and DGVMs.Based on these three challenges, the paper discusses the reasons that hamper the development of implementation strategies that sufficiently account for uncertainties in the land-use modeling process and conclude that both providers and users of LULCC data products often miss appropriate knowledge of the requirements and constraints of one another’s models, thus leading to large discrepancies between the representation of LULCC data and processes in both communities. The authors propose to focus future research on the joint development and evaluation of enhanced LULCC time series, which account for the diversity of LULCC modeling and increasingly include empirically based information about sub-grid processes and land-use transition trajectories. ;;;Earth System Dynamics;eldis;01/01/2016;en;"climate change;land;assessment";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A100778;http://www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net/esd-2016-39/esd-2016-39.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net%2Fesd-2016-39%2Fesd-2016-39.pdf;CC-BY;Open - CC - Attribution (CCBY);;"Climate change Forestry;land - use harmonization;Land issues;land - climate  interaction;Agriculture and food;Earth System model;Climate change;global vegetation model;land - use  allocation;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;gross transitions"
eldis:A25390;Indonesia's cocoa boom : hands - off policy encourages smallholder dynamism;;Indonesia's cocoa output, produced mainly by smallholders on the island of Sulawesi, increased a phenomenal 26 percent a year (average, compounded) between 1980 and 1994. The government's hands-off policy was an important factor in this rapid expansion of output.This case study of Sulawesi's cocoa market is a counterpoint to investigations of highly regulated markets --- agricultural and otherwise. The Indonesian island's rapid expansion surprised the world cocoa market, especially because it came mostly from smallholders.Akiyama and Nishio examined the smallholders' production and marketing systems and the government policies implemented for smallholders to identify any policy lessons that might be useful for other countries. They found:The following factors contributed to the rapid expansion: the availability of suitable land, low production costs, a highly competitive marketing system (a result of the government's hands-off policy or limited government interventions), relatively good transport infrastructure, favorable macroeconomic policies, and the smallholders' entrepreneurship. Until the recent imposition of a value-added tax, Indonesia's government left cocoa marketing and distribution freer of government interventions than many other commodities --- in part because the Indonesian Cocoa Association recommended such nonintervention. Other commodities were affected by direct involvement of the National Logistics Agency, price controls, and exclusive trade licensing requirements. As a result of the competitive cocoa marketing system, the farmgate price of cocoa in Indonesia is about 90 percent of the f.o.b. price --- a much higher share than cocoa produced in other countries and than other commodities produced in Indonesia. This relatively free marketing and distribution system must be maintained for cocoa to develop further. Some general government policies have benefited the cocoa subsector as well as others. Exchange rates have been kept competitive, for example, no export tax has been imposed, and it has been government policy to build basic infrastructure in the outer islands.Several issues must be addressed for cocoa to be further developed: the quality of cocoa, the adding up problem (export revenues not increasing in proportion to export quantities, because of the price depressing effect of increased exports), the recently imposed value-added tax, the cocoa podborer, export marketing, research, retribution, local processing, environmental problems, and government interventions now being discussed for the cocoa sector.Government and industry must also resist the natural temptation for current players to become more conservative, to protect their interests.This paper --- a joint product of the Commodity Policy and Analysis Unit, International Economics Department, and the Agriculture Operations Division, Country Department III, East Asia and Pacific --- was presented at the conference, Building on Success: Maximizing the Gains from Deregulation, held in Jakarta, Indonesia, April 26  28, 1995.

eldis:A11269;The Kimberley Process: the case for proper monitoring;;This paper describes the outcomes of the Kimberley Process, which aims to create a certification system for rough diamonds, so excluding illicit diamonds, which fuel conflict, from the global diamond trade.The author focuses on the provisions the process has made for monitoring certified diamonds. He provides an overview of the monitoring provisions of the Kimberley Process as agreed at its March 2002 Ottawa meeting. The paper compares these with the monitoring provisions in other international agreements, and rates them against the problems the Kimberley Process aims to resolve, arguing that much stronger measures will be required if the agreement is to be credible and effective.The document contains a proposal for ‘essential elements’ of an effective and credible Kimberley process monitoring system. And it concludes that if such a system is not adopted, the Kimberley Process will create a false sense of security, allowing conflict diamonds to continue entering the system, ultimately placing the entire diamond industry at risk.

eldis:A61985;REDD+ Politics in the Media: A Case Study From Indonesia;;This working paper examines how Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been framed in Indonesia’s media. The report’s findings are based on content analysis of three national newspapers and a series of expert interviews. It is argued that Indonesia’s REDD+ discourse revolves primarily around land use, where REDD+ conservation is pitted against economic growth fuelled by land use change. Media analysis demonstrates that the Ministry of Forestry and Environment dominates debate at the national level, but their land use objectives diverge from other ministries. It is also asserted that NGOs are split over the capacity for REDD+ to deliver genuinely equitable outcomes. Concerns are raised over the extent to which journalists are able to critically engage with the REDD+ discourse, owing to its technical nature. The report ends by concluding that a broad cross-section of society has engaged with REDD+, but some voices are louder than others. ;T.

eldis:A73899;Public overseas investments: ensuring respect for and protecting legitimate land tenure rights: rapid evidence assessment;;"This rapid evidence assessment (REA) investigates how public overseas investments supported by developed country governments respect legitimate land tenure rights, especially in countries without a strong system for protecting existing tenure rights. The REA assesses material from the limited number of studies (20) available about donor-supported investment projects involving land. Most are from African countries, but the evidence also includes cases from Afghanistan, Guatemala and Cambodia. Agricultural projects predominate, while two cases look at the impact of road projects on local land rights.

The studies suggest that:


	most foreign direct investment (FDI) actors are aware of the need to accommodate local land rights. Nevertheless, evidence from a wider body of material (see Appendix 5) relating to FDI-based and private sector projects shows that most large land-based investments are failing to take into account either legitimate local rights and/or local livelihoods impacts
	where a public donor is present – either directly funding or promoting a project – and is advocating the use of instruments, like the FAO Voluntary guidelines on the good governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests (VGGT) and the Principles for responsible investments in agriculture and food systems (RAI)1, investment projects can include effective mitigation measures and/or be designed to produce real benefits for those holding legitimate rights over the land used
	inclusive business and investment models (i.e. models which engage communities fully and allow sharing of the investment benefits while respecting community land needs) are available which bring local people fully into the project process and turn it into an opportunity for social development and life-enhancing changes
	donors must be fully informed about legitimate local rights at the design and appraisal stages of new projects, and cannot assume that government or private sector partners will rigorously adhere to agreed approaches
	there is a need for more research into how projects, funded or supported by donors, can be designed and implemented to ensure respect for and protect legitimate local tenure rights

eldis:A18752;Pumping poverty: Britain's Department for International Development and the oil industry;;"UK aid money is creating an ""oil curse"" for developing economies, according to this new report published by Friends of the Earth, Plan B and Platform Research. Pumping Poverty accuses DFID of an aid policy that is incoherent, fails the people it is designed to help, compromises the department's mandate for poverty alleviation, undermines the aims of the Millennium Development Goals, and further undermines UK efforts to fight climate change.Specifically the report highlights the adverse environmental and social impacts or ""oil curse"" which, it argues, often accompany the discovery of oil in a developing country. At a local level, oil production can have an adverse effect on local communities, with pollution affecting water supplies, farm land and air quality. Nationally, the discovery of oil can harm the economy, with investment in oil undermining other sectors, disrupting growth and potentially weakening democracy.The report uses case studies detailing these impacts to question DFID's continued support for oil projects through direct grants and the approval of loans through the World Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The use of development aid to support such projects, they argue, distorts the energy market in favour of oil and provides essential leverage for private finance. The report argues that in order to prevent catastrophic climate change such hidden subsidies need to end.The report also questions the conflicting role of DFID as a partner in maintaining UK energy security. This they argue leads to the use of development aid to support the goals of the UK's oil industry and is explicitly aimed at enhancing the UK economy rather than maximising poverty alleviation in developing countries.Among the key recommendations of the report are the following:phase out over a limited timeframe all bilateral development aid for the oil industrypress for a similar phase-out in multilateral banks and other funding institutionsrigorously assess the poverty alleviation and sustainable development impacts of overseas development aid for the oil industry until a phase out is implementedproactively support sustainable renewable energy strategies in developing countriesThe report calls for:a UK Parliamentary investigation into the impacts on poverty of DFID’s support for oil developmentthe filing by DFID in the UK House of Commons Library of its internal reviews and reports on effectiveness of its projects to datethe publication by DFID of all of its votes and positions on projects seeking support from multilateral development banksongoing Parliamentary scrutiny of DFID’s ‘due diligence’ on specific projects, and the quality of its internal record-keeping ";"L.

eldis:A39514;Land and decentralisation in Senegal;;"Land and decentralisation policies in Senegal have been closely linked since the country became independent in 1960. Although local governments manage public lands and participate in the management of special areas, the actual degree popular participation in land and decentralisation policies occurs strongly depends on the rights granted to local communities and governments and the available human and financial resources. This paper explores these issues and discusses their effect on decentralisation and land management in Senegal.
 
    The authors explore local authorities' representativeness as well as the human and financial resources available to them. They highlight three points: decentralisation policies should be intensified to foster sustainable local government; infrastructure, public services and support for economic activities are needed and; the translation of legislative advances into action has been too slow.
     
        The security of land tenure in rural areas remains insufficient despite the national land law of 1964. This situation - which undermines the necessary modernisation of rural Senegal - is due to several factors: 
        
            political authorities and administrations have been slow in translating legislation into action
            farmers have never accepted the abolition of their customary rights
            neither the State nor local governments have sufficient human or financial resources to apply the law
            rural councils are unable to manage national land in a sustainable manner
            there is a growing number of illegal land sales and rentals 
        
        Attempts to reform land rights have also failed due to the State's refusal to recognise the social nature of land policy and to include stakeholders in the decision making process. The authors recommend that any successful land policy should: 
        
            reverse the fragmentation of family farms
            give local governments the human and financial resources they require to manage land and natural resources sustainably
            address problems associated with urbanisation
            open rural land to economic use by the growing urban population
            balance the ensuing loss of land for the rural population by an inflow of financial capital to rural areas

eldis:A62358;GRAIN — Squeezing Africa dry: behind every land grab is a water grab;;Food cannot be grown without water. In Africa, one in three people endure water scarcity and climate change will make things worse. Building on Africa’s highly sophisticated indigenous water management systems could help resolve this growing crisis, but these very systems are being destroyed by large-scale land grabs amidst claims that Africa's water is abundant, under-utilised and ready to be harnessed for export-oriented agriculture. GRAIN looks behind the current scramble for land in Africa to reveal a global struggle for what is increasingly seen as a commodity more precious than gold or oil - water. ;;;GRAIN;eldis;01/01/2012;en;"land;climate change;research;environment;food security";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";;"ETH;MLI;CMR;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A62358;http://www.grain.org/article/entries/4516-squeezing-africa-dry-behind-every-land-grab-is-a-water-grab.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grain.org%2Farticle%2Fentries%2F4516-squeezing-africa-dry-behind-every-land-grab-is-a-water-grab.pdf;;;;"Environment;author:GRAIN;theme:water;Climate change;Water in climate change;research;Agriculture and food;Food security;tfmimport;Environment and water"
eldis:A70749;Kailash sacred landscape conservation initiative – Feasibility assessment report;;"The Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL) spreads across a vast region that includes remote portions of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China (TAR China) and contiguous areas of Nepal and India. This area is historically, ecologically, and culturally interconnected; it is the source of four of Asia’s most important rivers, and at the heart of this landscape is the sacred Mount Kailash, revered by millions of people in Asia and throughout the world. The region and its people are highly vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation, as well as threats associated with ongoing globalisation processes and accelerating development. The Kailash Sacred Landscape Conservation Initiative (KSLCI) is an attempt on the part of the three neighbouring countries to join hands to help preserve the unique biological diversity, the many ecosystem goods and services, and the value-based cultural heritage of one of the most revered and sacred landscapes in the world. The present report is a summarised synthesis of three individual Country Feasibility Assessment Reports, based on extensive field work and consultations aimed at delineating the target landscape and preparing a needs analysis for the KSL in general, and the KSLCI in particular.

eldis:A37675;Crisis in Kenya: land, displacement and the search for 'durable solutions';;"This policy brief explores the importance of land issues in forced displacement in Kenya, drawing out their implications for current humanitarian and early recovery interventions in the wake of the violence and displacement that followed the 2007 elections. Key messages nclude: 

    current post-election displacement in Kenya is not a new phenomenon but a recurring trend linked to unresolved land grievances, in a context of poor governance and socio-economic insecurity. This is of concern to humanitarians as the failure to understand the dynamics involved and the implications for recovery can exacerbate tensions and jeopardise attempts to resolve the crisis 
    humanitarians need to engage with land specialists to ensure that their programming not only avoids exacerbating tensions, but is also consistent with efforts to address the structural causes of conflict 
    return, relocation and local integration processes should not be promoted as durable solutions in the absence of serious attempts to resolve land-related grievances. If durable solutions are to be found, programmes must take account of those who were forced to move in earlier waves of displacement 
    the government’s urgency in encouraging internally displaced persons (IDPs) to return despite continued political uncertainty and insecurity raises clear protection concerns. This includes both physical security and wider issues to do with rights, community reconciliation and sustainable access to the means of subsistence
    in the absence of political progress and stability, urbanisation is likely to accelerate as displaced people seek alternative livelihoods 

The bried concludes that well-informed advocacy, which incorporates land tenure expertise, is required to encourage the government to meet its obligations to ensure that the conditions for return are in place. If such processes are to represent a truly durable solution, it argues that they must be accompanied by an acknowledgement of historical grievances and the need for reconciliation processes. In the absence of such change, it is imperative that the humanitarian community monitors the fate of IDPs after their return, to ensure that their rights are protected and their needs met.

The workshop was based on international, national and regional experiences, principles and practices related to dryland management and combating desertification to the development of community driven processes. The workhop’s three main objectives were:to promote UNCCD–NAP implementation for combating desertification and enhance drylands management for improved Pastoral Area Development (PAD)to enhance the understanding and the awareness about UNCCD-NAP at federal level and to strengthen the partnership among all concerned bodies and in particular those at federal levelto increase the involvement of all concerned agencies and in particular the Pastoral Affairs Standing Committee (PASC) and the Natural Resources Development and Environmental Protection Standing Committee (NRDEPSC) in the UNCCD-NAP implementation.Major summary recommendations based on the various workshop sessions, plenary and group work report discussions include:no new policies are needed, as there are already several policies for starting and promoting pastoralist development programmessome related policies require revisiting, upgrading to include and promote pastoralist development and drylands managementeffective coordination and harmonisation among the various organisations working on UNCCD-NAP and other pastoralist development programmes should be encouragedintensify institutional and organisational capacity building including womens' empowerment in pastoral areaspeople with the technical know-how should be assigned to provide necessary awareness to the regionsmembers of Parliament will follow up the present status of the NAP in addition to accelerating their endorsement at their respective national and regional levels. ;"Y.

It also present findings following attendance at the hearings in  the trial of Ferhat Kaya, a human rights defender who was detained and allegedly tortured by police officers as a result of his work with BTC-affected villagers.Regarding the pipeline project the report finds that:serious concerns, particularly relating to human rights abuses, expropriation of land, labour violations, and serious failures in quality control during construction, have been raised by affected peoples, experts, pipeline workers, non-governmental organisations and the project’s own monitoring reportsthroughout much of its time in the field, the Mission was subject to police surveillance; and this use of police power only serves to intimidate affected villagers and others seeking independently to monitor and provide information about the projectthe human rights reforms implemented by the Turkish government in advance of its EU accession application seem to have had little impact in the Northeast region, perhaps because of a relative lack of attention from national and international human rights monitorsthe project seems to be implemented in breach of agreed standards, particularly those relating to land acquisition, potentially placing the project in violation of host country law, project loan conditions and the European Convention on Human Rights.Regarding the court hearing the report finds that:the trial of the  police officers on such serious charges was concluded in three short hearings with no apparent detailed questioning of the police officers by either the prosecution or the trial judgethe trial judge did not exercise her powers to investigate further the allegations after the Public Prosecutor suddenly expressed his request to acquit the police officersthe defendant was not given an opportunity to question or have questioned the complainant in the case against him.The report recommends that, in the future, the International Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Export Credit Agencies take full account of the political and human rights contexts in which projects will be implemented, including the implications of this context for adherence with required standards. It also recommends that the International Financial Institutions (IFls) explicitly screen projects for their potential human rights impacts.

eldis:A63110;The future of environmental sustainability in the Taita Hills, Kenya: assessing potential impacts of agricultural expansion and climate change;;The indigenous cloud forests in the Taita Hills, Kenya, have suffered substantial degradation due to agricultural expansion. Currently, only one per cent of the original forested area remains preserved. Furthermore, climate change imposes an imminent threat for local economy and environmental sustainability. In such circumstances, elaborating tools to conciliate socio-economic growth and natural resources conservation is an enormous challenge. This article aims to tackle essential aspects for understanding the ongoing agricultural activities in the area and their environmental consequences. An alternative method is proposed to reduce uncertainties and costs for estimating agricultural water demand. The main characteristic of this approach is the use of satellite data to overcome data availability limitations. The study results indicate that if current trends persist, agricultural areas will occupy roughly 60 per cent of the area by 2030, increasing irrigation requirement significantly. ;E.

eldis:A21377;Some outstanding issues in the debate on external promotion of land privatisation;;Since the early 1990s, the dominant consensus in the debate on land rights reform in sub-Saharan Africa has been that external interventions to privatise land rights are usually inappropriate and likely to remain so. This article suggests that two elements in the debate - the scope for varying adjudication criteria, procedures and support systems in order to enhance equity, and the influence of a region's agro-ecological and socioeconomic characteristics on the impacts of tenure change – merit further attention.Drawing on illustrative evidence from eastern Kenya, the article urges a shift towards a more pragmatic approach, sensitive to the diversity of both physical and socio-economic conditions within which tenure systems operate. The results suggest, among others, that in countries with a diversity of land-use systems and agronomic potential, uniform impacts from privatisation across regions are unlikely. As a result, whether and in what form privatisation is appropriate is likely to vary. National land policies should ideally contain sufficient flexibility to allow for variation in the form and timing of privatisation across regions. The examples  of both unpredicted outcomes of privatisation and outcomes which have not been based on the assumed underlying causal relationships, each indicate a need for further region-specific research.

eldis:A67472;Diagnosis of farming systems in the agroforestry for livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Northwestern Viet Nam project;;"The Agroforestry for Livelihoods of Smallholder farmers in Northwestern Viet Nam project (2011-2016) focuses on agroforestry trials on farms in the northwestern mountainous region of the country. The objective of the study was to make an inventory of the current upland farming systems and identify key strengths and weaknesses of each system, including economic efficiency. The farming system diagnosis was based on participatory assessments and focus group discussions and in- depth interviews with 45 project ‘farmer co-operators’ in 17 villages in Yen Bai, Son La and Dien Bien provinces.

The inventory identified over 20 different farming systems. However, regardless of agro-eco-zones and ethnicity, the predominant land use on upland slopes was mono-cultivation of staple crops. Over 90% of the farmer co-operators grew maize, which was also the main source of income for 82%. The main drawback of this system was declining soil fertility and yields. In addition, upland farmers’ profits were generally low. Profits were lower at higher elevations. This was because 1) in response to declining soil fertility, increased amounts of fertilizers were applied but the productivity failed to compensate for increasing production costs; 2) local varieties of hill rice and maize seem to have degenerated; 3) farmers sold unprocessed grains and tubers at low, and volatile, prices because their market access and storage capacity was limited; and 4) the estimated labour costs in this study might be overestimated for distant fields. Farmers, therefore, wanted to find alternative farming systems; however, few were aware of appropriate tree based conservation farming practices.

This study identified several potential agroforestry models, for example, a combination of staple crops for short-term income, grass strips for protection from soil erosion and feed, and trees for medium to longer term income. The findings of the study will help identify agroforestry systems with potential for wider adoption and will lay the groundwork for the design or redesign of effective agroforestry research in the region.

eldis:A11349;The importance of land tenure to poverty eradication and sustainable development in Africa:  Summary of findings;;This paper draws out the key links between land tenure and poverty eradication. The author argues that  in  countries where land distribution remains highly inequitable, effectively designed and targeted,  it could be a key component of anti-poverty strategies, but significant complementary measures, notably agrarian support services, are also required to achieve real impacts, together with investments in employment and economic diversification. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, clarification of tenure rules, and the development of transparent, decentralised systems for land administration and dispute resolution, can also improve security, land access and provide a basis for sound resource management by and for the poor.  Suitable approaches  can often be based on existing customary institutions for land management, and evolving customary practice. ;J.

eldis:A75809;Realities of the watershed management approach: the Magat watershed experience;;"This paper aims to showcase the experience of the Magat (Philippines) watershed in the implementation of the watershed management approach. Magat watershed was declared as a forest-reservation area through Proclamation No. 573 on June 26, 1969 because of its great importance to human survival and environmental balance in the region. The Magat case demonstrates the important role that ‘champions’ like the local government unit (LGU) could play in managing the country’s watersheds. With the Nueva Viscaya province constituting 97% of the Magat watershed, the provincial government was committed to provide a strong management support system to the watershed. This involved interplay of critical elements, i.e., favorable policy and political environment, enabling social and institutional mechanisms, adequate financial support, and capable and committed actors and players.

The management approach adopted in Nueva Vizcaya treated the watershed as a ‘lifeshed’ where human concerns are connected with land and water resources. It was premised on ‘managing people first’ to relate society’s interests to the use of watershed resources. The provincial government was able to harness various stakeholders’ participation and tap technical and financial support. It provided incentives for people to join in participatory management schemes and to adopt conservation practices. The ‘feeling of control and sense of ownership’ served as ‘lifelines’ for individuals and organizations to sustain the watershed.

Reports of violence and intimidation have obscured the reality that formal procedures used to settle black farmers in model villages bear a striking resemblance to earlier colonial procedures. Whilst colonial myths about African farmers as subsistence oriented and inefficient live on, evidence from south-eastern Zimbabwe suggests that the reforms have benefited some poor black farmers ;"Joseph Chaumba

eldis:A25306;Adjustment and poverty in Mexican agriculture: how farmers' wealth affects supply response;;"By and large, it appears that the goals of agricultural reform are being met in Mexico. But measures such as decoupling income supports and price supports or reorienting research and extension could help farmers who cannot afford access to machinery and purchased inputs and services.Lopez, Nash, and Stanton report the results of a study of Mexican farm households using 1991 survey data and a smaller resurvey of some of the same households in 1993.One study goal was to empirically examine the relationship between assets and the output supply function. Using a production model focusing on capital as a productive input, they found that both the supply level and the responsiveness (elasticities) to changing input and output prices tend to depend on the farmer's net assets and on how productive assets are used. Regression analysis using data from the surveys shows that farmers who use productive assets such as machinery tend to be positively responsive to price changes, while those with no access to such assets are not.Another study goal was to monitor the condition of Mexican farmers in a rapidly changing policy environment. The 1991 survey data suggest that farmers with more limited use of capital inputs (the ""lowCI"" group) were more likely to grow principally corn and to grow fewer crops, on average, than the others. They also had more problems getting credit and were less likely to use purchased inputs, such as seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, or to use a tractor to prepare the soil. They tended to be less well educated, and their land tended to be of lower quality.Results from the panel data showed conditions generally improving for the average farmer in the sample area between 1991 and 1993, during a period when agricultural reforms were implemented. Cropping patterns were more diversified, the average size of land holdings increased, the average farmer received more credit (in real terms), more farm households earned income from off farm work, and more farmers used purchased inputs. Asset ownership and educational attainment also improved modestly.The very small lowCI group in this sample fared as well as, or better than, the other groups. True, their level of educational achievement fell, and fewer of them had off farm income than in 1991. But their use of credit, irrigation, machinery, and purchased inputs increased more than for other groups.The limited data are not proof of a causal link, but the fact that the goals are being met should at least ensure that adverse conditions are not undermining reform.Farmers that lacked access to productive assets did not respond as well to incentives or take advantage of the opportunities presented by reform and may need assistance, particularly to get access to credit markets. There may be a good argument for decoupling income supports from price supports for farmers, since income payments that are independent of the vagaries of production could provide a more stable signal of creditworthiness than price supports do.Possibly reorienting research and extension services more to the needs of loci producers could also improve the efficiency with which the sector adjusts to new incentives.Hypotheses and tentative conclusions from this study will be explored further when more data are collected in 1995.This paper, a product of the International Trade Division, International Economics Department, is part of a larger effort in the department to investigate the effects of international trade policy on individual producers. The study was funded by the Bank's Research Support Budget under the research project ""Rural Poverty and Agriculture in Mexico: An Analysis of Farm Decisions and Supply Responsiveness"" (RPO 67823).

eldis:A33340;Forest law and sustainable development: addressing contemporary challenges through legal reform;;"Thinking about forest management has undergone important changes over the last two decades. These changes have inspired attention to the reform of forest laws on a range of subjects, from forest planning and utilization to governance and trade. From its traditional narrow focus on government control and management of forests, modern forest law has expanded to encompass attention to environmental and social goals and to accommodating the interests of multiple stakeholders in forest management. At the same time, the enforcement dimension of forest law is a higher priority than ever, one that needs modernising to cope with the growing menace and sophistication of illegal logging.The purpose of this paper is to assist in the development and implementation of sound forest law. The study is intended to be a systematic and practical guide to the basic features of modern forestry legislation. It is designed to help not just lawyers but also foresters, economists, and other development professionals to identify legal issues that impinge on forests. It highlights a range of issues that should be considered in assessing the adequacy of forest laws and presents options for addressing those issues in ways that may improve the effectiveness of law as a foundation for sustainable forest management.
Key points include:

    the connection of forest laws with other areas of law have become more complex as they have grown in ambition and scope and as other types of laws increasingly impinge, directly or indirectly, on how forests are managed. Hence an appreciation of the role forest law plays within the wider legal system and how other areas of law are likely to affect its shape and operation is crucial
    Modern drafters must also refer to international law, where provisions on trade, environment, biodiversity, indigenous peoples, and climate change now influence the options that are available
    clear and secure forest tenure is increasingly seen as key to sustainable forest management. Yet property rights in forests are often complex and contested. There is a discrepancy between formal law customary law which often has a strong de facto role. Policymakers concerned with forest, land, and governance issues need to define a balance between state-centric forest laws and customary tenure regimes 
    planners of forestry laws are required to consider a wide range of ecological and social issues that might previously have been outside their purview
    It is important to create roles for multiple institutions with links beyond the forest sector to ensure better coordination on issues that overlap sectors, to promote greater public oversight and monitoring of forest decision-making, to institutionalise public participation, and to encourage greater private sector involvement
    Decentralization poses challenges in terms of defining what aspects of forest management can effectively be delegated to local governments and how supervision and fiscal authority should be allocated between central and decentralised forest administrations
    law enforcement to be effective, requires a combination of political will and strong financial and human institutional capacity

eldis:A17540;Are rural women disadvantaged in asset ownership and business relations in the Kyrgyz Republic?;;This paper examines how, over the past 10 years, Kyrgyzstan has privatised most of its agricultural land and distributed it to individual households. These households either farm alone or join together and farm cooperatively. This research seeks to examine whether women have been adversely affected in the process of privatisation, asset ownership, or business development. While the legal rules do not disadvantage women, historical customs and beliefs play a major role in rural areas.Using a key informant and focus group approach, the authors find that women want to and do participate in the market economy. The major impediment to women in asset ownership and business relations is the traditional understanding of gender roles within a family or small business enterprise when both men and women are involved. Many programs exist to assist women in receiving credit and operating small, independently owned enterprises.The authors concludes that while dramatic change is not required, women would benefit from additional training, specifically in non-traditional areas for women such as business management and agronomy. ;R.

eldis:A13786;Land rights and economic development: evidence from Vietnam;;This paper examines the impact of land reform in Vietnam which gives households the power to exchange, transfer, lease, inherit, and mortgage their land-use rights. The authors expect this change to increase the incentives as well as the ability to undertake long-term investments on the part of households. Their difference-in-differences estimation strategy takes advantage of the variation across provinces in the issuance of land-use certificates needed to enforce these rights.The results indicate that the additional land rights led to significant increases in the share of total area devoted to multi-year crops, as well as some increase in irrigation investment. These effects are stronger in areas that felt the impact of the land reform earlier.[Author] ;"Q. Do

eldis:A74310;Zero-deforestation commitments in Indonesia;;"Zero-deforestation commitments are emerging rapidly in Indonesia. They already encompass a large portion of crude palm oil production and almost all the pulp and paper (P&P) sector; typically, they reflect the values of the “no-deforestation, no-exploitation (social) and no-peat” policies.

These commitments depend on definitions of ‘forests’ for their identification and conservation, which in turn rely on methodologies such as High Conservation Value and High Carbon Stock.

Early implementation has revealed that the palm oil sector is facing a number of governance challenges to achieve commitments: the legal framework is not systematically supportive of the pledges, and the government promotes a different vision of sustainability. Of note is the fact that the P&P sector is more advanced.

Integration of smallholders into sustainable value chains poses another challenge for the palm oil sector: traceability, better environmental performance and improved yields require urgent action. Legalization of smallholder operations is critical and goes beyond commitments, because it determines access to financing and certification, among others.

To be effective, zero-deforestation commitments must align public and private governance arrangements. This requires an agreement on visions of sustainability supported by public policies; progress on land tenure; enforcement of progressive regulations at national and regional levels; and the implementation of strong policies to rationalize the expansion of small and medium holdings of oil palm.

Legacy issues must also be addressed for the main palm oil and P&P groups: land restitution through due processes, support to smallholders and investments in land restoration are some promising avenues worth pursuing.

eldis:A61737;Adaptation to climate change in agriculture, forestry and fisheries: perspective, framework and priorities;;"Climate change poses severe threats on agriculture. Even though some countries may experience beneficial change to agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), the majority, particularly developing countries, will experience significant negative impacts. This paper by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) promotes an integrative, holistic framework for climate change adaptation. It presents the potential impacts of climate change and the different approaches to adaptation, as well as knowledge gained through FAO's experience in the field. According to the report, there are two forms of climate change adaptation in agriculture: autonomous adaptation, in which individuals reactively adapt to changing conditions, and planned adaptation, which requires conscious policy options and response strategies aimed at altering the adaptive capacity of the agricultural system. The report states that a framework for climate change adaptation must simultaneously include:

    legal and institutional elements, such as legislation, human rights, tenure and ownership, and regulatory tools
    policy and planning elements, such as risk assessment and monitoring, strategy formulation, analysis and sectoral measures
    cropping, livestock, forestry, fisheries and integrated farming system elements covering crop and livestock production and methods, as well as water and land use management
    ecosystem elements, including biodiversity, resilience and species composition
    the linking of climate change adaptation processes and technologies to promote carbon sequestration and low carbon energy. 

The report elaborates on required adaptation measures by providing information on the work that FAO does in relation to climate change. Although these measures should be considered holistically, the paper breaks it down by subsector for ease of reference. Sections include land use and resource management (water, forestry, soil, livestock and fisheries), agrobiodiversity, food security, crop yield forecasts, rural livelihoods, capacity building and knowledge transfer. It suggests that due to FAO's diverse range of expertise, it is well placed to facilitate an integrated approach to climate change adaptation.

This sounds a remote possibility in the case of downstream country like Bangladesh, given its lower military capability vis-a-vis IndiaIndia has already taken several initiatives in violation of the Ganges Water Treaty and may violate the  Treaty in future, in the absence of any guaranteeChanging demographic, technological, economic and environmental factors underscore the need for an  cooperation beyond the three co-operation treaties that already exist in the region rather than conflict, not only at bilateral levels but more so at the regional levelManagement of shared river systems should grow beyond the sphere of national sovereignty and bilateral co-operation and must be addressed at the regional level to achieve the best possible use of available waterPolitical leaders in South Asian countries have to be convinced of the potential benefits accruing from such cooperation. The Indian hegemonic attitude towards other South Asian states needs to be redirected into a more cooperative one ;"F Noshab

eldis:A28601;Rural water tenure in East Africa: a comparative study of legal regimes and community responses to changing tenure patterns in Tanzania and Kenya;;"This paper looks at the water policy of Tanzania, and makes comparisons with the situation in Kenya. It focuses especially on recent attempts to move towards a participatory, demand-management approach to rural water supply. This focus on rural water availability is motivated by the fact that approximately 80% of the population of Africa is found in rural areas, and only about 37% of these people have access to 'safe' water sources.Policy Issues:The changes in the land tenure system and ownership patterns 'on the ground' should be monitored to assess the effects on water issues in both Kenya and Tanzania Clear guidelines on conflict prevention and resolution should be developed at the regional/national levelThe Water Rights allocation system should be reviewed at the same time as the existing Rights themselves are renewed and/or annulled. A participatory review process, involving a cross-section of water users (both those with Rights and without) and Ministry of Water staff from all levels, should be instituted Water sources should be ranked according to the threat of degradation, in terms of quantity and quality. It should prioritise monitoring and enforcement activities accordingly. This may be a good way of mobilising funding, through identifying particular problems and strategiesWater-management institutions should divide revenue into recipient end-users -and usesAny ""resource and catchment conservation charge"" should be carefully-judged to reflect the financial capacity of the paying community, and should be transparently directed towards effective conservation measuresAgainst a background of conflicting interests and widespread inefficiencies in the use of water, the importance of 'umbrella' community institutions, which represent a number of communities is clearThe activities of agencies working in the area of water supply should be co-ordinated at regular meetings hosted by the district or regional authoritiesIt is important in many areas that technical capacity to plan, maintain and repair water systems should be improved at the local level In cases where water systems are 'handed over' from NGOs or the Ministry of Water to local community institutions, a form of contract is necessary to ensure that the system infrastructure is clearly under the ownership of a specified institutionAs non-state stakeholders increase their abilities to manage water and to operate at a policy level, particularly umbrella organisations representing smallholders, they should be increasingly included in the government water allocation institutions ";C.

It begins with an overview of capacity building service providers and then assesses the leading providers currently operating. The report concludes by offering recommendations for policy makers, development partners and service providers. Recommendations relate to: raising awareness through media coverage, a lack of capacity building in the natural resource sector, inadequate support for REDD+ fund management, insufficient attention paid to calculating costs and benefits associated with REDD+ and delivery style and format of REDD+ training for communities. ;;;The Centre for People and Forests;eldis;01/01/2011;en;"capacity building;climate change;land use;research;environment";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"IDN;VNM;034;030;009";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A61982;http://www.recoftc.org/site/uploads/content/pdf/UNREDD%20RECOFTC%20Capacity%20Building%20Policy%20Brief_updated_250.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.recoftc.org%2Fsite%2Fuploads%2Fcontent%2Fpdf%2FUNREDD%2520RECOFTC%2520Capacity%2520Building%2520Policy%2520Brief_updated_250.pdf;;;;"Climate change poverty and vulnerability;author:The Centre for People and Forests (RECOFTC);Climate change Forestry;Climate change;Land use;REDD;CDKN;research;Environment;Climate change mitigation;Governance;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;Climate change agriculture and food security;tfmimport;Funder"
eldis:A11984;Land redistribution, tenure insecurity, and intensity of production: a study of farm households in southern Ethiopia;;This study analyses the determinants of land tenure insecurity and its impact on intensity of use of purchased farm inputs among households in southern Ethiopia. Seventeen percent of the households stated that they were tenure insecure. The feeling of tenure insecurity could be caused by the land redistribution policy in Ethiopia where household size has been the main criterion used for land allocation after the land reform in 1975. This would imply that land rich households should be more tenure insecure. Alternatively, the local power structure may be strong enough to counter this and cause the land rich, who are also likely to be influential, to be able to protect their land rights. The analysis reveals that, in the overall sample, relative farm size was not significantly correlated with tenure insecurity. When testing for each site, however, authors found that in four of the sites per capita farm size was positively associated with tenure insecurity, while in five other sites it had a significant negative association. This may be due to local historical, cultural, and demographic differences giving way to differences in the effects of the redistribution policy and the local power structure on tenure insecurity. The paper looks at the impact of tenure insecurity on the intensity of use of purchased farm inputs. The tenure insecurity variable was insignificant. Farmers in areas with a positive correlation between farm size and tenure insecurity were more likely to purchase farm inputs. Larger farms were more likely to use purchased inputs, but this effect was lower in areas with a positive correlation between farm size and tenure insecurity. Poverty and subsistence constraints may explain this absence of higher intensity of use of purchased inputs on small farms. By contrast, the land redistribution policy may have improved small farms’ access to purchased farm inputs [adapted from authors] ;"S. Holden

eldis:A61983;What is a REDD+ Pilot?;;This policy brief, published by the Centre for International Forestry Research, provides a snapshot of 17 REDD+ pilot projects in Indonesia. It begins by discussing early REDD+ pilots in Indonesia and then provides a comprehensive typology of REDD+ activities in Indonesia. The brief continues with a discussion of the motivation behind different pilot models and the following section outlines research needs and implications of REDD+ design in Indonesia. The brief concludes by arguing that the REDD+ pilot activities discussed illustrate challenges and a need to reform existing institutional, regulatory and land-tenure systems. It then asserts that Indonesia’s experience regarding the structure of sub-national activities and how these alternatives are shaped by institutional and governance conditions provide key lessons for the global community. ;E.

eldis:A28065;Access to land via Land Rental Markets;;Previous studies of land contracts have focused more on efficiency questions than on determinants of access to land and dynamics of access. By looking closely at the question of access to land, the authors conclude:land rental contracts more friendly to the poor than land sales markets to access land. Policy implication: promote land rental markets instead of land sales markets (other market failures remain) or land-market assisted land reform (too expensive)increasing capitalisation of agriculture and aging/absenteeism of landlords make entry into sharecropping more difficult for poor (assortative matching). Policy implication: Give potential tenants: i) Access to wealth-independent sources of credit (informal financial institutions), ii) Training in management (extension services for potential and current tenants). ;"A. de Janvry

eldis:A25954;Promoting food security in Rwanda through sustainable agricultural  productivity : meeting the challenges of population pressure, land  degradation, and poverty / Daniel C. Clay ... [et al.];;The objective of this technical paper is to shed insights on ways of reversing the spiraling decline of the land and the economy in rural Rwanda, with focus on the forces behind productivity decline in the Rwandan agricultural sector. The results are based on collaborative research between the Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture and Michigan State University.Among the key findings are that Rwandan farmers need to sustain and intensify their farming by pro-tecting the soil against erosion. They should also enhance soil fertility through the use of organic matter, chemical fertilizer, and lime.This report focuses on priority strategies and questions regarding the many issues that have come to the development debate about the highland tropics of Africa. It systematically applies details, nationwide survey data to these key questions. Moreover, the report points to the great value of excellent national agricultural statistics services and the national capacity to analyze data and provide insights for policy debate. ;Daniel C.

Looks at: the background to the land reform process in the 1990s the government's consistency in addressing the land question through an empirical evaluation of the outcome of its efforts to identify land to be acquired compulsorily in the 1990sevaluates the policy on the basis of the government's own set criteria used to list the 1 471 farms, that is: land under use (including derelict land), multiple farm ownership, farmer absenteeism, contiguity to communal areas, and oversized farms in terms of their agro-ecological potentialthe socio-economic implications of redistributing the land that was gazetted for acquisition by assessing its quality, use and economic role, the extent of multiple farm ownership, and the social features of the identified farmsConclusions include:the government has a tendency to rationalise land acquisition and redistribution on the basis of historical grievances and political demands and not on the basis of existing valid economic and technical reasons for land reformthe absence of a transparent plan and policy dialogue process meant rumour and subjective interest rather than facts have led land policy discourses, affecting the credibility of the land reform process the land reform programme must enhance economic expansion and diversification through expanding production outputs in a more efficient and rational structure of farm sizes the dominant fear that state-led land reform will bring economic collapse is unfounded, given the social and political implications of a failure to address the land question [adapted from author] ;S.

These issues include:while many pastoralists are suffering decline of their way of life through lack of representation and loss of resources, others have found ways of organising to lobby and co-operate with governments; creating laws, policies and services that promote pastoralist livelihoods without change, by 2015 access to education, health, clean water, economic progress and legal protection will have declined in pastoralist areaswithout change not only pastoralist people and their animals will suffer, but also the fragile environments in which they live will have degraded and the markets which they serve will declinethe decline of pastoralists’ conditions will affect national economies and societies in their entirety, increasing gaps between poor pastoralists and rich others, increasing frustration at erosion of rights and loss of land and increasing destitution will lead to conflict and migration countries with pastoralist populations will not be able to claim achievement of the Millennium Development Goals unless a new emphasis is placed on providing the services, markets, mobility and representation that the people need.Pastoralists at the Global Gathering called for further opportunities for pastoralists to meet one another at global and regional levels; and pastoralist leaders wish to continue sharing knowledge and developing collaboration among themselves and with governments and international agencies.

The study collected information on existing farming systems and estimated profitability for each land use. The profitability indicators used in the study are: net present value NPV , equivalent annuity and return to labour. Our estimation shows that in South Sulawesi the most profitable land-use system using the annual equity measure was clove gardens, followed by coconut-cacao mixed-gardens and coconut gardens. Timber-garden systems generated the highest return to labour of the other land uses, while the coconut used for sugar system generated the lowest USD 6 per day . In Southeast Sulawesi, the most profitable land-use system using the annual equity measure was timber-gardens teak , followed by pepper monoculture, and patchouli monoculture. Timber-gardens teak generated the highest return to labour of the others, while the cacao monoculture system generated the lowest USD 10 per day.

eldis:A22323;Independent forest monitoring in Honduras;;This report summarises the results of a monitoring and evaluation project of Independent Forest Monitoring (IFM) in Honduras. The project’s aim was to analyse institutional basis for an IFM system in Honduras, which could  be accomplished by developing working relationships with the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR), other governmental institutions, civil society and the private sector.The report draws several conclusions:there is interest by the forest authorities in implementing more effective control missionscorruption among forest authority personnel is due to a lack of incentives coupled with the high value of logged timbercooperation between the Independent Forest Monitoring (IFM) and the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR) has been ad hoc.  In order to develop more effective coordination of efforts, the establishment of more formal mechanisms such as a Memorandum of Understanding must be developedoperators who are committed to working within the law usually have difficulty knowing what is required. This is due to the arbitrary manner in which some aspects of forest legislation is interpreted.The report makes several recommendations to the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR), including the following:the administration must draw up a Memorandum of Understanding with the Monitor that clearly expresses the objectives and protocols of the projectHeads of Project Implementation Unites (UEPs), regional offices and the Department of Technical and Environmental Auditing of AFE-COHDEFOR (DATA) must be instructed to follow up field inspections carried out by the monitor in a more responsive and prompt mannerit is important to ensure that the Monitor, together with other relevant government agencies, can carry out its work without risk to its integrity, providing support personnel when necessary and not allowing any persons threatening the monitor to continue to do so with impunity.The report also makes some recommendations for government’s action:ensure that AFE-COHDEFOR (or any new forest institution if established) is provided with the financial, technical, logistical and human resources to guarantee that the institution can transparently and efficiently apply the lawprioritise the sustainable use of natural resources by local populations in forest policies. ;;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2006;en;"environment;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"HND;419";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A22323;http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/274/Second%20Summary%20Report.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Fmedia_library_get.php%2F274%2FSecond%2520Summary%2520Report.pdf;;;;"Labelling and Certification Forest Certification;Corporate Social Responsibility;Environment and Forestry;Environment;Labelling and certification;forest;Extractive industries;independent forest monitoring;timber"

	Measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) must move beyond a focus on measures of outcome to include measures of performance (procedural and distributional) in all phases of a REDD+ project, including social impacts. A future REDD+ mechanism must secure environmental and social safeguards, and assess the full range of social, environmental, political and economic impacts of REDD+.
	In outcome monitoring of the forests (e.g. carbon) local involvement should not be an option to “reduce” costs but rather to ensure greater voice and decision making power to those who will ultimately bear the greatest burden of forest conservation.

eldis:A28596;The land question and land reform in Southern Africa;;This paper discusses the nature of the land problem in the region and tries to situate the general land reform process in Zimbabwe within a regional context.It examines the four key land problems facing the region the discriminatory and insecure forms of land tenure that are found among variouslandownership regimes  the increasingly imbalanced landownership structures and factors underlying itthe contradictory tendencies towards irrational land-use patterns through both the over utilisation and underutilisation of land the devotion of most prime lands and resources to production for external markets rather than domestic agro-industrial needsThe paper assesses the effects of these emerging land problems on rural poverty and land conflicts, as well as how existing land management systems address these problems.Concludes that the major constraint to the evolution of effective land redistribution programmes in the 1990s was the emergence and dominance of a neo-liberal, monetarist macroeconomic trade and investment policy framework.  Anti-state intervention or free-market policy perspectives reinforced in Southern Africa the biases against nationalisation or compulsory acquisition of land and promoted the current focus on market-based approaches to land reform.  Under this system,  the prospects for rapid redistribution processes  are not self-evident unless substantial external resources to pay for the land are introduced in the land markets. ;S.

The report provides a balanced picture of deserts as ecosystems which form a special part of the world’s natural and cultural heritage, and not simply as land that is the end result of the process of desertification.The Global Deserts Outlook is the first thematic assessment report in the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) series of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It challenges readers to:consider the development potential of deserts and their conservation needsexplore what would be the most appropriate and sustainable livelihoods for people living in desert areas.Deserts do not have much water, but they do have other natural resources. The report argues that the knowledge and technology exist to manage these resources sustainably and that the challenge lies with determining and implementing appropriate actions for desirable long-term outcomes. ;;;United Nations [UN] Environment Programme ;eldis;01/01/2006;en;"environment;desertification";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A23587;http://www.unep.org/geo/gdoutlook/;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unep.org%2Fgeo%2Fgdoutlook%2F;;;;"sustainable livelihoods;deserts;desertification;Environment;natural resource management drylands;adaptation;Biodiversity and environment;desert;Environment and natural resource management"
eldis:A11462;Protest against the acquisition of common grazing land in Kadadara Panchayat, Gujarat;;Local governance has become increasingly significant as devolution from central and provincial levels is being attempted in India as a result of the enactment of the 73rd and 74th Amendment of the Constitution in 1993. The essence of local self governance is to enable a small community to maintain access and control over their natural and physical resources, to take collective decisions in the common public good and to provide resources in priority developmental actions. Another dimension of local self governance is to demand accountability from people in public positions. In the Indian context this responsibility has been given to local elected bodies called Gram Panchayats in the rural areas and municipalities in urban areas. This constitutional mandate has however, encountered stiff resistance from vested interests within and outside these institutions that seek to limit people's participation in this arena.The case highlights the spontaneous efforts of a group of Sarvodayais in protest against the decision of the local Panchayat in Kadadara, Gujarat to approve the lease order of the village common grazing ground without involving the rest of the village in that a decision. The case begins by describing the general setting of the incident, goes on to document the struggle of the people and analyses the outcomes in terms of state civil society dynamics.The author notes the role of two key players in the movement. The struggle was initiated through an article written in the local press, exposing the 'behind the scene' activities which led to the granting of the leasing rights. Throughoutout the struggle, the media provided consistent support by reporting the progress of the struggle, various events organised by it and linking it to the issue of rights of state vs people on the control of a common property resource like land. Second, the involvement of the Sarvodayis lended legitimacy to the movement.The author concludes by outlining the implications for civil society:the role played by social workers and other influential intermediaries bringing the people's voice into the public domain is vital. Such committed intermediaries play a crucial hand holding role for such micro level civil society assertionsthe case also highlights the limitation of such spontaneous, micro- level civil society assertions in achieving any long term changes. In this case the struggle helps to reverse the government's decision of giving  Kadadara's common grazing land to the industry. However it fails to influence the policy regarding people's ownership, control and decision making over their common property resources ;D. P.

eldis:A11346;Shifting sands: oil exploration in the Rift Valley and the Congo conflict;;"This paper addresses the impact of the oil exploration in the Rift Valley (East Congo) on the crisis in the country.  It demonstrates that major new conflict has broken out in the Congolese area concerned, endangering the whole peace process for the Democratic Republic of Congo and making a renewed cross-border conflict involving Uganda and Rwanda at least a possibility.The paper further demonstrates that more general problems known from oil exploration elsewhere in Africa are not only unresolved but might never be resolved. The sharing of costs and benefits of oil development is a key issue in all oil producing countries. In Uganda and the Congo, this is not even close to being addressed. In Uganda the ongoing inconclusive debate on the political future of the country makes it impossible to determine who in the future will be responsible for the minutiae of oil development or who in the long term is set to benefit. In the Democratic Republic of Congo it is not even settled who runs the area concerned, and even if it was, the determination of local interests and their expression in any form of political process would remain completely open.The paper recommends that economic reconstruction in the Great Lakes can only take place in a beneficial manner if it comes from the bottom up, deriving from local economic activities and interests. This does not preclude the exploitation of the region’s natural resources; it means that the local population should be enabled to take decisions about such exploitation and should enjoy its fruits. What is clear that if oil exploration is ever to proceed, there must be another way than armed conflict to include the expression of local interests. ";D.

eldis:A76291; Flooded cities;;"Does economic activity relocate away from areas that are at high risk of recurring shocks? We examine this question in the context of floods, which are among the costliest and most common natural disasters. Over the past thirty years, floods worldwide killed more than 500,000 people and displaced over 650,000,000 people. This paper analyzes the effect of large scale floods, which displaced at least 100,000 people each, in over 1,800 cities in 40 countries, from 2003 -2008. We conduct our analysis using spatial ly detailed inundation maps and night lights data spanning the globe's urban areas. We find that low elevation areas are about 3 -4 times more likely to be hit by large floods than other areas, and yet they concentrate more economic activity per square kilometre . When cities are hit by large floods, the low elevation areas also sustain more damage, but like the rest of the flooded cities they recover rapidly, and economic activity does not move to safer areas. Only in more recently populated urban areas, flo oded areas show a larger and more persistent decline in economic activity. Our findings have important policy implications for aid, development and urban planning in a world with rising urbanization and sea levels.

eldis:A69601;Home based entrepreneurs: research findings and recommendations;;"The Entrepreneurial sector in South Africa is seen as a critical component in addressing the fundamental issues of unemployment and poverty, as well as contributing to meaningful Black Economic Empowerment. This is very evident with the Home Based Entrepreneurs though low rates of entrepreneurship are still occurring. This research seeks to provide a deeper understanding of housing as a productive asset and its role in promoting economic activity and improved affordable housing supply, through supporting the activities of Home Based Entrepreneurs and Small Scale Landlords. The research focuses on obtaining a detailed understanding of how Small Scale Landlords and Home Based Entrepreneurs operate, the key constraints that they face and the extent to which they are using their home as a productive asset. This is set within the context of a broad understanding of entrepreneurship and current policy and practice in unleashing and supporting entrepreneurial activity. The report find that Housing in South Africa is an economically productive asset, offering opportunities for income generation and poverty alleviation both in terms of using the house as collateral for a loan as well as venue for business. It is estimated that up to 355,000 HBEs are active in Inner Cities and Townships generating a significant monthly income estimated at approximately R476 million per month. This comprises 13% of the total population of these areas. While most of these businesses can be classified as micro or small, for many of the entrepreneurs who own them, they represent their sole income.  To promote the emergence and growth of Home Based Entrepreneurs (HBE’s), the report recommends among other things, the following interventions by governments at the national, provincial and local levels:  Recognition and support of HBEs; Providing access to services, infrastructure and property rights; Providing information which promotes home based enterprises; Support to Municipalities; Providing information about service providers, which are able to assist entrepreneurs with skills, finance and other support; Review of regulatory requirements; Training their officials and politicians in the importance of supporting home based enterprise and on striking the balance between regulating harmful practices and unnecessarily obstructing harmless activities; Promoting linkages with the formal sector; Ensuring that commercial sites for small enterprises are available both within; existing residential areas and in planned residential areas.

eldis:A69600;Consolidate analysis of research into small scale landlords and home based entrepreneurs;;"Since the formation of the Government of National Unity in 1994, there have been significant strides  towards  the  transformation  of  the  lives  of  ordinary  South  Africans.  Set  within  a macroeconomic  policy,  which  is  focused  on  stimulating  economic  growth,  there  has  been significant delivery in respect of the provision of housing, engineering services such as water and electricity and social services such as education, health and social safety nets for the most vulnerable.  A  significant  portion  of  Government  annual  expenditure  continues  to  be  directed to meeting these needs.Yet despite these efforts by Government, poverty, unemployment and poor service delivery has increased. The South Africa, Human Development Report (2003) indicates that 48,5%  of  the  South  African  population (21,9million people) fall below  the  national  poverty  line.  In addition  poverty  has  a  highly skewed  gender,  race  and  spatial  profile  with  the  majority  of  the  poor  being  female,  African and living in rural areas.This  research  seeks  to  contribute  to  addressing  these  fundamental  issues  by  obtaining  a deeper  understanding  of  housing  as  a  productive  asset  and  its  role  in  promoting economic  activity  and  improved  affordable  housing  supply,  through  supporting  the activities of Home Based Entrepreneurs and Small Scale Landlords. It  is estimated  that  currently  these  Housing Entrepreneurs  are  generating  significant income  as  a  result  of  their  activities  estimated  to  be  R900  million  per  month.  Many of these Housing Entrepreneurs fall within the low income categories.The  research  found  further  that  significant  opportunities  exist,  both  in  terms  of  existing Housing  Entrepreneurs  growing  their  businesses,  as  well  as  encouraging  the  emergence  of new Housing Entrepreneurs. Given  the  challenges  faced  by  South  Africa  of  high  levels  of  unemployment  and  poverty, Government needs to recognise that housing is an economically productive asset that can be used  to  create  income.  This  can  occur  in  a  manner  that  is  not  detrimental  to  the environment  or  residential  areas.  Government  policy  needs  to  shift  to  recognise  this  and initiatives  and  programmes  should  be  implemented  by  both  Government  and  the  private sector to support the growth and development of Housing Entrepreneurs.

eldis:A11507;Botswana National Land Policy;;This Bostwana government report  examines the linkages between land rights and both rural and urban poverty in Botswana, which constitute a strong element of the Bostwana PRSP. Its basis for this arises out of a  need to adjust the land policy and land laws, administration and management to the changes being brought about by economic development and associated urbanisation in Botswana. It considers a series of measures to tackle urban landlessness and the anti-social conduct of land hoarding and land speculation, proposes the following policy recommendations over a broad spectrum of issues, some of which include:  land rights of the poor - strengthen  planning and implementation capacity of land boards and councils to ensure that poor people have access to land.land rights for women - educate women and raise their awareness of their rights in terms  of existing opportunities and can make informed choices.land rights of minority groups - Upholding the rights of minorities to pursue a different life style and maintain a distinct culture from that of the majority  HIV/AIDS and land rights - which includes conducting a special investigation of the impact of HIV/AIDS on land rights, land use and occupation in urban and rural areas.Other areas that this document addresses includes land markets, and land taxation issues as well as urban and peri-urban land management issues. ;;;Oxfam;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"land;land tenure;land rights;land access;poverty";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"BWA;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A11507;http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/livelihoods/landrights/downloads/botissue.rtf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfam.org.uk%2Fwhat_we_do%2Fissues%2Flivelihoods%2Flandrights%2Fdownloads%2Fbotissue.rtf;;;;"SADC;rural land mangement;urbanisation;Poverty;EADI;Governance;land tenure;Agriculture and food;urbanpoverty;land entitlements;Land tenure;land access;land rights;PRSP;urban land management;peri-urban land"
eldis:A65383;Agricultural water storage in an era of climate change: assessing need and effectiveness in Africa;;The Sri Lankan based International Water Management Institute (IWMI) has produced this report assessing the need and effectiveness of agricultural water storage (AWS) in Africa, in the context of climate change risks. Widely anticipated to make a key contribution to climate change adaptation through the mitigation of climate variability, AWS will have to significantly improve if it is to achieve intended benefits. The authors begin by describing different AWS options available, covering reservoirs, ponds and tanks, aquifers, soil moisture, and natural wetlands, and outlining the potential impacts of climate change for each. By modifying both the availability and demand of water, climate change makes all AWS options potentially vulnerable in terms of performance, cost, and adverse effects. Also described is the development of a diagnostic tool based on biophysical and demographic indicators, designed to provide fast, ‘first-cut’ evaluations on the need for and effectiveness of different AWS options. This diagnostic tool was applied to sub-Saharan Africa and, in more detail, to the Volta Basin and the Ethiopian portion of the Blue Nile Basin. The findings concluded that the greatest need for AWS was in the Sahelian zone, the Horn of Africa, and southern Africa, with localised hotspots in Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Malawi, and Mozambique. Population density was the primary indicator of need in Ethiopia and Ghana, rather than areas with the least rainfall as might have been anticipated. The study concludes that ,under a ‘middle impact’ climate change scenario, the effectiveness of AWS will decrease in both the Volta Basin and the Blue Nile Basin. The authors note that this approach requires refinement through further research and more testing in real planning situations. Nevertheless, it can provide a first-step toward a more rigorous approach to future AWS planning. ;"M. McCartney

eldis:A69605;Small scale landlords: research findings and recommendations;;"Small Scale Landlords make a significant contribution to the South African economy.  They provide  a  range  of accommodation  types  for  approximately  15%  of  all  South  African  households  (1,85 million  households).  60%  of  this  stock  (1,1  million  households)  comprises  Household Rental  including  both  formal  and  informal  units  located  in  backyards.  This research  shows  that these small scale  Landlords  are  making a  significant  contribution  to  the  South African  economy  firstly through  the  provision  of  a  range  of  accommodation  types  that  is  generally  well  located and  affordable  to  very  poor  households  and  secondly  through  contributing  to  income generation and wealth creation, at a level that is estimated to be R421 million per month.
In addition, the research found that there is potential for growth within the Small Scale Landlord sector. However this potential is currently not being realised. Given the challenges faced  by  South  Africa  with  a  significant  housing  shortage,  high  levels  of  poverty  and unemployment  and  a  strong  focus  on  enterprise  development,  it  is  evident  that  there  is  a  need for and value in supporting the growth of the Small Scale Landlord sector.In this regard a range of recommendations are made focusing on policy implications, financial products,  information  products  and  tools  and  state  owned  stock.  The  authors propose  that the recommendations, to be developed by  the National Department of Housing, should  be  implemented  by  Private  and  Public  Sector stakeholders who must work together within the terms of a National Policy Framework. Furthermore, the role  of  Government should be  that  of  leader  and  enabler,  creating  the  legislative  and  regulatory framework  that  supports  Small  Scale  Landlords  and  use  incentives  to  encourage  them  to improve  the  quality  of  their  stock  and  build  additional  stock.  Financial  Institutions  are also required to provide loans linked to business support thereby increasing Small Scale Landlords access  to  capital  while  business  support  service  providers  should  encourage  and  support  Small Scale Landlords. Overall  these  interventions  should  encourage  and  support  Small Scale Landlords to formalise and operate more effectively and support the expansion of the Small Scale Landlord Sector. ";"R.

eldis:A73712;Who owns the world's land? A global baseline of formally recognized indigenous and community land rights;;"In recent years, there has been growing attention and effort towards securing the formal, legal recognition of land rights for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Communities and Indigenous Peoples are estimated to hold as much as 65 percent of the world’s land area under customary systems, yet many governments formally recognize their rights to only a fraction of those lands. This gap—between what is held by communities and what is recognized by governments—is a major driver of conflict, disrupted investments, environmental degradation, climate change, and cultural extinction. This report seeks to contribute to this field as the first analysis to quantify the amount of land formally recognized by national governments as owned or controlled by Indigenous Peoples and local communities around the world.

eldis:A65386;Mesoamerican coffee: building a climate change adaptation strategy;;"In Mesoamerica, coffee is an important part of agricultural GDP and export revenues which supports about half a million farmers, and employs millions of people on the farms and all along the supply chain. This policy brief summarises the potential risks and impacts of climate change on coffee farming in the region. Traditional coffee agroforests provide important ecosystem services and conserve significant carbon stocks. Climate change threatens coffee production, as projected increases in temperature and changes in rainfall will likely reduce crop suitability in most current growing areas. Options include adaptation (e.g., agronomic interventions), alternative income sources (e.g., crop substitution), and migration (e.g., to more suitable higher altitudes). Supply chain actors must collaborate and make strategic, collective investments to respond to these new threats. Given the long lead time for investments, actions must be taken now. Given the importance of coffee to Mesoamerican economies, adaptation to climate change should be made a priority. In particular, states should invest in and utilise research to create site-specific adaptation policies, which may involve: 

    developing climate stress-resistant coffee varieties; validating agronomic management strategies; and improving market links
    providing financial assistance via subsidies, insurance, and ecosystem payments (through either direct remuneration, or the development of markets to reward sustainable land practices and forest conservation)
    promoting diversification as a short-term risk management strategy and a long-term bridge to full crop substitution.

eldis:A40827;Land tenure and violent conflict in Kenya;;"The violence which followed the contested December 2007 Kenyan election was, arguably, an opportunity for historical grievances to be settled. This paper focuses on the land issue in regards to Kenya, asserting that land is a primary cause of conflcit in the country as it has been the crux of economic, cultural and socio-economic change. In fact as the author highlights, the land issue is not confined to Kenya but due to the importance of land for livelihoods and identity in Africa – with its multiple emotional, spiritual and ethnic dimensions – governance of land is at the heart of the state-society relationship in the continent. Principally regarding the Kenyan context - and in lieu of the government’s new draft land policy - the authors highlight key factors driving land dispute: 

    many post-colonial agrarian countries inherited extremely skewed patterns of land distribution. Few agrarian states have been able to successfully alter these patterns of land accumulation by an elite, and scarcity amongst the poor
    the difficult nature of the interaction between customary and state-run systems, which gives rise to the question ‘who owns the land’. This is of massive political importance – 75% of conflicts over the past 25 years have taken place in agrarian states
    fundamental structural factors include “rapid population growth, environmental degradation, and slow rates of economic development”, all of which put more pressure on rural and periurban farmers and livestock-keepers to produce more food on a declining resource-base 

The paper offers a number of findings/recommendations, including - 

    ‘immigrant’ communities’ feel a lack of secure tenure, and are then discouraged investing in environmentally sustainable practices. This feeds into stereotypes that they are merely ‘milking the land’. Expectation of attack and displacement may also prevent ‘immigrant’ communities from strengthening relationships with neighbouring ‘local’ communities. These weak intercommunal relationships contribute to tensions and more violence is therefore likely
    tenure security (under both customary and statutory systems) has been greatly undermined, through arbitrary decision-making, corruption, backtracking on the part of government, and lack of redress for those who have lost land through violence. More appropriate law is needed – lawmakers must pay attention to perceptions at the local level and study obstacles to implementation of policies and laws
    profound changes are required in the relationships between the state and local communities, as well as between different communities, as regards land governance. The governance of land must be institutionalized and rooted at the local level through innovative structures of community participation.

eldis:A44098;Good practices in participatory mapping: a review prepared for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD);;"Participatory mapping, commonly used in participatory development, plays an important role in helping marginalised groups by making visible the association between land and local communities, highlighting important social, historical and cultural knowledge as well as presenting geographical feature information. 
This review is intended to provide a broad background in the use of participatory mapping processes and the range of tools available to practitioners. It is not exhaustive but aims to give readers a greater appreciaion of how participatory mapping has involved from a relatively simplistic participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tool into a community of practice spanning a range of sophisticated technologies and processes. 
It draws on a number of examples from around the world, with special attention given to projects supported by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), as this organisation commissioned the review. However, it contains useful insights, lessons and pitfalls in both the processes and tools available for participatory mapping. 
This review provides: 

    An outline of what is involved in participatory mapping and participatory mapping applications
    A review of the effectiveness of range of participatory mapping tools such as hands-on mapping, using scale maps and images, 3-D models and geographic information systems (GIS)
    A look at best practices and processes with awareness of enabling/disabling environments, the role of development intermediaries, awareness of mapping impacts and the importance of processes
    A matrix of participatory mapping tools outlining strenghs, weaknesses and resources needed

eldis:A12505;Summary of the main points contained in the conclusions and recommendations of the final report of the extractive industries review;;This document summarises the main points in the conclusions and recommendations sections of the World Bank’s Final Report of the Extractive Industries Review (EIR). The document focuses particularly on a few of the issues touched upon in the report, such as indigenous peoples’ rights, human rights generally, World Bank accountability/institutional issues, and the definition of poverty and sustainable development.The Final Report recognises that if the World Bank Group is to comply with its mandate, strict conditions must be applied to Extractive Industry (EI) projects. It also recognises that at present risks and benefits are unevenly shared and that the majority of the negative burden falls on the poor, local communities, women and indigenous peoples. Unfortunately, the end result still appears to be a ‘net gain’ analysis that is incompatible with the ‘do no harm’ approach that is supposed to underlie World Bank safeguard policies.EIR Final Report key points and recommendations include:poverty is defined from a human rights perspectivesustainable development is seen as centred on human beings, communities and societies rather than on purely economic groundsfor indigenous peoples poverty alleviation and sustainable development may have additional or nuanced interpretations/requirements and include effective guarantees for territorial rights and the right to self-determinationthere is a strong focus on the need to improve governance issues in EI projects, with governance interpreted broadly to include issues such as rule of law, adequate legal frameworks recognising and protecting indigenous peoples’ rights, human rights generally, revenue sharing, etc.the World Bank Group should not increase its involvement in EI projects without addressing a series of prior conditions, which relate both to borrower and corporate governance and institutional reforms within the World Bank Groupindigenous peoples and other affected parties do have the right to participate in decision-making and to give their free prior and informed consent throughout each phase of a project cycle[adapted from author] ;F.

eldis:A11661;Oil for nothing: multinational corporations, environmental destruction, death and impunity in the Niger Delta;;"This paper reports the findings of a US delegation to the Niger Delta to investigate the environmental and human rights record of oil corporations.Evidence shows that the oil companies operating in Nigeria
have not only disregarded their responsibility towards the
environment but have acted in complicity with the military’s
repression of Nigerian citizens. The profit-driven collusion between multinational oil companies and the past and present Nigerian governments has cost many lives and continues to threaten the stability of the region.The key findings of the delegation include:oil corporations in the Niger Delta seriously threaten the livelihood of neighboring local communities. Large scale environmental pollution is evident in the region, fishing and farming have become impossible or extremely difficult in oil-affected areas, and even drinking water has become scarcethe presence of multinational oil companies has had additional adverse effects on the local economy and society, including loss of property, price inflation, prostitution, and irresponsible fathering by expatriate oil workersorganised protest and activism by affected communities regularly meet with military repression, sometimes ending in the loss of life. In some cases military forces have been summoned and assisted by oil companiesreporting on the situation is extremely difficult, due to the existence of physical and legal constraints to free passage and free circulation of information. Similar constraints discourage grassroots activismEnvironmental and social justice for the people of the Niger Delta remain central issues for achieving peace in the region. As long as people’s calls for justice continue to be ignored and resisted by both multinational oil corporations and the Nigerian government, the situation in the Delta can only deteriorate.The authors conclude that the survival of a large number of Niger Delta communities is now dependent on their ability to establish
their entitlement to local resources.

eldis:A11910;Smallholder income and land distribution in Africa: implications for poverty reduction strategies;;"It has been argued that many of the poverty reduction strategy papers pay insufficient attetion to the role of land access and land distribution in rural poverty.   Redressing the inequalities between small-scale and large-scale farming sectots  is likely to be an important element of an effective rural poverty reduction strategy in countries such as Zimbabwe and Kenya.   However, within Africa’s small-scale farming sectors, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to quantifying land distribution patterns and considering how they will affect feasible pathways out of poverty.|This paper provides a micro-level foundation for discussions of land allocation and its relation to poverty within the smallholder sectors of Eastern and Southern Africa. Results are drawn from nation-wide houshold surveys between 1990 and 2000 in five countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Zambia.| The paper addresses four major points:
why geographically-based targeted approaches to poverty reduction  - e.g. focusing on marginal areas -  is likely to miss a significant share of the poor in any particular country regardless of targeting efficiency in these areas:  poverty among smallholder households is not primarily a geographic phenomenon. Most of the variations in smallholder incomes tend to be within-village rather than between village, or in other words, the poor are geographically scattered throughout all regions of a country. This has implications for targeting vulnerable groups. Targeting of vulnerable, resource poor  households requires greater emphasis on intra-community targeting, as a complement to regional targeting. This makes targeting more challenging and costly to avoid private trading disincentives, if the development of private sector-led input and food marketing systems is considered to be an objective of government policy. On the positive side, the fact that poor as well as relatively better-off smallholder farmers are located in the same areas is good news for generating multiplier effects from agricultural growth.
 Why current enthusiasm for community-driven development approaches will require serious attention to how resources are allocated at local levels:  in all five countries there are serious disparities in incomes and land allocation at the local level. This may give pause to current development initiatives focusing on “community-driven development.” While it is possible that village-level disparities in incomes and land could naturally occur as an outgrowth of differences in capabilities and entrepreneurship across households, it is at the very least important to ask whether local or national governance decisions over time play a role in generating such disparities. The data presented here is unable to provide a clear answer to this question. However, the findings do emphasize the need for promoting greater transparency and equity in village-level resource allocation decisions if there is to be a serious attempt to combat rural poverty. This conclusion flows from the strong association between landholding size and per capita incomes, especially at low levels of landholding size. Over time, it is possible that broadbased economic growth coupled with education can help pull landless and near-landless households into more remunerative non-farm activities, lessening the importance of access to land as a dominant determinant of income levels.
 Why meaningful poverty alleviation strategies in many countries will require fundamental changes to make land more accessible to smallholder farmers:  this paper highlights a major structural problem within smallholder agriculture in these African countries. Without major changes in access to land the following processes in these countries are likely to continue:farm sizes are likely to decline over time landlessness and near-landlessness will emerge as increasingly important social and economic problems unless growth in the non-farm sectors can be substantially increasedgiven existing agricultural technology and realistic projections of future productivity growth potential, large segments of the rural population will be unable to climb out of poverty through agricultural growth on their own farms.These findings reinforce the idea that where access to land is highly  concentrated and where a sizable part of the rural population lack sufficient land to earn a livelihood, then special measures will be necessary to tackle the problem of persistent poverty. Recent empirical results indicate a negative relationship between the concentration of rural assets and the poverty-reducing effects of economic growth. Structural transformation processes may be retarded in situations in which the distribution of rural assets are so highly skewed that a large strata of the rural population may be unable to benefit from agricultural growth incentives that would otherwise generate broad-based growth multipliers. In some African countries, the distribution of land and other productive assets appears to be more skewed than available estimates for Asia at the time of the green revolution as well as most of South America. Education, which played a role in much of Asia by allowing households to exit agriculture into more lucrative off-farm jobs, is relatively low in most areas of rural Africa by world standards. Improving access to key assets, such as land and education, appears to be necessary to translate agricultural growth incentives into broad based structural transformation.
Why sustained income growth for the poorest strata of the rural population will depend on agricultural growth in most countries, and why agricultural productivity growth, while most easily generating gains for better-off smallholder farmers, is likely to offer the best potential for pulling the poorest and land-constrained households out of poverty:  Sustained  income growth for the poorest segment of the rural population is likely to depend on agricultural growth in most countries. The literature on growth linkages indicates that the first-round beneficiaries of agricultural growth generate important multiplier effects by increasing their expenditures on a range of local off-farm and non-farm activities that create second-round benefits for a wide-range of other households in the rural economy. Income growth derived from agricultural productivity growth generates demand for non-farm activities that has absorbed the rural poor into more viable non-farm activities. In much of Africa, the consumption growth linkages have been found to be especially important  The extent and magnitude of these second round effects depend on a number of factors, including education, infrastructure, and institutional development, but importantly include whether the income stimulus is widely spread . The initial distribution of land and other productive assets, which clearly influences how broad-based the first round beneficiaries of agricultural growth will be. While sizeable segments of the smallholder populations do not have enough land assets to respond to “smallholder commercial agriculture” opportunities, the data suggest that there are smallholders with relatively more land and related assets, who probably can respond, and who are located in many of same villages as those who have relatively little land on a household per capita basis.  This finding holds powerful implications for policy if shown to be widespread, as suggested by the data. Dynamic labor and services markets, and other employment opportunities should be easier to create (other factors constant) in the very locations where some smallholders are investing and raising their output and productivity. Pro-active public sector investment and policy support in developing these labor and service markets will be a key determinant of the magnitude of the growth linkages to be derived from agricultural growth.

eldis:A32292;Landlessness within the vicious cycle of poverty in Ugandan rural farm households: why and how it is born?;;"Rising poverty in rural Uganda is linked to increasing landlessness, as the latter drives land degradation and reduces agricultural productivity. This paper examines the complex relationship between owning land and poverty.  It identifies effective strategies and land policy guidance to address this concern.   Findings from a comparison of recent panel data indicate that:•	landless households are headed by younger males with lower levels of education, and are smaller than     the landed households•	higher per capita income is positively associated with land holdings•	poverty reduction reduces the risk of becoming landless•	inheriting land and resources capital reduces a household’s probability of becoming landless.To prevent further landlessness among rural Ugandan families, the authors suggest: •	providing development pathways, such as enhancing livestock and the human capital of households •	provide proportionate resource transmission by parents to children, for example ensure that parents with one acre will pass on an acre to their children.

eldis:A59830;The new competition for land: Food, energy, and climate change;;"This paper discusses the competition for land resources and the issue of land-use change due to the rising demand for food and energy, specifically for the transport sector. The linkages between land, food, and energy become particularly complex within the context of climate change. This is not only because agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, but also because climate change itself can alter the productivity and availability of land. 
The paper reviews the key factors leading to increased competition for land as a resource - primarily the demand for liquid fuel, and the decline in available global oil reserves. Additionally, it is asserted that political factors and related market forces can add to the demand for land. The authors examine the biofuel innovation pathways in the USA, Brazil, and Europe, and suggest that political, social, and technological factors have a major influence on the competition for land. It is concluded that there is a need for an integrated approach to the food-energy-environment nexus, and that strong political support is required to boost innovation and sustainability to enable sustainable intensification of agriculture, rather than the expansion of area under cultivation.

eldis:A32291;Promoting sustainable land management through trade: examining the linkages between trade, livelihoods and sustainable land management in degraded areas;;"Drylands have potential for economic activity now markets are emerging for natural products such as aloe or gum Arabic. However it is difficult to take advantage of these opportunities because there is a lack of structure for this market. A regulatory framework providing an enabling environment for increasing investment in the sustainable use and management of land and natural resources would be beneficial. 
Interactions are required among trade and environment stakeholders which might be facilitated through the trade strategies of the various multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). Incentive mechanisms have to be created through adequate policies and interventions at the international, regional and national levels. 
Conclusions and recommendations of the report include: 

    when stringent enforcement mechanisms are not in place in MEAs, incentives can be created with a regulatory regime to meet sustainable development objectives 
    international trade regimes and related government policies can directly or indirectly affect the resilience of dryland ecosystems, by increasing agricultural production for exports
    diversification of production has proved to be a promising way of enabling new opportunities for sustainable production to emerge 
    persistent distortions need to be reformed and new market access opportunities in the international trade regime opened for generating further investment for sustainable land management
    existing opportunities within the international trade regime could be enhanced under the ongoing Doha negotiations in the areas of special products, sensitive products, the liberalisation of EGS (Environmental Goods and Services), and assistance in developing country capacity
    WTO members must give priority to achieving progress in these negotiations and the sustainable development implications need to be highlighted
    it is also crucial that global-level discussions be brought to the country-level, translating international level policies and dialogue into country-based interventions
    it is fundamental that sustainable land management is no longer seen as a technical concern of environmentalists, but rather as a means to contribute to sustainable development and poverty reduction
    multi-stakeholder processes for dialogue, information exchange and mutual learning are required to build synergies and better understand gaps in capacity, needs and resource availability

eldis:A75473;Benefits (and losses) from rent control in the Philippines: An empirical study of Metro Manila ;;"This study examines benefits of rent control law in Metro Manila. The results show that rent control benefits are conditional to occupying a rent-controlled unit and on tenure. The benefits of rent control are found positive. Many poor and low-income households are benefited but the distributional effects are minimal since non-poor families have equal access to rent-controlled units. Evidence of losses or income transfers from landlords to tenants is not substantiated. The most probable income transfers are those from short-stayers to long-stayers. Rent control is a poor mechanism for income transfer. However, the rental housing market tend to be monopolistic and rent control maybe necessary to prevent economic eviction and abuses on payment of key monies. In this case, government has to provide better monitoring mechanism and ensure enforcement of lease contracts.

eldis:A75472;A plan for the development and supply of agricultural water ;;"The agricultural policies after Independence in South Korea can be roughly classified into three policies: policies for food increase till the 1970s, policies for structural improvement in the 1980s and 1990s, and policies for rice production adjustment in the 2000s. In the process, a policy for price support to encourage food production and increase farmer income, the policies for modernization of production processes, and the policies for expanding the scale of management were made and implemented. In recent years, the policies for direct payment and a policy for eco-friendly farming were introduced to cope with the waves of free international trade of agricultural products and global competition.

eldis:A31142;Urban and peri-urban aquaculture development in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India;;"This paper follows the 2005 Dhaka workshop on ""Peri-urban aquatic production and improvement of the livelihoods of the urban poor in south east Asia"". It aims to raise awareness and create dialogue amongst policy-makers and development practitioners concerning the nature, extent and potential of urban and peri-urban aquaculture in Bangladesh and West Bengal, in support of the Bengal Platform established at the workshop. The Bengal Platform works for information exchange and mutual support in the field of peri-urban aquatic production in south east Asia.The paper argues that urban and peri-urban aquaculture is locally important for income, livelihoods and food security and can contribute to enhanced wastewater management and environmental protection. The authors call for more information on the nature and extent of urban and peri-urban aquaculture to specify the importance of such production at district, state and national levels, and consequently its value in competing for scarce development resources.The authors argue that the establishment of the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Committee, constitutes a potentially important element of a planning framework for urban and peri-urban aquaculture development, where the needs and expectations of primary stakeholders in the wetlands can be incorporated in planning and decision-making. The committee has representatives from municipal authorities, government departments, producer associations and community-based organisations (CBOs) representing groups of people living and working in the wetlands. However, by adopting the Peri-Urban Participatory Action Planning and Implementation (PU-PAPi) approach in future development planning it is anticipated that the needs of the vulnerable people not directly represented on the committee will be clarified and addressed.

eldis:A30269;Linkages between rural population ageing, intergenerational transfers of land and agricultural production: are they important?;;The paper considers:  the question of whether the process of population ageing affects the ways in which land is passed on between members of different generationsthe likely implications of ageing-related changes in intergenerational transfers  for food production in developing countriesThe paper concentrates primarily on rural population ageing in contexts where the individual ownership of land or natural resources is a predominant socio-economic  phenomenon, although it also considers communal ownership situations.The authors conclude that: the need to conceptualize the elderly as a necessary element in exchange networks is commonly overlooked and omitted from policy considerations, yet this holds the most promise for developing creative new strategies to assure food security and social stabilitythe apparent intensity and durability of intergenerational exchange relationships suggest that national governments need to foster them, rather than ignore or erode them, and to support civil society institutions which do the sameinsights derived from the experience of population ageing in various rural settings can suggest the kind of policy interventions that will   help to bring about a socially desired path of rural development in the future if the importance of population ageing for intergenerational transfers of land is confirmed, then establishing constructive, collaborative policies towards the elderly could be crucial for the outcomes of such transfers to be favourable  to the agricultural sector. ;"D.

eldis:A11489;The case of Kok Hin Khao land rights conflicts in Nam Phong district of Khon Kaen - Thailand;;This paper is a report on anthropological fieldwork on the civil society movements in northeastern Thailand. The case of Kok Hin Khao land rights conflicts in the district of Nam Phong of Khon Kaen province was thoroughly examined to understand the current dynamics of civil society in the Northeast.It is argued that the discrepancy between the government's development rhetoric and what actually happened at the grassroots level has laid the ground for the emergence of contemporary civil society to protect its own interests. While the Thai state is responsible for initiating the concept of development, village discourses about the concept cannot be interpreted as reflecting unquestioned hegemony of a ruling elite. Development, thus, has become a political-cultural location that entails not only cooperation of villagers with state agencies, but also contestation of the authority of some of these agencies. The contestation over development meanings and practices is conducive to the establishment of grassroots civil society.The author concludes by reflecting on the impact of development and modernity, as many villagers today find themselves in competition with the commercial sector and some government agencies for local natural resources. Conflicts over the use and control of local natural resources, between local communities, various government agencies, and urban industries are rising. Local natural resources, which once were supervised by local communities as local common property, were gradually transferred to be under the tight control of the Thai state and urban capitalists in the names of development, progress, and law. The tensions which surfaced as a result of conflicting development interests have contributed to the rise of grassroots civil society. Village cultural constructions of development and the rise of civil society have emerged to provide a critique of state development strategies and to propose development alternatives that would enable many villagers to gain a better share of the fruit of development. ;R.T.

eldis:A33086;Anglo American: the alternative report;;"This report documents the performance of the world’s second largest mining company with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Despite Anglo American’s participation in various voluntary CSR initiatives, it continues to abuse human rights, fuel conflict and damage the local environment and livelihoods. The report documents a number of Anglo American’s activities which highlight that there is still a long way to go as far as the company's commitment to CSR, including: 

    trade unionists who have protested against AngloGold Ashanti mining operations in Colombia have been murdered by military units assigned to protect the company 
    AngloGold Ashanti has links with armed groups responsible for human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo 
    in the Philippines and South Africa, local communities threatened with Anglo American mines have faced severe repression in their fight to stay on their land 
    in Ghana, mining operations have devastated the environment and polluted vital water resources 

The UK government’s opposition to a binding framework for corporate accountability enables companies such as Anglo American to continue to acquire vast wealth at the expense of the security and human rights of the communities in which it operates. The report insists that the UK government must state its support for international, legally binding regulation so that companies like Anglo American can be made accountable for their actions around the world.

eldis:A14538;Só para o Inglese ver: the policy and practice of tenure reform in Mozambique;;This paper examines the fundamentals of Mozambican land policy from a livelihoods perspective and identifies considerable potential for improving the sustainability of rural livelihoods and the flexibility and cost effectiveness of policy instruments aimed at increasing security of tenure.The paper examines the impact of the cancellation of private land applications in one province, and argues that, notwithstanding the apparent official reluctance to implement this element of the policy, the impact has been almost wholly beneficial for local community groups.Challenges to land policy framework to realise pro poor policy objectives include:the uneven implementation of the lawabsence of official resources for community land delimitationsthe cursory manner in which local consultations are conducted.Recommendations include:investment in and engagement with the new community institutionsfurther mechanisms need to be developed that will translate the newly registered natural capital into realisable benefits for the rural pooran approach that assists the rural poor in understanding the value and potential of their land is criticalthe existing land administration system, geared more to servicing the needs of the minority, has to be turned into a service for the rural majorityconsultations should be viewed as serious opportunities rather than bureaucratic hurdles, delimitations should be treated as the beginning of longer term development processes rather than isolated exercises in boundary establishment, and the new institutions created as a result of the land policy should be allowed and encouraged by the state to be formal community representatives rather than being marginalisedthe more the practise of tenure reform begins to conform to the policy intentions, the quicker and more effectively will those in rural areas be given the opportunity to improve their livelihoods.[adapted from author] ;"S.

eldis:A30267;Who owns the world's forests?;;This study examines land tenure data for 24 of the 30 most forested countries accounting for 93% of the worlds natural forest cover and examines global trends in forest ownership. The report also reviews the emerging evidence of the possibilities created by community forest ownership and management and concludes with a description of the data’s key implications and opportunities for key actors to address forest tenure issues.Data analysis focuses on the type and distribution of ownership of forest land and, given the high prevalence of ‘public’ ownership (at least as it is recorded in government data), the report also examines public forest concessions in 16 of the selected countries. To determine trends in forest ownership the report examines devolutionary or other legal reforms which recognise or strengthen community forest tenure or property rights. Case studies of differing approaches to managing the transition towards more community based management are presented from Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Bolivia and the Russian far east.Finally opportunities to improve forest management and conservation which this transitory phase presents are discussed. Among the needs identified are:Better knowledge on actual forest tenure claims, disputes and ownership Greater awareness of transition strategies, lessons and best practiceMajor investments to facilitate this transitionClarification and identification of property rights to ecosystem servicesMarkets and global finance must be creatively leveraged to support tenure reformsThe report also outlines roles for the various stakeholders including:Forest-dependent peoples Socially responsible forest industries Forest management certifying bodiesMultilateral development banks Investors  Environmental NGOs Governments [The origional publisher no longer provides this document.

eldis:A70206;Land rights for Pakistani (Muslim) women: law and policy;;"The Law and the Constitution of Pakistan under Article 23, allow the citizens of Pakistan equal rights to acquire, hold, own and dispose of property, but reserve the right to intervene in the property rights if the ownership or disposal of property clash with what is perceived to be the broader public interest. The State is also responsible for providing protection to its citizens. Thus the State, under Article 24 of the Constitution of Pakistan could interfere in an individual’s property rights to protect the rights of those who are disadvantaged in the areas of ownership and devolution i.e., women and children. However, such pro-active involvement has not been evidenced either in the case laws reviewed or the codified laws

Women’s land ownership and control have important connections with their empowerment in Pakistan’s agricultural context. However, the link between these has largely remained unexplored; and there has been negligible research to determine how many women own or control land in Pakistan. The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) carried out a multiple pronged national study in 2007-09 to fill this knowledge gap and to examine the causality behind women’s land ownership and empowerment. The research focused on women’s rights vis-à-vis the inheritance framework of private agrarian land.

This Policy Brief discusses and analyzes the laws applicable to property rights (of women) in Pakistan like the Contract Act 1872, Transfer of Property Act 1882, Registration Act 1908, West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat Application) Act 1962, Hanafi law, Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 and the Customary Laws and international conventions like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The author observes that in the few instances where the courts have taken supportive decisions towards women, they are not based on the perception of women being equal citizens but based on the perception that women are weak, illiterate, and dependent, in need of protection and ill equipped to handle property matters.

Government policies like the National Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women does not focus specifically on issues around women’s ownership and access to land despite the critical acknowledged link between this and poverty.

Recognising the severity of the policy gap between structural impediments to women’s empowerment and concrete action plans, the paper concludes by giving these recommendations:


	Application of a Civil Code taking inheritance out of the purview of Muslim Personal law;
	In a divorce situation not only should maintenance be provided for a certain period of time (e.g. five years), but there should also be an equal division of immovable property acquired during the validity of the marriage;
	Minimize delays in adjudication of divorce matters;
	Increased awareness campaigns; and
	Government policy support.

eldis:A41269;Conserving land, protecting water;;"Following from the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture project, this book examines the relationships and linkages between land use and water management and social systems. Given that agriculture is the largest economic sector in many developing countries, this volume provides innovative ideas for the prevention of land degradation and for improving the sustainability of food production in the developing world. It focuses on positive examples of sustainable use of natural resources and is aimed at the non-specialist scientist.Some of the key issues discussed by the authors include:

    the status of the world’s ecosystems with respect to land and water resources and global patterns of land and water degradation
    improved management options at different scales - both through theoretical contexts and practical case studies 
    what were the driving forces and necessary conditions for the case studies presented to be successful?

A number of conclusions noted demonstrate that:

    improved land management can be good for both agricultural livelihoods and water resources simultaneously
    mitigation of land degradation can result in significant increases in water productivity, and this can be achieved using existing technologies and approaches
    positive results cannot occur without an understanding the socio-political contexts of the area. 

Some of the main recommendations highlight the need for: 

    policy and local level interventions that can stimulate resource-conserving agriculture that improves land and water productivity and works with long term ecosystem sustainability thinking
    the understanding of land use at the landscape level and managing these as a suite of potential activities with ecosystems in common
    human societies to be recognised as integral components of these landscapes 
    taking the right steps now in agriculture water management as it will significantly reduce poor people’s vulnerability to climate change by reducing water-related risks.

eldis:A41444;The economics and politics of land reforms in Malawi: a case study of the Community Based Rural Land Development Programme;;"It is estimated that up to 84% of Malawians earn their livelihoods directly from agriculture - it contributes over 90% to export earnings, 40% to GDP and accounts for 85% of total employment. While the advent of              democratisation in May 1994 provided a rare opportunity to address the chronic imbalances in the patterns of land ownership and distribution, the major development  strategies that the government has since implemented have shied away from addressing the land question.The Community Based Rural Land Development Programme (CBRLDP) stands out as the most significant intervention that has been implemented in postcolonial Malawi to address the highly unequal land ownership patterns. This paper examines the impact of this programme for the successful implementation of future land reform initiatives.The study demonstrates that success in promoting pro-poor growth and development is not merely a matter of conjuring good institutions - their design and implementation critically depends on agents and agencies to implement them. Key policy implications include:

    land reforms without a well-thought-out supportive infrastructure in the short to medium terms are unlikely to be sustainable. This is to say that land reform is more than just access to land: it must be accompanied by access to non-land assets; access to credit; access to extension  services; and training of beneficiaries in modern farming techniques
    the functioning of other markets such as transport, output, labour and financial are critical for households to maximise the benefits from access to land and improved tenure security. Reforms of this nature are therefore unlikely to generate substantial benefits in terms of investments, incomes and sustainable livelihoods without the accompanying financial assistance to farmers through access to other agricultural inputssuch as fertilisers and improved seeds
    a gender-balanced selection of beneficiaries would enhance the positive impact of the CBRLDP. The participation of female headed households in the CBRLDP is limited yet the economic analysis reveals that male headed households invest less in hybrid maize production compared to femaleheaded households. The level of education of  households is also important. The higher the level of education of the household the higher the uptake of modern technology such as hybrid maize and chemical fertiliser
    the range of stakeholders involved matters in determining outcomes, successes and failures. Understanding the interface between formal and informal institutions in the context of the reforms is vital particularly in terms of anticipating and dealing with unexpected consequences.

eldis:A26313;Land degradation, stocking rates and conservation policies in the communal rangelands of Botswana and Zimbabwe;;This article suggests that communual rangeland management policies in Botswana and Zimbabwe are based on incorrect technical assumptions about the stability of semiarid rangelands,  the nature of rangeland degradation, and the benefits of destocking. Consequently, inappropriate policies, stressing the need to destock and stabilise the rangelands, are pursued.Acknowledgement of the great instability but intrinsic resilience of rangeland would encourage the Governments to more favourable regard the opportunistic stocking strategies of the agro-pastoralists of the Communual Areas. Howeve, degradation of rangelands is occurring, although at varying rates. This justifies the promotion of a 'tracking strategy', in which livestock densities are encouraged to follow more closely than at present, variations in rainfall.The establishment of grazing territories controlled by specific 'communities' may be a prerequisite for the promotion of the tracking strategy, and for communal rangeland management and improvement. However, the establishment of such territories must take into account social equity, institutional problems and transaction  costs, as well as spatial and temporal variation in rangeland resources. ;"N.

Ten case studies were conducted in variouscountries in the he Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Saheland at UN and EU level. These investigate whether the link between climate change and human security/conflict is being addressed through targeted policies. The studies show that so far there are few specific policies addressing this interface.

eldis:A25434;Indonesia's palm oil subsector;;A recommendation: Indonesia should repeal its export tax on crude palm oil and discontinue buffer stock operations and directed sales from public estates. It is time for Indonesia to complete the evolution from public interventions in the palm oil market to private sector initiative in response to international price signals.Debate on Indonesia's palm oil policy was stimulated by a sharp increase in cooking oil prices in 1994-95 and a resulting increase in the export tax rate on crude palm oil. Palm oil has been one of the fastest growing subsectors in Indonesia. In two decades, annual output grew from less than 400,000 tons to more than 4 million. Using a quantitative model, Larson analyzes the effect of government policies, including the export tax, buffer stock operations by the BULOG (the national logistics agency), and directed sales from public estates.Larson acknowledges the export tax's effectiveness in lowering domestic prices, but observes that its impact on inflation and consumer welfare is minimal. Cooking oil accounts for only 1.4 percent of the consumer price index and welfare gains to consumers are small (less than $1 per capita annually) because the importance of cooking oil has declined in the household budget of even the poorest households. (It is 4 percent of the household budget of the poorest 20 percent of the rural population.)The tax has also had the unintended effect of transferring income (up to US$99 million a year) from oil palm growers - 22 percent of them smallholders - located primarily off Java.The structure of the tax discourages local processing by squeezing margins for processing. And determining tax rates on palm oil products independent from the underlying crude palm oil price creates uncertainty about marketing margins for processors, inhibiting effective risk management.Larson recommends repealing the tax. He also recommends discontinuing buffer stock operations and directed sales from public estates because they are ineffective at lowering domestic prices and affect investment by creating needless uncertainty.Larson concludes with recommendations on investment policy. Direct incentives (in the form of subsidized loans) to private investors have been an indirect instrument for overcoming investment risks and uncertainties, but investors should no longer need those incentives.Instead, Indonesia's government should focus more on alleviating obstacles to private investment, such as lack of rural infrastructure, land titles, and sovereign risk. The Bank might be of assistance in this area.The review for this paper - a product of the Commodity Policy and Analysis Unit, International Economics Department, and the Agriculture Operations Division, East Asia and Pacific, Country Department III - was conducted to help the debate on Indonesia's palm oil policy.

A notable outcome in both India and the Sudan is that sustainable development practises have not only resulted in environmental developments, but socioeconomic conditions have also improved and communities are coordinating and managing their own adaptation projects.The authors provides a concise summary of lessons learned for climate change adaptation in other regions including:understanding local vulnerabilities to implement appropriate strategiesestablishing community based institutions and organisations to improve participationdeveloping human resources through training and community educationmaintaining support of regional policy frameworks. ;;;Climate Change, International Institute for Sustainable Development ;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"environment;climate change;land;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";;"IND;SDN;202;034";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A21640;http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2003/envsec_livelihoods_3.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpdf%2F2003%2Fenvsec_livelihoods_3.pdf;;;;"case studies;climate change adaptation key sectors;Environment and natural resource management;sustainable development;climate change;policy and academic;Environment;natural resource management drylands;Climate Change Adaptation;climate change adaptation and vulnerability;Climate change;drylands management;Environment Natural Resource Access and Management;climate change adaptation community based;community adaptation"
eldis:A66194;Large-scale Land Deals, Food Security and Local Livelihoods;;"CAADP Policy Brief 10by Kate Wellard-Dyer
Large-scale foreign land acquisitions - land grabs - are major and real concerns for African populations.   The consequences of land deals are highly significant for local populations and the environment. Some see economic opportunities for local communities through employment and income generated from leasing or selling land. Others see land alienation as a major threat to local livelihoods, food security and the environment. The question is whether ‘win-win’ models exist - benefitting local people as well as providing an economic return to investors.  This policy brief draws on latest research by Future Agricultures. It asks: What are the drivers behind large-scale land deals in Africa and who are the main players? What is the impact of land deals on livelihoods and food security of existing land users? What can governments do to protect smallholder livelihoods?

eldis:A74413;Climate change and water resources planning, development and management in Zimbabwe;;"Water is central to the Zimbabwean economy, people's livelihoods and their social well-being; its availability and reliability is a function of highly variable climatic conditions. Irrigated agriculture is the major water using sector while rain fed agriculture depends on reliable rainfall.
Agriculture not only has links to other economic sectors such as industry, but it is also important at household level because it employs the majority of the population. Power production which underpins most other production sectors depends to a large part on the flow of the Zambezi River either for hydropower generation or for the cooling of thermal power stations.
Even mining, a growth sector, ultimately relies on water for both processing and electricity production. The government of Zimbabwe has long recognized the threat from climate change and joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 2009.
It is currently preparing a National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) that is intended to mainstream climate change thinking into all key economic sectors and to bring about an integrated response across all economic sectors.
Zimbabwe strategy will largely be based around adapting to the threats from climate change so that detrimental economic and social impacts are minimized and opportunities are seized. Given the implications of climate change for the hydrological cycle and the centrality of water to the economy and to social well-being, water needs to be at the core of the NCCRS. This Issues Paper, requested by the former Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management as a recommendation of the NWP, will contribute to the NCCRS by examining opportunities for adaptation to climate change in the water resources sector, using both structural and non-structural measures. It uses models to provide preliminary estimates of the possible impacts of climate change in 2050 and 2080 on these water resources.
A number of opportunities to adapt to these impacts are discussed. Many of these adaptation opportunities constitute no-regrets actions, in that they are actions that are worth undertaking in their own right, irrespective of the severity of impacts from climate change.

eldis:A14085;Gender and access to land;;This paper explores gender and issues of land access and administration in rural development. It argues that increasing social, economic and technological changes are requiring a re-examination of the institutional arrangements used to administer who has rights to what resources and under what conditions. It is frequently the case that gender issues are left out or misunderstood in such situations, with often long lasting and very negative results.Findings and conclusions include:most donor-funded projects dealing with land administration concern themselves with only one aspect of land administration, principally that of administering land rights through some form of identification and  documentation of rights: they do not usually address other aspects such as land use planning and enforcement, and land valuation and taxation, or do so only marginallyproviding gender inclusiveness in access to land can benefit families, communities, and nations through, for example:increased economic opportunitiesincreased investment in land and food productionimproved family security during transitionsbetter housing and land stewardshipbenefits, however, can only be fully realised if the strategies adopted for improving gender inclusion work in practice. Decision-makers and project teams need to know:the quality and distribution of rights in landthe economic and cultural impediments that limit effective and secure access to landthe benefits that can be achieved by enhancing gender inclusionthe options that exist for providing more equitable access to landthe implications of implementing these optionswithout changes to the attitudes of much of the population, traditional practices are likely to continue regardless of the formulation of new policies or the enactment of new legislationas the land tenure issues grow increasingly complex and become more diverse, land administrators have a responsibility to know more about the issues and to do more to ensure that the systems for administering property rights serve all sectors of societies wellThe paper presents specific recommendations for different types of actors in order to achieve the following goals:for development organisations:improve the environment for gender inclusivenessimprove opportunities for gender inclusivenessfor land administration professionalsinclude all sectors of the populationremove barriers to access to informationaddress the obstacles to participationwork with the local communities[adapted from author] ;"S.

eldis:A65123;Water security and climate resilient development: investing in water security for growth and development;;"This technical paper has been produced by the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) to support the implementation of the Strategic Framework for Water Security and Climate Resilience Development, developed by the African Union through AMWOC. The framework itself seeks to help with the identification, development and mainstreaming of ‘no/low regrets’ investment strategies, and to make development planning activities more resilient to climate change. In providing detail on the concepts and methodologies underpinning each step of the framework, as well as information on financial strategies available, this technical paper supports the frameworks’ goals of achieving water security and climate resilient development through the strengthening of institutional capacity, improving knowledge and enhancing partnerships. The paper comprises of twelve chapters providing comprehensive and detailed guidance to the various aspects of implementing the framework:

    the use and construction of climate change and socioeconomic scenarios in development planning
    how to make the case for water security and climate resilient development
    stakeholder perspectives, with examples of stakeholder roles and responsibilities
    climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability assessments
    identifying opportunities for building resilience in existing development programmes
    finding new and innovative investment opportunities
    ensuring robust investment options in the face of uncertain climate changes through risk management and characterisation
    single- and multi-criterion approaches to appraising the economics of investment options
    the integration of no/low regrets investments into the development process
    developing financing and investment strategies, which looks at the cost of water security and climate resilient development, infrastructure funding, and examples of financing strategies
    mainstreaming climate resilience in development planning
    lessons learned, as well as monitoring and evaluation – the iterative nature of these aspects is emphasised in that they should provide continuity and informative input into subsequent assessments and activities.

eldis:A27531;Effects of Agricultural Commercialization on Food Crop Input Use and Productivity in Kenya;;Analyses the effects of smallholder commercialization on foodcrop input use and productivity in rural Kenya. The main research issues were: To examine the determinants of smallholder fertilizer use on food crops, with a focus on the effects of household and regional agricultural commercializationTo examine the determinants of food crop productivity, again with a focus on the effects of commercializationTo discuss the implications of the findings for policy and additional research necessary to improve the contribution of cash cropping to rural food productivity growth and food security.The principle findings of the study are:The degree of smallholder commercialization differs widely across zones in Kenya. Even within a particular zone, households differ significantly in the degree of commercialization Crop commercialization is not uniformly correlated with landholding or area cultivated among the households surveyedHousehold agricultural commercialization, ceteris paribus, generally has a significant and positive effect on food crop fertilizer use and productivityThe effects of particular cash crops on these variables was found to differ markedly by region, independent of the household-level effects of agricultural commercialization As expected, smallholder adoption of hybrid maize seed, frequently in combination with fertilizer, was shown to have significant positive effects on productivity per unit of landThere is a meaningful payoff to formal education in terms of food crop productivity. Fertilizer use was also found to positively associated with educationIn general, the results indicate that discussions of agricultural commercialization and its effects were positive in most cases. But this conclusion should not be overgeneralized. What matters is what kind of commercialization, how particular schemes are organized, and their effects on smallholder access to inputs, management advice, market outlets, price levels and price risks, etc.The most important pathways by which crop commercialization may improve food crop productivity are hypothesized to be:LI> Crop commercialization provides a source of cash that allows the household to overcome credit-related constraints on the purchase of fertilizer and other cash inputsParticipation in a cash crop (e.g., coffee) generally improves the household’s access to inputs distributed through the cash crop marketing firm (e.g., coffee cooperatives), which may result in the household using some of that input on food crop productionCash income from commercialized production patterns also facilitates the ability to purchase draft oxen and traction equipment that may promote food crop productivity.The emerging picture indicates the benefits of attempting to address the risks and market failure aspects necessary to make increased agricultural commercialization viable rather than accept these risks and market failures as inherent, unalterable features of the African context that require a food first production orientation. Increased access to food depends on income growth, and for the majority of African smallholders dependent on agriculture, income growth is tied to productivity growth in agriculture, i.e., increasing the value of production generated from available household resources. A major task for future research is to understand better how successful commercialization arrangements linking smallholders and marketing/processing firms have been structured so that their successful ingredients can be replicated and incorporated more broadly into commercialization strategies in other regions. This is likely to yield high payoffs in terms of increasing agricultural productivity and food security. [author]A summary versionof the paper is also available ;"P.J. Strasberg

eldis:A74913;Assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the Cadastral Survey Program of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources;;"The slow progress of the Cadastral Survey Program in the Philippines has been associated with implementation issues that have affected the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. A review of the processes, procedures, and existing institutional set-up in the conduct of cadastral surveys helped identify factors behind the slow progress and delays in implementation. These factors include the tedious procurement process and procedures; slow verification of survey reports/returns; peace and order situation in areas subject to cadastral survey; lack of cooperation from the local government units; and inaccurate and dated land database.

This paper assessed the accomplishments of the cadastral survey program and estimated the funding requirements needed to finish the remaining surveys based on data and information made available by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources/Land Management Bureau and other government agencies. Based on the findings, recommendations on how the program may be improved were presented.

eldis:A13926;HIV/Aids and its impact on land issues in Malawi;;This paper investigates how HIV/AIDS affects land access, utilisation and control in Malawi, with a particular focus upon vulnerable groups.  It presents findings on the effect of HIV/AIDS on land holding, household responses to HIV/AIDS (to ensure their ability to continue using land as a resource), implications for tenure, effect of HIV/AIDS on land administration institutions, and the role of national legal and  policy frameworks.The paper recommends:Firstly, that there is a need to raise the profile of the challenge posed by HIV/AIDS to poverty reduction.  Government, NGOs and other civil society entities need to develop a collaborative strategy for publicising and addressing the impact of HIV/AIDS on people’s access to land, and their ability to retain and make productive use of it.Secondly, the Malawi poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) should award households that are badly affected by HIV/AIDS special consideration in the reduction initiatives.  At present, mentions of HIV/AIDS in the PRSP appear to be add-ons, but further work is required to include a stronger analysis of HIV/AIDS and to integrate it into the paper.Thirdly, key laws, policies and development strategies should be reviewed to insure that provisions marginalising those affected by HIV/AIDS are amended, in particular:local governments should have the authority and financing to expand extension and service facilities to make them accessible to people who are ill or caring for those who are illthe provision that ‘those with the ability and resources’ is a qualification for people to be awarded secure access to land should be removed from the national land policythe potential down-falls of the proposed demand-driven extension policy should be recognised, and should not be introduced without parallel efforts to support marginalised families, who may not be in a position to demand servicesmeasures should be taken to improve the abilities of those affected by HIV/AIDS to have secure access to land, to improve their ability to retain land and to utilise it effectivelycontradictory laws should be harmonised, in particular to ensure consistency in the provisions relating to the empowerment of women and childrenmore focused studies are needed to shed light on the implications of the greater reliance on land by those with a previously more varied livelihood strategy and are now badly affected by HIV/AIDSHIV/AIDS should be mainstreamed into all development planning, including the national land policy and draft land bill.  To do so, a review of the land legal framework, with reference to the actual impacts of HIV/AIDS on people’s ability to access, retain and utilise land is recommendedmore effort should be channelled towards mainstreaming HIV/AIDS within land administration institutions, both internally and in their programme workthe gender sensitivity in the proposed national land policy should be implemented, and should assume a degree of gender bias in favour of women in order to reverse the prevailing situation.  Civic education should be focused on improving the situation of widows and orphansan audit of existing literature is required in order to collate current information and identify gapsan audit of functional support mechanisms available to those affected by HIV/AIDS is required.  They should be assessed for effectiveness and strategies for augmenting them developed, so that subsequent development efforts support rather than replace existing mechanisms[adapted from the author] ;"S.

eldis:A33773;Oil and mining in violent places: why voluntary codes for companies don’t guarantee human rights;;"This paper investigates the extent to which private companies operating in conflict zones can contribute to Human Rights abuses. In addressing this issue, it focuses on four voluntary frameworks – the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Global Reporting Initiative and, most relevantly, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.The research finds that:

    it is clear from the numerous cases where extractive companies have been blamed for complicity in human rights abuses, there are grounds for serious concern about the human rights implications of companies’ operations
    in response to this, many major extractive companies have signed up to voluntary human rights frameworks of the kind described in this briefing paper
    as an attempt to offer a comprehensive and credible answer, they have so far failed as no voluntary framework deals adequately with the vital issue of material support by companies to armed groups. 

The authors conclude that there needs to be an enforceable international standard which ensures that a company discloses any material support to state security forces or other armed groups and shows that such support has been provided to meet an explicit legal requirement.

eldis:A35175;Access to water - the impact of climate change on small municipalities;;"Although there are many uncertainties around quantitative assessments of climate change impact and water resource management, what is certain is that the climate is changing and this will have an effect on water resources. 
This case study considers the economic consequences of water resource scarcity, particularly as it relates to the poor and small municipalities. The author is concerned that, in the case of water, economic principles where price adjustments to an increasingly scarce resource will balance demand, do not apply. 
Currently, most countries adopt free or subsidised water for the poor which is accommodated through a cross subsidy within the municipal tariff structure. However, the likely rate of increase in tariff due to water scarcity resulting from (projected) reduced rainfall will be too much of a burden for the small number of high-end users in small municipalities. Coupled with inflationary increases, the majority middle- and low-end users are also unlikely to be able to meet the dramatic increases. The methodology outlined in this paper will assist municipal planners to evaluate these financial impacts due to climate change and develop appropriate strategies to ensure the sustainability and affordability of long term water supplies. In addition, policy intervention at a national level may be needed in order to sustain small communities’ ability to provide affordable water to their poorer members.  ";P.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), production on smallholder farms is critical to the food security of the rural poor and contributes the majority of food production at the national level.

National policies and local interventions have pro- found impacts on the opportunities and constraints that affect smallholders.

However, policy frameworks that aim to improve food security and rural livelihoods in the developing world face many uncertainties and often fail.

The formulation of effective policies needs adequate information on how different options affect the complex issues surrounding food security and sustainable development.

eldis:A59873;Using adaptation tipping points to prepare for climate change and sea level rise: a case study in the Netherlands;;"Studies on the impact of climate change and sea level rise usually rake climate scenarios as their starting point. To support long-term water management planning int he Netherlands, this paper starts at the opposite end of the effect chain. The study refers to three aspects of water management:

    flood defence
    drinking water supply
    protection of the Rotterdam harbour.

The authors examine whether, and for how long, current water management strategies will continue to be effective under different climate change scenarios. This was done by applying the concept of ‘adaptation tipping points’ – if the magnitude of change is such that the current management strategy can no longer meet its objectives. By applying this approach, the authors answer the following basic questions: what are the first issues that will be faced as a result of climate change and when can these be expected. The results show that climate change and the rise in sea level are more likely to cause a threat to the fresh water supply in the west of the Netherlands than flooding. ";"J., C., J Kwadijk

eldis:A8724;Rewriting forest history in West Africa;;Kissidougou in Guinea, West Africa, is characterised by so-called 'forest islands', relics - it was assumed -of original dense forest cover. It was also assumed that local cultivation practice was to blame for the destruction of the trees. However, as collaborative research led by the School of Oriental and African Studies, the Institute of Development Studies and Guinean researchers discovered, villagers had a different story to tell: that the forest islands had in fact been established over several generations as part of a process of deliberate forest management. Archives and air-photographs backed the villagers' perspective and investigation of land-use practices showed how landscapes were being enriched. ;"James Fairhead

eldis:A40627;From risk to resilience: Understanding the costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction under changing climatic conditions;;"This paper evaluates the costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction in the context of climate change through an analysis of case studies in India, Nepal and Pakistan. The paper focuses on water related disasters and the manner in which they may change as a consequence of climate change. The paper highlights that the evidence presenting the economic impacts of climate change and disasters is accumulating rapidly. It is now widely recognized that recurrent disasters represent a major factor in undermining the ability of regions, nations and the global community to meet basic development goals. As a result, there is both a need and a demand for analytical frameworks such as cost benefit analysis that can support decision-making with regard to investments in climate and other disaster risk reduction investments.The methodological approach of the paper has the following key elements:

    scoping: an intensive scoping process to identify locations and risks that can form a representative basis for detailed cases
    vulnerability and capacity analysis: a systematic process within case study areas, including development of semi-quantitative vulnerability indices, to identify vulnerable groups and the different dimensions of vulnerability
    shared learning dialogues within identified case areas: continuous meetings with communities and key actors that allow the movement from the analysis of vulnerability to clear identification of the alternative strategies for disaster risk reduction 
    systematic qualitative approaches for evaluating trade-offs (broad costs and benefits) between alternative strategies for risk reduction: who benefits, who loses and why?
    Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) using quantitative probabilistic techniques for evaluating the costs and benefits of different approaches to disaster risk reduction. A core economic and hazard-modeling element and includes techniques for evaluating the impacts of climate change in data limited context.

The paper concludes that, the benefits of investing in disaster risk management substantially exceed the costs. In most cases investigated, benefit/cost ratios are positive and in some instances may be well above those achieved through other common development investments. This finding holds true for an array of interventions that range across a spectrum from insurance to early warning and from distributed responses at the village level to large-scale infrastructure. Investing in lower cost forms of risk reduction that are designed to increase the resiliency of livelihoods, housing and other infrastructure at the household and community level may be among the most economically effective avenues for reducing risks and thereby supporting adaptation to climate change.

eldis:A69777;Land valuation and perceptions of land sales prohibition in Ethiopia;;"This study investigates attitudes towards legalizing land sales and Willingness to Accept (WTA) sales prices and compensation prices for land among smallholder households in four different areas in the Oromia and SNNP Regions in the southern highlands of Ethiopia.

Household panel data from 2007 and 2012 are used. The large majority of the sample prefers land sales to remain illegal, and the resistance to legalizing land sales increased from 2007 to 2012. In the same period, perceived median real land values increased sharply but also exhibit substantial local variation.

Land loss aversion is associated with higher land values and less willingness to sell land if land sales were to become legal. The substantial increase in perceived land values, high economic growth and outmigration of youth have yet to persuade the rural population in southern Ethiopia to open the land sales market.

eldis:A69678;The challenge of establishing REDD+ on the ground: Insights from 23 subnational initiatives in six countries;;"Since 2007, it has been hoped that REDD+ would deliver on the 3E+ criteria (effectiveness, efficiency, equity, social and environmental co?benefits) for strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This report highlights that the early enthusiasm for REDD+ has dissipated among some stakeholders – this is largely attributed to the failure to attain an international climate change agreement.

In its Global Comparative Study on REDD+ (GCS), CIFOR undertook a survey of 23 subnational REDD+ initiatives in six countries in order to examine their strategies and approaches, the nature of the challenges they faced, and how they intended to overcome them. The study found that the 23 initiatives were persisting in their efforts to reduce local deforestation and forest degradation, as well as deliver on a wide range of goals. However, questions remain about whether and how the REDD+ concept will persist and evolve.

eldis:A69770;Urban land markets in Southern African cities;;"The cities in southern Africa reflect the rapid urbanisation characteristic of sub-Saharan Africa in general. Angola, Botswana and South Africa have the highest levels of urbanisation with about 60% of their population living in cities in 2010 and this percentage is expected to rise to about 80% by 2050.

The main drivers of urban growth in the region are natural increase (population growth), peri-urban rural settlements inclusion within city boundaries and rural to urban migration, both within and between countries, although migration in southern Africa is largely circular and seasonal with people moving between their homes in rural areas and workplaces in industrial, commercial and mining towns.

The study indicates that in southern African cities, the formal sector is unable to meet the demand for urban land amongst the majority of residents – the urban poor. The bulk of the demand for land is met through the informal market, which is open to all income groups. However, neither the formal nor the informal system is working well for the poor. For example, in Maseru the commercialisation of the informal market excludes the poorest households. Understanding the factors that affect how land markets work can help us to identify interventions that may help poor people to access suitable land and adequate accommodation in cities.

Urban land markets in southern African cities are influenced by the dynamics related to two different tenure systems:

• Customary tenure of communal land that is not formally registered;

• Statutory tenure of land that is registered, with land rights being held through a freehold or a leasehold.

The study states that efficient and equitable land markets are necessary for well-functioning cities. However, examples in this case study show how, in an effort to meet the increased demand for land in peri-urban areas, government interventions and a lack of capacity to adequately administer and manage land have distorted the operation of urban land markets. This has increased the gap between rich and poor in terms of access to land. Examples further suggest that unlimited market forces also exclude the poor – in both formal and informal markets.

Recommendations for a transitional approach from informal to formal urban land markets identified in the research study include:


	Create institutional structures that will facilitate the gradual transition from informal to formal markets.
	 Devolve certain municipal functions to these transitional institutional structures, such as the registration of occupancy, enforcement of basic land use regulations, dispute settlement and simple title registers by local chiefs or their equivalents.
	Make sure that the transitional institutional structures permit access to property development finance and are supported to initially undertake land management and planning at the sub-municipal level.
	Develop land supply and administrative systems that reinforce emerging market relations whilst also ensuring that such markets work for the common good.

The paper focuses on a number of variables that will be affected by climate change, including, water resources, the El Nino, ecosystems, human health, agriculture and overall vulnerability.The paper makes the following main points:complex climatic patterns intermingled with land-use and land-cover change, make it difficult to identify common patterns of vulnerability to climate change in the regionthe cryosphere which is composed of glaciers in the high Andes and three major ice areas in southern South America, may be severely affected by global warmingdeforestation in the Amazon Basin is likely to reduce precipitation because of a decrease in evapotranspiration, leading to important runoff losses in areas within and beyond the Amazon basinsome studies based on model experiments suggest that under climate change the hydrological cycle will be more intense, with changes in the distribution of extreme heavy rainfall, wet spells, and dry spellsmore El Niño-like mean conditions will be experiencedsome adverse impacts on species that can be related to regional changes in climate have already been observedsubsistence farming could be severely threatened in some parts of Latin America, such as northeastern Brazilit is likely that increases in temperature will reduce crop yields in the region by shortening the crop cycleon longer time scales, El Niño and La Niña cause changes in disease vector populations and the incidence of water-borne diseases in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Venezuelathe adaptive capacity of socioeconomic systems in Latin America is very low, particularly with respect to extreme climate events, and vulnerability is high.[adapted from author] ;"M.

eldis:A69621;Urban land development in practice ;;"Developers study the property market carefully and then, based on the property cycle, and risk and profit calculations, they acquire land and develop it, with a specific product in mind. Municipalities play a governance role, and are mandated to ensure that the development is in line with government policies and development plans for the area.

Deciding whether to submit land development applications to the municipality via the Ordinance route, or to the provincial government via the Development Facilitation Act 1995 (DFA) route, is pivotal in terms of what, how, when and where development will take place.

This case study draws on research that sought to understand the process of urban land development in practice, from the perspectives of developers and municipalities. The case study focuses on large development companies and consortia involved in different types of development, with specific reference to three development projects in Gauteng province (Waterberg Golf and Wildlife Estate, Cosmo City, Johannesburg and Jabulani Mall, Soweto)

Developing urban land is a complex process that depends on a variety of political, social and economic factors. Some of the key factors that influence decision-making in development projects are:


	the level of political support for the project, for example there was strong political support for both Jabulani Mall and Cosmo City in Gauteng province
	ability of the developer to sell the plan to the municipality as meeting broader social objectives
	ability to mediate between the multiple agendas of stakeholders
	the networks and relationships between municipalities, planning consultants, developers and other stakeholders
	the ability to identify and move in on niche markets, in order not to miss out on a profitable venture
	the availability of capital, which is a requirement in all development projects
	ownership of and access to land
	the development has to comply with government regulations relating to Environmental Impact Assessments and Social Impact Assessments and policies related to land use planning


Some of the recommendations the study proposes are:


	municipalities should take initiative and make suggestions for how the development could be made more sustainable, inclusive and functional, to act more as development facilitators
	planners should develop plans with municipal officials to ensure there is agreement as to how the plan could focus on inclusiveness, equity and sustainability
	politicians should focus on developing and popularising municipalities’ policies rather than playing a major role in decision-making regarding development projects, since they often lack the technical knowledge to make informed decisions

eldis:A37895;Moving beyond forestry laws in Sahelian countries;;"Sahelian rural populations’ needs are sourced from on-farm indigenous tree species. However, access, use and management of indigenous tree species within their territories are restricted by forestry laws. This has built suspicion and discontent between foresters and natural resource users. Natural resource users argue that they own the trees on their farms; in contrast, the state claims to own protected indigenous trees on farms as stipulated in the forestry laws. These mismatches have served to increase deforestation despite stringent penalties and use of permits and licenses. This brief argues that there is a need to move beyond these forestry laws to find new sustainable solutions. It is asserted that to deal with the mismatches between foresters and natural resource users, Sahelian governments should work with rural communities and other stakeholders to amend their forestry laws to: 

    facilitate negotiation support among stakeholders 
    operationalise decentralisation and power transfer initiatives for management of agroforests 
    recognise and facilitate formulation and use of local by-laws to control access, use and tree management 
    use permits and licenses to regulate access and use of indigenous trees only in state controlled “classified” forests 
    provide extension services to natural resources users
    promote agroforestry as a business 
    review land and tree tenure laws 
    enhance collaborative work among Sahelian governments, development partners and research institutions

It is noted that, in countries where natural resource users and by-laws have been recognised and integrated in conventional law, there is improved access, use and management of indigenous tree species.  ";"T. Yatich

eldis:A10673;Getting the lion's share from tourism: private sector-community partnerships in Namibia.;;"In a number of developing countries, partnerships between the private sector and local communities are becoming more and more common, especially as communities are increasingly gaining rights to wildlife and other valuable tourism assets on their land through national policy changes on land tenure. In other cases, partnerships are developing on private land as tourism operators recognise that not only is local support essential for the long-term maintenance of the tourism assets on which the industry depends, but that many communities have cultural resources which can greatly enhance or diversify and existing tourism product.In Namibia, recently introduced communal conservancies legislation, which gives local people use rights to wildlife and tourism on communal land, coupled with a national programme on community-based natural resource management, provides a framework through which both biodiversity conservation and rural development goals can be achieved by enabling communities to benefit from commercial ventures on their land. Partnerships are therefore being encouraged between the private sector and communities in order to both improve the standard of living of local communities and ensure the long-term economic viability of the new conservancies.This report reviews the current experience of private sector-community partnerships within the tourism industry in Namibia and provides guidelines for the development of future partnerships. The report is based on fieldwork in Namibia in late 1999 and early 2000 and on discussions with a number of key stakeholders in the sector.This report is divided into three volumes,:volume one is a background report on the tourism industry and policy context for community based tourism in Namibiavolume two contains practical guidelines and recommendations for both communities and the private sector for the development of future partnerships, based on the analysis in the preceding chaptervolume three comprises a detailed description, including a summary of strengths and weaknesses, of all the
existing partnerships in Namibia that were identified during the course of the fieldwork. This alone provides a valuable source of previously undocumented information and is the basis for the analysis and guidelines in volumes one and two of the report.The report is available in in 3 volumes: Volume 1Volume 2Volume 3.[adapted from authors] ";"D.

eldis:A101128;South Africa’s drought preparedness in the water sector: too little too late? ;;South Africa experiences droughts on a regular basis, often associated with significant negative impacts on society and the economy. Droughts can be forecast, and South African climate scientists have been developing computer-generated models to forecast El Niño-induced droughts. Even so, there is a tendency to implement remedial interventions when droughts occur, rather than implementing proactive and preventative strategies. Being reactive seems to be a defining feature of South African water-resource management. This has also been the case with the 2015/2016 drought. What is more, the forecasting capability of South Africa seems to be under strain as more and more weather monitoring stations and river gauges are stolen or vandalised and not replaced. This makes it difficult to gather data for extreme weather event forecasting. One way of increasing this capability is through collaboration with citizens to build a citizen-science data repository. This can enhance scientists’ and the government’s capacity to forecast droughts.Recommendations:South Africa should adopt a long-term, national drought policy and strategy to improve the country’s response to future droughtsthe computer-generated models that determine operating rules, which influence water restrictions for various users, need regular updating and improvementthe drought response unit of the DWS needs to become more proactive in its preparedness for droughtsa formalised knowledge exchange platform should be established that consolidates scientific and modelling forecasting capability in support of drought preparedness ;"R.

The report discusses the role that sustainable forest management can play in mitigating climate change. The report is divided into the following sections:the scientific consensus on climate outlined while the scientific uncertainties remaining about future carbon fluxes involving vegetation and soil are highlighteda description of the effects of climate change on forests and the role of forests in regulating water flow, stabilising soils and providing habitat for biodiversityan outline of past attempts to establish a global convention on forests, and introduces the concept of sustainable forest managementa discussion of international climate policy and the post-2012 policy scenario in particular as it relates to carbon sinksa discussion of afforestation, reforestation, and other land use change with a focus  on deforestationa description of strategies and techniques for adaptive management, and a consideration of how this is supported by public understanding of forestry and climate change.The report concludes that forests are vitally important in addressing climate change because forest ecosystems affect climate through the absorption of carbon in wood, leaves and soil. The report makes the following policy recommendations:halting deforestationreducing illegal loggingsequestration projectsreducing uncertainties in climate change sciencesustainable forest managementThe report also highlights requirements that must be met to overcome barriers to implementing these recommendations including:an accurate valuation of the environmental services that are provided by forest ecosystemsparticipatory decision-making processes involving all stakeholdersflexible and reflexive policies in order to adapt to future climate changesthe development of knowledge transfer partnershipsconsideration of wider policy objectives, such as poverty eradication and assisting developing nations to adapt to climate change. ;"S.

eldis:A41531;Integrating women into mining operations: the examples of Newmont Ghana and Lonmin South Africa;;"Mining has not always had good press in the development arena, due to a history of inadequate environmental and social governance. This short paper argues that there is enormous opportunity to be had in including women in mining operations. The author looks at how International Finance Corporations’ (IFC) Gender Program was able to implement strategies to help two IFC mining clients better integrate women into their operations. The author highlights how in so doing, IFC has contributed to the clients’ sustainability objectives and to improved performance through greater gender diversity. The document also shows how important it is to be flexible when dealing with clients who have different impulses and requirements, and how to leverage colleagues for greater mainstreaming.The paper considers how to identify the drivers and market realities and lists 3 lessons learnt in the process: 

    for quick wins, start by implementing feasible objectives derived from client priorities 
    partner with other IFC colleagues to amplify actions and ensure greater gender mainstreaming

eldis:A75079;National industrialization in Philippine mining: review and suggestions ;;"Among the most daunting constraints mining has been facing is that it is a
generally extractive activity the way it has been traditionally practiced. This makes the country a mere exporter of raw materials to industrialized countries and unable to benefit from value-addition. To help address this problem, the national government has recently pronounced a long-term strategy of national industrialization in the mining sector. Among others, this strategy is intended to enable the sector to expand into processing3 and other downstream activities and transform lowvalue outputs of raw materials into processed products with higher value-added.

The paper reviewed national industrialization as a long-term strategy of mining development in the Philippines. The end purpose was to suggest immediate actions that can be undertaken for the promotion of national industrialization. The paper used secondary data and information from institutional sources and available relevant literature as well as primary data and information from institutional key informants.

The paper found that the knowledge base of the country required to pursue the national industrialization strategy is poor. The following studies therefore were suggested


	value chain analysis for the mining sector and its sub-sectors, including but not limited to the copper, nickel, gold and chromite industries
	development of community-based small and medium-scale operations in mining including the technology, financial, institutional and other forms of government support that could be provided to them
	analysis of resource rents in the mining sector and its subsectors that will determine, among others, how much royalty tax should be imposed on them
	evaluation of the appropriated export restrictions that may be imposed on the mining sector taking into consideration their economic, social and other impacts


In addition to the aforementioned research activities, the paper supports the institutional improvements that have been suggested by previous works. These include the strengthening of the organizational, legal, monitoring and enforcement other aspects of governance performed by government mining agencies.

eldis:A16783;Local institutions and rehabilitation of common lands in the Aravalli hills, Haryana;;"Legislation was passed in India in 1992 imparting constitutional status on Panchayati Raj (village-level local government) institutions.  This study attempts to assess the success and sustainability of such local institutions (particularly Village Forest Committees) in their attempts to rehabilitate common lands in the Aravalli hills in Haryana State, and to enact a transition from an ‘open access’ system to a community controlled regulated access system for governing the use of these lands.  It uses data from a household survey in ten project villages.Its findings include that: in all but two of the villages, members of scheduled castes and other backward castes were represented proportionately in the village committee in six of the villages, less than three of the nine to thirteen committee members were women members from disadvantaged sections of society and women attended Committee meetings but contributed little to the decision making process  women extension workers, whose role was to raise awareness and participation of women in the project, were only working in five of the ten villages; self-help groups for women were constituted only in the same five villages only one of the Comittees levied fines in cases of violation of rules regarding use of common lands; others were reluctant to do so because of the fear of becoming unpopular and the close-knit nature of the village community villagers reported that they were largely satisfied with the system of joint management of common lands in the Aravalli Project and 96 per cent said they would be willing to invest at least a quarter of their income from felling trees in the Project it was felt, especially by those from socially and economically disadvantaged groups, that the Committee and Government jointly, rather than either party individually, would be best equipped to look after the common resources. The paper concludes by proposing changes to the legislation surrounding the Village Forest Committees.  It suggests that at least 50 per cent of Committee membership should be reserved for women, in order to promote women’s participation; and that at least two thirds of the members of the Committee should be common land users, in order to prevent powerful non-user groups influencing decisions.

eldis:A69976;Integrated agriculture enhances farm productivity and livelihoods in agro-biodiversity hotspots ;;"India is home to incredible diversity in plant and animal species and is ranked among the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. Unfortunately, much of this diversity is being eroded at an alarming rate, largely due to habitat destruction and invasion by alien species. In the hilly regions of southern India, known
as the Eastern and Western Ghats, the native agro-biodiversity (which includes farmed species) is being replaced by the cultivation of cash crops in order to generate farming income. In Kolli Hills (Tamil Nadu), over the last three decades, cassava has increasingly replaced native millets. A parallel shift has happened in Jeypore (Odisha), where eucalyptus is now occupying traditional agricultural landscapes, while banana is replacing paddy rice in Wayanad (Kerala). Roots and tubers, often neglected by agricultural extension systems, are traditional sources of food and income for small farmers in rural India.

While enabling farmers to generate some income, the loss of diversity and increasing monoculture of market-driven cash crops is accelerating rates of soil erosion, promoting crop disease, while making farmers more vulnerable to climate risks. It is also reducing local food production, thereby increasing people’s dependence on food procured from outside the region, and on wheat and rice provided by public food distribution systems.

This paper is a result of a participatory research and intercropping trials with pulses and millets conducted on farmers by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) in collaboration with the University of Alberta - working through the Alleviating Poverty and Malnutrition in Agrobiodiversity Hotspots (APM) project - initiated participatory varietal selection (PVS) for cassava varieties. The paper also highlights the result of an organized high quality millet seed production through community seed banks.

Participatory research on cassava and elephant foot yam undertaken in Kolli Hills and Wayanad has resulted in farmers identifying better varieties that suit their requirements, including higher yields, higher starch content, enhanced drought tolerance and the ability to adapt to local conditions. Through intercropping, they have also been able to cultivate a diversity of short duration food crops alongside their main crop, boosting the nutritional content of household diets, earning extra income and strengthening the resilience of their farming systems against shocks, such as drought.

eldis:A63550;Conflict resolution among pastoral communities in West Pokot County, Kenya: a missing link;;"Conflicts over control of and access to natural resources are common among pastoral communities living in arid and semi-arid environments of Kenya. This study investigates conflicts and conflict resolution strategies in West Pokot County, Kenya. The objectives were to: identify the sources of conflict; examine conflict resolution initiatives; and evaluate the effectiveness of peacebuilding initiatives. The study found that peacebuilding initiatives were able to decrease incidences of historical conflict between pastoral communities and the Pokots (living in West Pokot County), but they did not decrease conflicts associated with natural resources, especially those related to scarcity of pasture and water. The study highlights that climate change mitigation was absent in all peacebuilding initiatives in the county and recommends that mitigation efforts should be the focal point in addressing conflicts in pastoral regions since climate change is causing the decline of natural resources.

eldis:A70533;Market challenges for the restoration of the environment ;;"Over the past century South Africa has become increasingly reliant on the manufacturing and services industries for its economic development and growth. However, the natural environment continues to play an important role in the livelihoods of particularly the poor, those in rural areas and the agriculture sector – the latter being essential for urban living.

Restoration of the natural environment involves the replenishment of the natural environment through both active and passive means. Passive restoration undertakes the removal of those things that damage the environment such as invasive alien plants.

Active restoration, on the other hand, involves active intervention such as the control of alien invasive plant species and the re-establishing of natural (indigenous) vegetation, for example by re-seeding, re-planting and soil preparation treatments.

This poliy brief looks at key aspects of restoration:


	
	location: the selection of the restoration site is crucial, as this affects the supply of environmental goods and services to the market. Features to consider include the extent of degradation, distance from the market, the exist ence of an appropriate distribution channel, and the nature of the land tenure. Other f actors include the climatic conditions, and also the vegetation type, as this will affect the range of environmental goods and services supplied. There is a need to start in areas where there is a greater chance of success
	
	
	functionality: restoration has the aim of restoring the functionality of an ecosystem. This in turn affects the flow of goods and services onto the market. However, this can only happen if markets themselves are well functioning, where possible free from restrictions and characterised by many buyers and sellers. Where markets are not well functioning, some monitoring is required to ensure that dominant players do not manipulate the system to the detriment of other participants
	
	
	process: many environmental commodities are traded as free goods, or at a price that does not reflect their true value. One example in South Africa is water. A key market challenge for restoration is to determine an appropriate price for environmental goods and services. A number of techniques are available in order to achieve this

eldis:A69841;Township renewal: Kwamashu case study;;"The restructuring of local government in South Africa began in the mid-1990s. A number of smaller local councils in the greater Durban area were amalgamated into a single metropolitan municipality, and the boundaries of the city were expanded to incorporate a number of new areas. The department responsible for economic development at the time started to look for a suitable location for a focused, municipality-led intervention in the newly incorporated areas. The political violence of the 1980s had been particularly intense in the northern areas. As a result, development in those areas had been impeded, and there was a greater level of need.

This study looks at the township renewal project in Kwamashu townships and makes recommendations for efficiency. The KwaMashu Town Centre (KMTC) project began in 1999. The centre faced a number of problems, some of them interrelated:

• The town centre planned for KwaMashu from the mid-1950s had never developed.

• There was a lack of investment, both public and private.

• Residents had to travel long distances to access facilities, goods and services.

• Public transport infrastructure was poorly developed.

• There was a lack of security, social infrastructure and recreation facilities.

The study observes that in 1998, a pre-planning assessment concluded that the greatest positive economic impact could be achieved by focusing on the development of one centre in the newly incorporated northern areas – namely the KwaMashu Town Centre. Key reasons included:

• It was already a busy transportation hub for train, bus and taxi commuters. This meant there were already large numbers of people in a highly accessible location.

• It had a large area of well-located, undeveloped land owned by the state that had been set aside for a town centre. This land had potential for future.

The paper identifies some of the achievements of the projects as upgrading of infrastructure and engineering services, planning framework and zoning and regulatory frameworks, upgrade of a number of the important road links to other economic centres and links to existing railway stations, 6ha of prime housing land ready to be sold and developed, a Metro Police station, high-grade shopping centre and others while uncertain about the mixed-use development model, long-term sustainability amongst others.

The paper concludes by stating some of the lessons learnt from the project.

eldis:A101909;Policies for improved food security: The roles of land tenure policies and land markets;;This paper provides an overview of what we know about farm size distributions, the emerging land markets, the role of tenure systems, tenure reforms and land policies in shaping the distribution of increasingly scarce land resources. The primary focus is on Africa while making some comparisons with Asia. Climate risk and change have serious implications for household vulnerability and food security. While there is a need to absorb further population growth in rural areas, a rapid rise in rural-urban migration is inevitable. Careful land use planning and tenure reforms are needed to smooth the transition towards more intensive land use. ;S.T.

eldis:A71451;A comparative study on cotton production in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan;;"Center for Development Research (ZEF) report to evaluate the cotton production sectors in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and to develop potential avenues for improvement.

In this report a broad comparison of the cotton growing sectors in these two Central Asian republics is presented, followed by specific recommendations for the cotton sectors of both countries that cater to their respective challenges. The broad conclusion that can be drawn here is that Uzbek farmers and stakeholders can learn much from the Kazakh experience. In terms of natural and historical conditions for cotton growing, there are many similarities between the two states. However, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the two countries have followed different trajectories with respect to market reforms, with high levels of government control over the cotton sector prevailing in Uzbekistan while Kazakhstan experienced a gradual relaxation of government control (Baffes 2007; Shtaltovna 2012).

Comparing these divergent experiences, the following recommendations for improving the performance of the cotton sector in both countries emerge from the analysis:


	professionalisation of farmers should be encouraged;
	farmers associations that represent farmers’ interests should replace state organisations;
	communication between farmers and the state should be improved; cotton monocultures should gradually be transitioned to diversified cropping systems;
	and on-site capacity for cotton processing should be supported.

eldis:A12664;Land in Africa: an indispenable element towards increasing the wealth of the poor;;The poor in Mozambique survive off the land, but what would the consequences be if the land was privatised? This paper looks at how Mozambique is approaching issues surrounding land usage and ownership as market reforms take place and the land becomes increasingly susceptible to being opened up to the market.A historical background to the issue of land use and ownership in Africa is given, from colonisation to the impact of globalisation and the market in present day Africa. The author suggests that:where the neo-liberal model of land reform took place, rather than land being used for productive ends, monopolisation and land speculation occuredthere were those among the poor who reverted to the condition of being ‘landless’, having to resort to leasing the land urban dwelling large landowners who invested nothing towards the improvement of the lands under their controlcredit did not flow as had been foreseen, because the commercial banks did not accept the land of the poor as collateralthe state’s compensation system for redistribution of land at the market price of the land ended up as a big problem for governments genuinely concerned with the welfare of the poorThe author concludes that:land needs public and private investment and, under current conditions, it cannot be transformed into goods that can be perfectly converted into capitalaccess to land must be guaranteed to all persons who wish to worksecurity of land tenure begins by recognising occupation rights and may be terminated by private appropriation with social limitations by the consubstantiated in the state’s institutionsland may and must be used as the poor people’s capitalthe persuasion mechanisms of the local institutions must be institutionalised into the administration of the physical spaceThe paper concludes by describing the Land Campaign that led to the building of an institutional framework encapsulated in the Mozambique Land Law of 1997 ;J.

It introduced too many alien concepts simultaneously, took insufficient cognisance of traditional attitudes to cattle ownership, and did not secure active participation by the members.group action to overcome a problem perceived by outsiders can only be expected if that problem is also recognised and considered important by the community.Ideas may be introduced but the actual initiative for change should come from the people.the issues of grazing control and stock limitation can probably be successfully tackled only when the problems more readily perceived by the communities have been addressed and overcomeboundary recognition is an essential pre-requisite to voluntary stock control, and is more easily established for cohesive groups ;R.

However, strategic planning and development programming tend to focus on individual sectors such as the environment, agriculture, and population; they do not explicitly take into account the compatibilities and inconsistencies among them. Farm households and their livelihood strategies are at the core of the intersectoral linkages approach advocated in this chapter. Three key aspects of the population-environment-development debate are discussed: first, the finding that inconsistencies between public and individual household behavior regarding childbearing and family planning constitute a veritable ""demographic tragedy of the commons;"" second, the tendency to conceptualize population variables as ""unmanageable,"" and exogenous to environmental and economic change; third, the importance of land markets and land tenure as critical population-sustainability policy issues.

eldis:A69769;Urban Land Markets in East Africa;;"The cities in the East African region are characterised by rapid urbanisation and uncontrolled spatial sprawl, with large informal settlements and inadequate service provision. The research study investigates how urban land markets operate in such a context, and particularly, how effectively poor people can access, trade and hold land.

Whilst each country has its own characteristics, laws and regulations that influence land transactions, some common features were identified. The examples chosen for this case study illustrate this variety as well as some of the elements and challenges that are common to urban land markets in this region.

Urban land markets may be considered to work well if, for example, people are able to access adequate shelter with basic services, in suitable locations with reasonable security of tenure. In view of this, the following recommendations are offered:

• Plan with a vision – to create better living environments for all citizens with efficient and affordable basic services, more compact city structures to reduce residents’ travel times and costs, and to reduce urban areas encroaching on peri-urban land with high agricultural potential that could be better used to grow food for city dwellers.

• Address the needs of the poor, particularly regarding infrastructure, shelter and service delivery.

• Identify ways to integrate newcomers to the city into the formal land delivery system, for example make it easier and less expensive for land to be sub-divided into smaller plots, particularly in rapidly growing peri-urban areas.

• Develop the capacity of public authorities to plan, allocate, administer and manage land efficiently and effectively.

• Develop land information systems to inform land-use planning and urban land markets and guard against well-connected individuals abusing the system to the disadvantage of the urban majority.

• Recognise that customary or informal systems are not merely ‘survival’ tenure systems. Both systems have their advantages and shortcomings.

• Take account of the local or national context when considering whether it is desirable or feasible to phase out a customary system over time. Where both systems are maintained, clarify the interface between them and make it workable.

• Nurture and accommodate innovative land allocation approaches to enhance land accessibility for all urban citizens.

eldis:A16522;At the crossroads: participatory forest management in Karnataka;;"This article attempts to assess whether the promises of the Joint Forest Planning and Management (JFPM) programme initiated in the Indian state of Karnataka in 1993 have materialised in terms of villagers managing their common lands sustainably, equitably and autonomously.  It draws on findings from a 2003 study of JFPM in the eastern plains region; earlier studies for the Western Ghats region; and information gathered from regional consultations with representatives of village forest committees (VFCs) and the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) in late 2001.The article identifies a number of problems with the implementation of the JFPM programme, including: it was limited to “degraded” areas (lands with less than 25 per cent canopy cover) so that denser forested areas were not brought under management the emphasis on planting up these lands often caused hardship to villagers who had been using them as grazing lands auctioning of valuable non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to outside contractors failed to benefit villagers or to enhance ecological sustainability of NTFP extraction VFCs were formed through top-down processes and lacked autonomy in many cases, plantations were made first and VFCs formed afterwards, rendering the joint planning rhetoric meaningless even where VFC formation preceded plantation activity, there was no serious process of participatory planning inadequate attention to community mobilisation and awareness building meant that VFCs could not generally free themselves from economic, caste and gender inequalities within villages in some cases JFPM has become a tool for completely shutting out subsistence use of the forest (rather than regulating it) in favour of growing cash crops JFPM is not seen by forestry officials as a core process for project implementation, but as a parallel activity; the role of the local community is seen as only co-operating in the protection of the plantations, not in determining the overall strategy for common land regeneration and use.The article concludes with recommendations for future joint management programmes:a more sophisticated concept of joint management should be developed, recognising the highly differentiated nature of rural society in Karnataka and involving all stakeholders in decision-making  rather than attempting to change the whole state at once, participatory management could be implemented first in villages or areas with favourable characteristics, such as high forest dependence, relatively homogenous communities, and an absence of older systems of individual rights strong grassroots support is needed for JFPM to be implemented effectively.

eldis:A25134;Understanding and promoting range management by herders in Eastern Turkey;;This paper describes the pastoral situation in Erzurum Province,  Anatolia, Turkey, and gives an account of some of the existing range management practices.It emphasises the necessity of understanding existing pastoral practices, and more importantly the circumstances that give rise to them, when planning the improvement of livestock husbandry, breeding, fodder production and pasture management. Erzurum province is one of the most important areas in Turkey for the production of sheep and cattle for fattening and slaughter. Not only is it important as a source of red meat and store animals for the domestic market, but also for export to Turkey's eastern neighbours. In addition the herds of cattle and more especially the flocks of sheep, produce dairy products, mainly cheese as well as carpet wool. Livestock husbandry practices are still based almost exclusively on the seasonal use of rangelands, alpine pastures and hay meadows supplemented wherever possible by planted fodder and fodder grain crops: irrigated lucerne, dry land sainfoin and vetches, barley and rye. This feed base is however recognised as being inadequate for the numbers of stock involved, especially through the long harsh east Anatolian winter, when the resident village flocks and herds are housed in dark and primitive stables. Much of the range-land is degraded, overstocked and over-grazed. Furthermore much of the hay crop is sold out of the Province for cash, leaving many of the resident herds and flocks to survive the winter on a diet based largely on chopped straw. ;A.

eldis:A29511;Displaced communities and the reconstruction of livelihoods in Eritrea;;Paper focuses on the resettlement of people displaced by Eritrea's 30 year liberation war. However, Eritrea's 1998-2000 war with Ethiopia poses new reconstruction problems which are only now emerging. Since large-scale programmes of post-war resettlement and reintegration are costly, it is important to learn the lessons of the previous resettlement programme started after the end of the liberation war in 1991.Paper shows that land tenure largely facilitated resettlement (although long-term environmental problems may emerge), social capital built during the war has been a positive resource, and the state's legitimacy has been another positive factor despite the shortage of skills, and fragmented help from donors.Conclusions and policy implications:those who self-settled generally did better that those who settled under government schemes: the implies that helping self-settlement is more cost-effective than direct government helpthe success of returnees in reconstructing their livelihoods depends upon the resumption of sustainable development activities in settlement areas, therefore a multifaceted development programme should be implemented in the areas of return. This does, however, require more donor support given the limited resources of Eritreaassistance is most effective and equitable when provided on a community-wide basis, bringing benefits to the entire population of areas where returnees settle. Again, further donor resources are needed to reinforce government efforts[Adapted from the author] ;G.

eldis:A100153;Land, biodiversity and extractive industries in southern Africa: How effective are legal and institutional frameworks in protecting people and the environment?;;In the natural resources sector, laws are often formulated to regulate the relationship between men and the environment. Ideally, the law can play a vital role in regulating and protecting communities from adverse environmental and social impacts of mining, loss of land, biodiversity and natural wealth, as well as other human rights violations. Almost all countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have developed laws and institutions to regulate and monitor the extraction of mineral resources and their impact on the environment and people. However, the level of implementation and enforcement of those laws varies across the region and in some cases legal gaps exist.In light of this, the Southern Africa Resource Watch (SARW) commissioned research in three SADC countries – Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe – to assess the effectiveness of exiting legal and institutional frameworks governing land, social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector. This policy brief analyses the findings of the three reports and identifies current legal and institutional frameworks in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana that seek to protect land, biodiversity and communities from the adverse impacts of mining. It highlights good practices while also capturing crosscutting weaknesses and gaps in the legal frameworks. The policy brief also analyses the institutional capacities of responsible government departments, whose legal mandate is to monitor and hold mining companies accountable, and looks at the domestication and application of regional and international instruments. More importantly, the efficacy of voluntary practices and standards adopted by mining companies and financial institutions to promote social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector is also assessed. ;;;Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa;eldis;01/01/2016;en;"environment;land;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"ZAF;BWA;ZWE";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A100153;http://www.osisa.org/sites/default/files/land_biodiversity_and_extractive_industries_in_southern_africa_1_0.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.osisa.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fland_biodiversity_and_extractive_industries_in_southern_africa_1_0.pdf;;;;"Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa;Environment;Corporate Social Responsibility;Conflict and security;Land issues;Good Governance;Governance;Agriculture and food;natural resources as driver of conflict;Extractive industries;Drivers of conflict;Environment and natural resource management"

eldis:A26335;Land management in Ghana: building on tradition and modernity;;An overlap in the regulation of access to land and resources between customary and state management systems is causing problems of contradiction and conflict. This report analyses the pros and cons of both systems and makes a series of recommendations.State administration of land is found to have worked against poorer elements in Ghana. Whilst the Lands Commission and other institutions have made some positive achievements there is no evidence of practical benefits for the majority. Compulsory acquisition has resulted in displacement, landlessness and social unrest. Lack of resources, low morale, corruption and lack of co-ordination are widespread and opportunities to reform state land management have so far been missed however the Governments recent National Land Policy report is a step forward.Customary management systems in contrast are dynamic and evolutionary. They are still strong throughout Ghana particularly in the North in spite of state laws however they are under extreme pressure in some areas from high population growth and rapid urbanisation. In these areas the weakening of customary structures have resulted in endemic poverty, landlessness, homelessness and general insecurity. There is no equity, transparency or accountability in the management of land sales, which often results in conflict and uncertainty.The report stresses the importance of donor and government support for land reforms and recommends:Land policy reform based on social and natural justice, law, equity and efficiencyThe Lands Commission other government service agencies should be split into independent self financing agenciesConstitutional provisions regarding land tenure and administration need to be adhered toConstitutional amendments with respect to land management and collection and utilisation of revenues are required within the framework of existing tax laws ;"K.

eldis:A18602;Lessons from the land reform movement in West Bengal, India;;"The Indian state of West-Bengal saw two major turnarounds in its rural sector in the eighties. The growth rate of rice production jumped from 1.8 per cent during 1960-80 to 4.7 per cent during 1977-94, and rural poverty fell from 73 to 31 per cent between 1973 and 1999, greatly surpassing achievements of other Indian states.This coincided with the 1977 election of a coalition of left-wing parties, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM, which held uninterrupted power for the following 26 years. The CPM instituted a series of major rural reforms guaranteeing heritable rights to sharecropping tenants; ensured better distribution of products between tenants and owners; and confiscated surplus landholdings from big land owners and distributed part of this to poor farmers. This was followed in 1985 by decentralisation of village power structures through a three-tier system known as panchayati raj.This paper attempts to identify which factors were behind West Bengal’s rural success, using cross-section time-series pooled regressions on district-level data.Its results suggest that:the reforms guaranteeing heritable rights to sharecropping tenants had some effect in raising productivity of yield and led to increases in the use of irrigation, fertiliser, rural roads and labourit appears to be economically optimal to accord heritable rights to 25 per cent of sharecropping households in a district: extending coverage beyond this level tended to mean that too many of the households included in the programme were too poor to afford other, complementary production inputsthe panchayat system created the right incentive and power structure to increase investment in land through better irrigation, rural roads, seeds, and higher labour use; this helped to improve yields by spreading the availability of these inputspanchayats also played an effective role in mediating water disputes and ensuring a steady labour supply and minimum wagesweaknesses of the reforms included the neglect of wage demands of poor people other than sharecroppers, particularly agricultural labourers, and a lack of attention to gender inequalitythe reforms also failed to ensure the state’s economy diversified into new crops and non-agricultural rural industries.The paper concludes that the success of the West Bengal model depended on a number of historical and political factors specific to the state. However, it argues that at least some parts could usefully be emulated elsewhere, especially strengthening of the grass roots decision making process. ";A.

eldis:A72483;Integrating urban agriculture and forestry into climate change action plans: Lessons from Western Province, Sri Lanka and Rosario, Argentina ;;"For cities to be sustainable, they need to simultaneously address the vulnerability of people, places and sectors that may be affected by a changing climate; mitigate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and ensure adequate access to basic urban services such as water, food and energy to their growing populations. 

There is growing recognition of urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry as an important strategy for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Experiences in Sri Lanka and Argentina have shown that urban agriculture can help reduce the vulnerability of the urban poor and address climate change at the same time. The experiences in Sri Lanka and Argentina provide a first set of monitoring data and have informed the development of an appropriate and applicable monitoring framework. The authors discuss that the local application of this methodology elsewhere could be effectively used to: 


	develop GHG emission reduction plans, taking into account urban agriculture alongside other interventions; 
	develop local food system strategies; 
	integrate agriculture in urban planning as an appropriate use for vulnerable sites and a viable response to climate change effects; 
	enhance awareness among citizens, the private sector and policy-makers on urban agriculture and climate change; and 
	obtain national and international support and funding for adaptation measures involving urban and peri-urban agriculture.

eldis:A71510;What drives the global land rush?;;"Recent increases in the level of agricultural commodity prices and the resulting demand for land has been accompanied by a rising interest in acquiring agricultural land by investors. This paper studies the determinants of foreign land acquisition for large-scale agriculture.

The paper estimates gravity models using data on bilateral investment relationships, together with newly constructed indicators of agro-ecological suitability in areas with low population density as well as land rights security. Consequently, the results confirm the central role of agro-ecological potential as a pull factor.

Nevertheless, the results suggest that, in contrast to what is found for foreign investment more generally, rule of law and good governance have no effect on the number of land-related investment. Moreover, and counterintuitively, the document finds that countries where governance of the land sector and tenure security are weak have been most attractive for investors.

Based on the findings, the author concludes that, to minimise the risk that such investments fail to produce benefits for local populations, the micro-level and project-based approach that has dominated the global debate so far will need to be complemented with an adequate policy. This policy will need to emphasis and determine actions to improve land governance, transparency and global monitoring.

eldis:A25298;The Emerging Legal Framework for Private Sector Development in Viet Nam's Transitional Economy;;"Private (especially foreign) investors find Viet Nam's legal framework the most serious impediment to investment. Policy changes to reverse the former command system may be enough to initiate the transition. But without an appropriate legal framework, they will be insufficient for long-term development.A major objective of Viet Nam's transition to a market economy has been to reactivate the private sector in a mixed economy. Several new laws have been introduced in the past five years to implement this policy and to create an enabling environment for the private sector.Thuyet reviews some of the more important laws and regulations that affect Viet Nam's private sector activities, including laws on real property, intellectual property, companies, domestic investment, foreign investment, bankruptcy, contracts, and dispute resolution. Antimonopoly law has not yet been introduced in Viet Nam. The issue of competition is addressed in the context of trade law, the relative roles of the state and private sector, and restrictions in company law. These areas all establish the foundation of a legal framework for a market economy. Among Thuyet's conclusions:Viet Nam's legal framework, like China's, is still influenced by ideology, which causes problems in such areas as private ownership of real property and with such fundamental legal concepts as ""due process of law."" The private sector is constrained by the lack of an independent judiciary, the absence of private land ownership, other uncertainties in property law that limit the development of financial markets, and the inherent bias of the system in favor of the state sector (and collective ownership). A lawabiding attitude, equally important to development, has been slow to develop. Viet Nam's foreign investment process is too complicated, and its company law too restrictive. A first priority should be to streamline regulations.Viet Nam has been slow to privatize its state enterprises, another step essential for development. Trade policy also needs to be liberalized.Export processing zones may be a useful interim instrument to attract foreign investment but should be phased out over time. More important in the long term is a good investment climate resting on a strong legal foundation.This paper a product of the Transition Economics Division, Policy Research Department is part of a larger effort in the department to understand the legal and institutional requirements for transition from socialism to a market economy.

eldis:A73007;Implications of land use change in tropical Northern Africa under global warming;;"This discussion paper asses possible feedbacks between the type of land use and harvest intensity and climate.

It highlights that a major link between climate and humans in Northern Africa, and the Sahel in particular, is land use and associated land cover change, mainly where subsistence farming prevails. The results of the study are taken to suggest marginal feedback between land use changes and climate changes triggered by strong greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that climate change can be considered as external driver in models of land-use – conflict dynamics when seasonal or mean values are used as external driver.

eldis:A60648;Adapting to climate change in the water sector;;"This background note, published by the Overseas Development Institute, provides an overview of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that face the water sector due to climate change. It also summarises of some of the adaptive strategies, targeting both supply and demand of water, being employed across various sectors in the developing world and offers suggestions going forward. It concludes by assessing how current knowledge of climate change can help inform future planning of water sector interventions. Acknowledging the inherent difficulties of predicting complex systems, the document divides the impacts of climate change on the water sector into knowns and unknowns. On the supply side, it is generally accepted that precipitation will increase at higher latitudes and in the tropics, but decrease in the sub-tropics. Growing evidence shows decreased snow cover in many regions as well as valuable glacial resources (with a projected loss of 60 per cent by 2050). The result is changes in flood and drought patterns putting many more people at risk. Urbanisation, rising populations, rising sea level, bio-fuel production and agriculture are all expected to greatly increase demand for water. These are all trends however; other factors are much more difficult to predict, namely socio-political events, markets and local-scale climate modelling. Four broad options are outlined for adaptive approaches.

    Hazards-based approach – reduces risks and uses climate scenarios to assess future vulnerabilities.
    Vulnerability-based approach – aims to ensure a minimum threshold of vulnerability is not exceeded. 
    Adaptive-capacity approach – assesses and improves adaptive capacity to better cope with variability.
    Policy-based approach – aims for robust climate change policies, through mainstreaming and climate proofing. 

Several examples of different water sector interventions found in the National Adaptation Programmes of Actions by LDCs and it is noted that the vast majority are supply-side interventions, with only a few examples (including Eritrea and Lesotho) aiming to put in place supply and demand side legislation. Limitations are highlighted in recognition that issues of social and political access are rarely addressed. It is suggested that adaptation policies should be responsive to socio-economic and political contexts, and provide suitable options for different scales of farm. It is also suggested that integrated management, as encapsulated by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), can with enough financing and institutionalisation (something that has proven difficult) help with decision-making. Focus should be on the development of better planning and more comprehensive resource and drought mapping. ";"A. Nicol

eldis:A69806;The impact of large scale land acquisitions on water resources – a background note;;"Since 2008 there has been a rapid increase in the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in agricultural land in Sub Saharan Africa and South East Asia. In 2008-2009 land acquisitions were estimated to be approximately 56 million hectares, 70-75% of which were in Africa (although it is likely that many leases are still pending or not yet executed). Large scale land acquisitions are primarily for agricultural development (circa 80%). The remaining 20% are dominated by extractives and infrastructure. Both agricultural development and extractives are potentially water intensive and water-polluting but high-quality research and understanding of these impacts is limited.

Analysis of the location of land acquisitions for the purposes of agricultural development and the types of crops that are grown strongly suggest that access to water is a primary rationale for acquiring land. The land is predominantly located close to access to blue water resources, which suggests an intention to irrigate the land. The UK, the US and China have acquired the most land but the picture in terms of water resources is different, with the US, the United Arab Emirates and India having acquired the most. However, data on the amount of water appropriated under land deals is highly uncertain and disputed more than data on the area of land acquired.

Despite this evidence, consideration of water in current debates on the impact of foreign investment in agricultural land has been peripheral and international guidelines and principles that seek to prevent damaging land acquisitions have not, until very recently, dealt with the risks land acquisitions pose to existing water resources and the risk water resources (or their scarcity) poses to successful investments in land.

eldis:A35697;Rural land certification in Ethiopia: process, initial impact, and implications for other African countries;;"Although many African countries have adopted highly innovative and pro-poor land laws, lack of implementation hinders their potentially far-reaching impact on productivity, poverty reduction, and governance. To assess the effects of these pro-poor land laws and analyse whether the existing doubts are justified, this report draws on the experience of Ethiopia which, over a period of 2-3 years, registered the majority of rural lands in a rapid process at rather low cost. This report discusses the challenges for land policy and administration in Africa together with recent initiatives to reform legal frameworks and establish accessible institutions in response to these. Against this background, it describes key characteristics of Ethiopia’s land policy and its recent certification process. The report then uses village- and household-level data to describe the extent to which different stages of certification were implemented as planned and to explore the extent to which these varied along lines of gender or wealth. The report also provides evidence on impact as well as costs of first-time registration as carried out now and with a spatial reference added and discusses options to ensure that the information generated is kept up to date and can sustain itself based on user fees. Lastly the report presents conclusions and policy implications, which are targeted at individuals interested in replicating or improving these land reforms in other African contexts: 

    the rapid speed, participatory nature, and low cost of Ethiopia’s land certification, together with the positive results from this process and the absence of bias in favor of the wealthy or lack of access to information by the poor, demonstrate that large-scale and rapid delivery of land certificates in a participatory way is possible 
    users’ positive assessment of the process, readiness to pay to replace lost certificates, high demand - and willingness to pay - for a spatial reference, and their positive assessment of likely impacts suggest that the way in which Ethiopia implemented land certification responded to local needs 
    the fact that most disputes were resolved in the field, reinforced by initial evidence of positive investment- and transfer-effects, suggests that elements of Ethiopia’s certification process, with modifications as needed, could serve as a model for other African countries to quickly scale up implementation of land legislation, the innovative provisions of which have thus far been largely ineffective.

eldis:A25290;Promoting economic growth in Sri Lanka: lessons from East Asia;;"Why, despite solid progress in human development and in the reduction of consumption poverty, has Sri Lanka's per capita income fallen far behind the dynamic East Asian economies? Sri Lanka's weaker growth performance was the result of several factors, including Sri Lanka's lower investment and (especially) domestic savings rates, its lower average productivity of investment (return on capital), its weak agricultural performance, and its poor export growth.Sri Lanka's weak economic performance, although compounded by the civil war and budgetary imbalance, largely reflects:A stop and go pattern of policy reform, because of political constraints even though the results of reform were generally positive. Weak economic management, resulting in high inflation and a high fiscal and balance of payments deficit. Poor management of public spending. Mixed performance in exchangerate management, with periods of substantial overvaluation. Financial policies that (despite recent improvements) hamper efficient financial intermediation. Prolonged trade protection, followed by selective trade liberalization. Continued distortion in agricultural policies. Inflexible labor markets and, despite Sri Lanka's outstanding track record on human development, problems with the quality of the labor force.To address a substantially unfinished policy agenda, Sri Lanka needs to:Intensify efforts to peacefully resolve civil conflict. Squarely address its macroeconomic imbalances: (1) sharply reduce the fiscal deficit; (2) cut back on public spending (including defense spending, with peace) and redefine spending priorities; (3) improve cost recovery for public services; and (4) continue improving the management of the exchange rate. In trade policy, eliminate most quantitative restrictions, further reduce tariff protection, simplify the tariff structure, and, possibly, reform customs (to reduce leakage and abuse). Rationalize employment, exit, and bankruptcy regulations and procedures. Improve communications between government and the private sector. Make the financial sector more competitive by legislating banking reform, giving state owned banks more autonomy and putting private commercial banks on an equal footing with the two state banks, with the ultimate goal of privatizing the state banks. Strengthen the supervision of banking.  Privatize insurance and pension funds to strengthen the capital market. In the agriculture sector: (1) privatize the estate plantations, perhaps through long-term management contracts and the gradual sale of shares in assets, (2) reduce trade protection (especially on rice, wheat, potatoes, chillies, and onions), (3) implement land reform, (4) strengthen agricultural support (for example, irrigation, research and extension, and rural infrastructure), and (5) possibly support rural financing institutions. End government controls on hiring, firing, and wage setting, and rationalize (depoliticize) civil service employment decisions. Make the changes in education needed to improve the quality of the labor force (for example, improve teacher training, courses in science and English as a second language courses, and skills training).This paper a product of the Office of the Director, South Asia Country Department is part of a larger effort in the region to help identify policies for supporting higher growth in Sri Lanka.

eldis:A73323;Grassroots facilitators as agents of change for promoting sustainable forest management: Lessons learned from REDD+ capacity development in Asia;;"This article explores the issues and concerns of grassroots stakeholders with regards to REDD+ policy and program development.

The lessons shared here are generated from REDD+ capacity development at grassroots level in South and Southeast Asia. Keeping in mind that the climate change and REDD+ are continuously evolving topics, the paper argues that sustained capacity development is needed alongside building skills to effectively communicate aspirations and concerns of grassroots communities to policymakers and thus help bridging a gap between them. At a macro level unclear land tenure, poor governance and conflicting land policies continue to pose challenges for designing and implementation of REDD+ and sharing potential benefits from it. To address some of these challenges, the paper argues that multi-pronged and multiscale sustained interventions are needed, supported by building partnerships, collaborations and synergies among stakeholders. Such a coordinated effort will ultimately contribute to future global climate regime and help in poverty reduction among forest dependent communities.

eldis:A73289;Land grabbing under the Cover of Law: Are BRICS-South relationships any different?;;"There is a general consensus among academics, politicians and social movements, that BRICS as ‘new donors’ are increasing both their quantitative and qualitative role in defining what is considered to be ‘the world economic order’.

In particular, several authors have underlined the importance of BRICS as a challenge to the traditional development paradigm, describing the five countries as proponents of a South-South cooperation which weakens the so-called Washington Consensus because it does not attach policy conditionalities, provides assistance based on a win-win paradigm, and places emphasis on how to ensure economic sustainability of the recipient country.

Moreover, such rhetoric is not only produced by academics or international financial institutions, but fostered and reinforced by BRICS themselves. For example, while China especially stresses the need to respect the sovereignty of the receiving country, all the BRICS are trying to create an identity which differs from that of established donors, and claim to promote alternative strategies based on equality, solidarity, mutual development and cooperation.

These differences from traditional Northern donors, it is assumed, contribute to more effective cooperation and to a better reception by local populations.

This chapter does not challenge the idea that some differences exist between the way in which Northern donors and BRICS conceive receiving countries’ sovereignty and their independence where official development assistance (ODA) is at stake. Rather, it focuses on large-scale investments in foreign land (LaSIL) and concludes that, when access to this scarce resource is at stake, the legal mechanisms, rhetorical approaches and geostrategic positions of the BRICS (with the exception of Russia) toward the South replicate the traditional strategy of Northern countries more than the general narrative about emerging donors may suggest.

Leaving aside the political, economic and social importance that the large-scale industrialisation of agriculture plays in transforming each of the BRICS, this chapter focuses exclusively on the ‘global land rush’, that is, the attempt to control and exploit land abroad.

eldis:A69551;Large-Scale Land Acquisition : Field Findings and Recommendations;;"The Chinese central government has consistently taken decisive legal and policy measures over the past 35 years to secure, enhance, and expand farmers’ rights to farmland and forest land in order to reduce the
gap in income and consumption between urban citizens and their counterparts in mountainous forest areas. While encouraging development of a forest land rights market to facilitate market allocation of resources, these legal rules and policy directives have particularly emphasized protecting farmers’ forest land rights and their property interests when such land rights are subject to acquisition by powerful
enterprises.

Among these powerful players in China’s forest land rights markets are multinational forest companies, including Asia Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd (APP). In order to understand how APP carried out land acquisition and to what extent its land acquisition was propelled by local governments, researchers from Landesa, an international land laws and policy
institute, conducted intensive field research using the Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) method in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces in February and September 2013, in collaboration with Rights and Resources
Initiative (RRI).

The report provides a comprehensive review of existing laws, regulations, and central policies on farmers’ land rights and the transfer of these rights. Based on thorough discussions and analysis of the most important issues identified in the fieldwork, a series of recommendations are offered to improve APP’s land acquisition practices.

    at the macro level, the protection of property rights is expected to provide an expectation to investors that they will be able to appropriate returns. This reduction in investors risk creates incentives to invest. Economic growth is driven by the incentives of firms to invest
    at the micro level, more secure property rights, and especially rights to land, are expected to play an important role to improve households’ welfare. Rights to land can provide means to sustain livelihoods and food security through the production and sale of crops. Under certain conditions, rights to land may also provide a buffer for households to smooth consumption, for example through sale or mortgaging of assets

eldis:A19339;The curse of gold;;This report documents human rights abuses linked to efforts to control two key gold mining areas, Mongbwalu (Ituri District) and Durba (Haut Uélé District) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Findings of the report include:competition to control the gold mines and trading routes has spurred the bloody conflict that has gripped this area since the start of the Congolese war in 1998 and continues to the presentafter 2003 two armed groups, one backed by Uganda and the other by  Rwanda, fought for the control of gold-mining areas and trade routeseach group won a gold-rich area but battles in a struggle to control Mongbwalu continued Human Rights Watch researchers documented the slaughter of at least two thousand civilians in the Mongbwalu area alone between June 2002 and September 2004 after peace talks and the installation of a transitional government, multinational corporations nonetheless sought to sign new deals to start gold mining and exploration operations in the rich gold concessions in the northeast AngloGold Ashanti, one of the largest gold producers in the world, established relations with the FNI, one of the armed group responsible for serious human rights abuses including war crimes and crimes against humanity, and who controlled the Mongbwalu area as a company with public commitments to corporate social responsibility, AngloGold Ashanti should have ensured their operations complied with those commitments and did not adversely affect human rights, but this does not seem to have been the case in 2003, an estimated $60 million worth of Congolese gold was exported from Uganda, much of it destined for Switzerland.  One of the companies buying gold from Uganda is Metalor Technologies, a leading Swiss refinery the chain of Congolese middlemen, Ugandan traders, and multinational corporations forms an important funding network for armed groups operating in northeastern Congo the international community has failed to effectively tackle the link between resource exploitation and conflict in the Congo.

eldis:A19337;Bringing equality home: promoting and protecting the inheritance rights of women;;"In this report, the COHRE Women and Housing Rights Programme (WHRP) documents the fact that under both statutory and customary law, the overwhelming majority of women in sub-Saharan Africa (regardless of their marital status) cannot own or inherit land, housing and other property in their own right. Instead, in respect of access to land and housing, women are made entirely dependant on their relationship to a male.The paper reviews the legislation and administrative policies in relation to land, housing and inheritance rights in ten sub-Saharan African countries: Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.This review includes national constitutions, administration of estates acts, marriage and marital property acts, inheritance and succession laws, and land laws and policies. Where applicable case law is also examined. As far as is possible, it also provides an overview of customary law and traditions related to inheritance. The study highlights realities of women’s experience of inheritance rights denial using personal testimony and information from secondary sources. Using international human rights as the standard of measurement, the reports examines the laws and situations within each country and makes specific recommendations to the various country governments.The paper concludes that issues of women’s inheritance extend far beyond the crucial challenge of establishing the necessary legal frameworks that would allow women to own and inherit property. For in almost all ten sub-Saharan countries examined, the fact that women generally cannot rent, lease, own or inherit land and housing is not just the result of gender-biased statutory law; it is also due to discriminatory customary laws and traditions, as well as social norms and attitudes.In all the cases addressed in this report, women’s lack of security in the housing sphere stems from entrenched systems of gender discrimination, whether these systems be legal or normative, or a combination thereof. These discriminatory customary laws, traditions and cultural norms only serve to intensify and make more widespread the housing and inheritance rights abuses that are currently being faced by many millions of women in the region.Key recommendations for addressing the issue of discrimination against women in the housing sphere are outlined in detail in the paper, falling broadly into two categories:administrative and legal reforms:  States should design and revise laws to ensure that women are accorded full and equal rights to adequate housing, and to own land, housing and other property, by means including the upholding and protection of inheritance rights. States should also undertake administrative reforms and other necessary measures to give women the same rights as men to credit, capital and appropriate technologies, as well as access to markets and informationactive engagement for positive change:  States should actively engage in the transformation of customs and traditions that discriminate against women and deny them security of tenure and equal ownership of, access to and control over land, as well as equal rights to adequate housing and to own housing and other property. In addition, States should ensure the right of women to equal treatment in land and agrarian reform, in land-resettlement schemes, and in ownership of property and access to adequate housing. Furthermore, States should take all other measures that are necessary to promote access to land and housing for disadvantaged women, particularly those who are unable to work for whatever reason, who live in poverty and/or who head households on their own ";"B.

eldis:A15058;Deforestation, floods and state reactions in China and Thailand;;What factors motivate developing countries to prevent deforestation, which can cause serious environmental damage, such as flooding?  Do democratic states take action more effectively than authoritarian states?  This paper considers these questions using two case studies: the 1988 floods in Thailand and the 1998 floods in China, both attributed to extensive deforestation.The paper provides an overview of the state regulation of forestry and state responses to deforestation prior to the disasters in the two countries, and compares state reactions following the floods.Prior to the floods, the paper notes that both China and Thailand suffered extensive deforestation.  In both countries, the state responded with weak ‘proactive policies’, which had a limited impact on deforestation such as regulations on logging, establishment of forest reserves, reforestation programs and forests.The reasons for weak proactive policy were similar in both countries.  These include:economic development was given higher priority than environmental conservationinsufficient funds were allocated for monitoring and controlling illegal logginglocal corruption and collusion between officials and logging intereststhe desire of government to avoid unnecessary conflict with ethnic minorities in some forested regions for the sake of political stabilityThe floods in Thailand in 1988 and the floods in China in 1998 caused great damage to the local population and economy.  This led to a much stronger state reaction.  Logging was banned in both countries, leading to a fall in deforestation.Based on these two cases, the paper suggests that:deforestation in developing countries will normally induce weak proactive policies ecological disaster can stimulate strong reactive responses which produce more dramatic results in forest depletionneither democracy nor critical mass media nor activist NGOS are necessary for such a strong state response to occur The paper concludes that in general, both authoritarian and democratic states in developing countries are too committed to short term economic goals to impose more than weak proactive environmentalist policies.  However, environmental disasters, such as floods, by threatening national economic well being, and thereby, regime survival can lead to much stronger state reactions. ;G.

eldis:A74057;Spoils of oil? Assessing and mitigating the risks of corruption in Lebanon’s emerging offshore petroleum sector;;"To be fully prepared for Lebanon’s possible transformation into a major oil and gas producer, the risks of corruption in connection to its nascent petroleum sector need to be better understood and addressed. Given Lebanon’s dismal track record in countering corruption and its chronically gridlocked political process, the risks of corruption in the country’s nascent petroleum sector are significant.
This paper tracks such risks along the value chain of the country’s expected petroleum production and in the context of revenue management and expenditure. It argues that the first steps in petroleum governance have been encouraging but are far from optimal. Sources of concern pertain to the Lebanese Petroleum Administration’s mandate and relative insulation from political interference, sub-optimal transparency in the pre-qualification process, the envisaged non-disclosure of exploration and production agreements, and the questionable assumption that sub-contracting for offshore petroleum activities will be largely self-regulating. In addition, a range of state institutions and agencies that will be crucial to daily petroleum governance are unlikely to cope if not drastically reformed.
Looking further ahead, this paper touches on a number of policy choices that will have to be made if or when Lebanon’s petroleum reserves are confirmed, including the establishment of a national oil company, determining the role and management of a ‘sovereign fund’, and considering more radical proposals for petroleum revenue expenditure and sharing. It concludes by arguing that a lively and informed national debate on the specificities and technicalities of Lebanon’s petroleum sector may help to create the very prerequisites of political change and create more favorable conditions to counter the risks of corruption.

eldis:A75529;Collective land access rights for enhancing smallholder livelihoods;;"Land liberalisation policies and programmes based on giving individual property rights implemented in the last decades have not produced the expected results in improving rural peasant and/or native livelihoods in Andean and African countries. Previous studies have found mixed results, with more recent literature showing that these programmes were ineffective in increasing productivity, input use or access to credit. On the contrary, emerging literature suggests that maintaining collective land access rights may have positive effects on rural livelihoods in particular for indigenous and peasant communities.

The proposed research will investigate the effect of collective land access on smallholder livelihoods, by comparing different sorts of collective land access rights functioning in four territories in Peru and Kenya to see under which conditions they achieve positive performances in improving livelihoods.

eldis:A70388;Better land use, better future for all: partnering with civil society to enhance sustainable land management in Sub-Saharan Africa;;"Land degradation is a serious problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, where up to two-thirds of the productive land area is reported to be degraded to some extent.  Local communities suffer the most from the degradation of their land and they are therefore fundamental to the widespread adoption of sustainable land management (SLM) techniques.

This overview looks at the project Partnering with civil society to enhance sustainable land management in Sub-Saharan Africa which was formulated in response to existing threats to sustainable land management practices, which are complex and require the active engagement of local communities and civil society organisations in crafting practical policy responses at national, regional and international level.

The goal of the project is to enhance the socio-economic development and livelihoods of rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa through better and more sustainable land management. The project will run from 2013-2016 and its key objective is to build the capacity of CSOs so that they can help to empower grassroots communities in the region to participate and influence the implementation of the Ten Year Strategy of the UNCCD, TerrAfrica and other SLM processes, programmes and policies.

Pastoralists in the Horn seem to experience similar, if not identical, processes resulting from land laws promulgated by the governments in the region.Concludes that the future of the pastoralist in the Horn of Africa will depend on which realistic land tenure system the government will chose. In order for pastoral production systems to continue playing an important role in the national economies of the region, they must have the power to influence the system of governance. This is not the case at present. Marginalisation is a common feature of all the pastoral systems in the Horn today. ;"S Shazali

This study argues that against the backdrop of water scarcity and climate change, it is important to examine issues related to wastewater reuse more holistically and to investigate the challenges and opportunities for its safe and efficient reuse. The study attempts to analyse the current status of wastewater generation, its uses and livelihood benefits especially in agriculture, based on national data and case studies from Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kanpur and Kolkata. Specifically, the objective is to provide estimates of wastewater generation and treatment, synthesise existing data on agricultural use of wastewater, and assess the related benefits and economic value, as well as the potentially adverse environmental and human health impacts. ;P.

eldis:A61692;Agriculture and climate change: a scoping report;;"This scoping report provides context and analysis for addressing agriculture in international climate negotiations with the aim of informing climate negotiators and other stakeholders of different options and unpacking issues of interest. It observes that agriculture is characterised by a number of special features that distinguish it from other sectors, like producing food and meeting basic survival needs. Its context and site-specific nature makes uniform strategies and solutions ineffective and, unlike other sectors, it is directly affected by climate change. Therefore, it has adaptation needs, mitigation potential and complex links to food security, trade, land use and forestry policies.The report outlines the following contextual issues that need to be considered.

    Transformation of agriculture to meet growing demand for food provides opportunities to build synergies and manage trade-offs across the multiple objectives of food security, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.
    Agriculture offers a wealth of opportunities to deliver simultaneously on improving agricultural resilience to climate change, increasing food production and lowering emissions.
    From a food accessibility and availability perspective, agricultural trade offers the potential to balance productivity losses and offset shifts in production patterns.
    Early action can build confidence, capacity and knowledge in preparation for agricultural adaptation and mitigation actions and economic development efforts.
    Agriculture is one of the main drivers of deforestation; integrated land use planning, landscape and ecosystem approaches are thus required to consolidate multiple objectives within broader efforts to plan and manage land use.
    Finance, technology and capacity building are essential to motivate larger scale adaptation efforts and emission reductions from the agricultural sector.
    Strengthening existing agricultural monitoring and evaluation systems is essential to implementing effective climate response measures and for performance and benefit measurements. 

The report concludes that climate change adaptation and mitigation in the agricultural sector must be pursued in the context of meeting projected global food production demands. Moreover, early action holds great potential for countries to take positive action, which can inform national and international policy, finance and science. ";"B. Campbell

eldis:A44473;From land grab to win-win. Seizing the opportunities of international investments in agriculture.;;"Foreign acquisitions of farm land in developing countries have become the focus of concern. Many observers consider them a new form of colonialism that threatens food security of the poor. However, investments could be good news if the objectives of land purchasers are reconciled with the investment needs of developing countries. The paper finds that land for agriculture in developing countries has become a target of international investments because of the following:

    international investments into agriculture have increased, but land under foreign control remains a small portion in developing countries
    though investments are mostly private, governments are heavily involved, especially in recipient countries 
    the focus of investments has shifted from cash crops to the production of basic foods.

The paper concludes that the risks attached to international investments have led to calls for a binding code of conduct. While its enforcement is likely to be problematic, it might nevertheless offer a framework to which national regulations could refer, especially if parties realise that compliance with common standards is in their mutual self interest. More importantly the paper concludes that: 

    international investments in agriculture, other than land acquisition, should be evaluated and promoted. To this end, the extent, nature and impact of international investments going to developing countries needs to be better understood and monitored 
    best practices should be catalogued in law and policy to better inform both host and investing countries 
    apart from improving the conditions of land deals, investment partners should also consider looser contractual arrangements. In fact, the purchase and direct use of land resources is only one strategic response to the food security concerns of countries with limited land and water.

eldis:A27092;Carrying capacity, rangeland degradation and livestock development for the communal rangelands of Botswana;;"A useful debate is developing over carrying capacity and the degradation of communal rangelands in sub-Saharan Africa. With a few lonely exceptions, scientists and policy-makers have in the past claimed that degradation is universal and livestock productivity lowered because of overstocking on communal range. This position has been mainly dogmatic. More recent research has not supported dogmatists; hence the debate, which impinges on livestock development policy in Botswana.A new livestock development policy is being promoted by the Government of Botswana (Ministry of Agriculture 1991). This aims to privatise extensive areas of range, fence it and set stocking rate to `carrying capacity'. This policy would, if it meets its aims, affect livelihoods, nutrition and livestock exports as well as ecological systems. Unfortunately it is written in apparent ignorance of the debate, and rests on old dogma. White (1992) challenged the policy on its biological, ecological, social and economic assumptions and effects. de Queiroz while agreeing that the new policy would carry a high social cost, argued that White had ignored the reality of range degradation in Botswana. He also claimed that there was no basis for White's statement that de-stocking would decrease the productivity of rangeland. This interchange is a fruitful development of the debate. Confusion in the debate arises from the role of science in providing evidence and proof, conflicting theories of degradation, differences between definitions of degradation, assumptions about thresholds of degradation, and over the estimation of the impacts of stocking policy.

eldis:A22906;Environmental histories, access to resources and landscape change: an introduction;;This paper outlines a framework for understanding the complexity of land degradation processes, their impacts, and offers insights into their remediation. The authors suggest that possible options for increasing the relevance of environmental policies and projects to problems include: a ‘local political ecology’ based on an agenda set by the local people that includes long-term advocacy workpartnership research, conducted in collaboration with development actors and organisations having the power to effect change and to adopt key recommendationsa selective application of scientific methods, which are widely understood by policy makers, to illustrate the viability of certain threatened livelihood systems or the genesis of particular resource use trendsparticipation in user-led studies that unfold at a slower pace than standard academic development projectsmore advanced research dissemination procedures, allowing potential clashes between academic researchers and development actors in productive ways.In concluding, the authors call for a research framework on land degradation that combines an assessment of resource use and change at various scales. They argue that an analysis of the institutional structure that governs land and related resources should be included into the research framework. The dominant academic ideas on land use should also be included. The authors feel that the dominance of ideas is closely related to the question of who controls the institutions that govern access. The authors appeal for further research on the relationship between institutions, access, ideas, use and environmental conditions over time and space. ;"S. P. J. Batterbury

eldis:A25224;Pakistan's agriculture sector : is 3 to 4 percent annual growth sustainable?;;For 25 years, agricultural growth has been a key source of the growth in Pakistan's GDP, but the momentum may be running out. Key problems include a crisis in irrigation and the government's overextended role in agriculture. An example of inappropriate government intervention is the provision of subsidies that do not help farmers, either because of rent seeking and inefficiency or because the subsidy (for wheat, for example) helps consumers at the expense of producers. Government spending must shift to a new focus --- on public goods and market failures.A key source of the impressive growth in Pakistan's GDP (6 percent annually for two decades) has been the agriculture sector, which grew about 3.6 percent a year for 25 years. Faruqee analyzes whether such a growth rate is sustainable.In different periods, growth has come from different sources: from a seed, fertilizer, and irrigation package in the 1960s, from intensification of water and fertilizer use in the 1970s, and from improvement of crop management and incentives in the 1980s. In the past 10 years, cotton has been a main source of growth.The momentum for growth may be ending. Total cultivable land and irrigation cannot increase significantly. At best, water resources can expand by 10 percent, and only at great cost. And there have been problems with cotton in recent years.Future growth must come mainly from increases in productivity, achieved by allocating resources to crops for which the country has a comparative advantage, improving the technical efficiency of inputs for each major crop, and increasing cropping intensity. But increasing productivity means changing major agricultural systems, policies, and institutions, including:  Poor incentive policies, which have led to inappropriate use of land and hence to problems of soil erosion and land degradation. Poor distribution of land resources and inadequate systems of land tenure. At one extreme are very large estates of absentee landlords, and at the other, very small, ill-equipped peasant farms. Insecurity of tenure creates disincentives for investing in land.  Persistent problems with irrigation, essential on more than three fourths of agricultural land in Pakistan. Weak human resources and infrastructure.  Direct government intervention in agricultural markets, which, although recently diminished, still distorts markets. Subsidized imports of wheat and price controls on cotton exports reflect a persisting bias against cotton and wheat, while sugarcane is heavily protected. The protection of domestic industry distorts sectoral prices. Government policy also distorts the market for such vital inputs as seeds and fertilizer. Serious problems in the credit market exacerbate other problems arising from policy distortions.This paper --- a product of the Agricultural Operations Division, South Asia, Country Department I --- is part of a larger effort in the department to analyze the major issues facing Pakistan's agriculture sector and to suggest a strategy to improve its performance.

eldis:A27764;Ownership and control in Chinese rangeland management since Mao: The case of free riding in Ningxia;;"With the introduction of rural reforms in the early 1980s, China broke with its
                  collectivist past and began the arduous transition from a centrally planned to a free
                  market economy. The People’s Communes – the institutional basis of
                  agriculture under Mao – were disbanded, and communal land was
                  redistributed to users through a family-based ‘Household Contract
                  Responsibility System’ (HCRS), which offered farmers more managerial
                  freedom by linking rewards directly to production and efficiency.

                  The first period of agricultural reform was largely successful, with grain production
                  increasing enormously and a bumper harvest of over 400 million tons being achieved
                  in 1984. This success legitimised a move towards the further fragmentation and
                  individualisation of agriculture – including the forestry and livestock sectors.
                  The HCRS model was subsequently extended to grazing areas and in 1985 a new
                  Rangeland Law was promulgated, under which rangeland could be contracted to
                  collectives or individuals.

                  The success of previous agricultural reforms was not, however, mirrored in the
                  livestock sector. Today, the Rangeland Law is unenforceable in many parts of China,
                  while the contract system for grasslands has failed miserably. Far from promoting the
                  sustainable use of the rangelands, the new system has tended to enhance pasture
                  degradation, with economic freedom acting as a stimulus for individuals to increase
                  production, whatever the long term implications for the range. The situation as it
                  stands raises a number of questions about the implementation and consequences of
                  the HCRS and Rangeland Law in the livestock sector. In particular it raises doubts
                  about the wisdom of extending policy measures designed for crop agriculture to the
                  livestock sector, without taking into account the inherent differences between
                  production systems.

                  This analysis suggests that the principal underlying cause of the current alleged
                  ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ situation in Ningxia is the establishment of
                  collectivist institutions which undermined the legitimacy of customary rights
                  structures over the regulation of grasslands. Communes failed to create the
                  necessary socio-economic and regulatory conditions that allowed individuals to
                  pursue their own well-being without harming the prospects of future generations.
                  Instead, the pattern of resource use that developed bore all the characteristics of an
                  open-access system, under which resources were squandered. The present
                  government’s attempt to privatise and individualise rangeland areas also lacks
                  these essential regulatory conditions, and many features of rangeland use have
                  changed little since the collectivist era. Most significantly the problem of free-riding
                  remains unresolved. ";P.

eldis:A67835;Doubling irrigation for southern Africa – do we have enough water and where is the hope?;;"Southern Africa Development Communality (SADC) through its Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) has set up an ambitious goal to double irrigation by 2015, which it sees as important component to sustain regional development and ensure food security. While the target timeline is questionable with year 2015 fast approaching, the goal to increase irrigated areas to 7% is certainly valid and has significant implications for regional food security and livelihood of rural population.

The objective of this paper is to examine water resources in conjunction with the status of irrigation development in SADC region, and assess water availability for irrigation development. The desktop analysis builds largely upon literature, existing projects and products to integrate baseline information. The results reveal that water is sufficiently available for doubling irrigation without hampering too much on environment even with the possible impacts imposed by climate change. The potential is however largely variable from country to country, and basin to basin. To make irrigation sustainable and cost-benefit effective, irrigation expansion needs to undertake smart water resources/storages development to avoid significant impact on ecosystem functions which are all supported by water.

eldis:A67839; Increasing the resilience of dryland agro-ecosystems to climate change;;"The current debate on climate change, its impacts on socio-ecological systems and the role of agriculture has shifted from an emphasis on how to mitigate the effects of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to how to prepare and adapt to the expected adverse impacts. This follows the recognition that the climate is already changing as a result of mankind’s activities and there is little that can be done to prevent further increases in atmospheric concentrations of GHG in the short term.

It is clear that strategies for adaptation to climate change will need to embrace different sectors, support development and will be interdependent, requiring collaboration amongst multiple stakeholders, ranging from resource managers to policy makers. There is a need to be more proactive rather than reactive and to focus first on measures that achieve multiple goals, i.e., that address not only the impacts of climate change but also other stresses such as land degradation or desertification. In this brief review we highlight such measures that are being developed by the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) for the world’s non-tropical drylands.

eldis:A16722;Rush and ruin: the devastating mineral trade in Southern Katanga;;This report explores how the illicit trade in cobalt and copper in Katanga (south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo) is contributing to the destruction of the country’s economy, the environment as well as the livelihoods of thousands of Congolese people.As the report demonstrates, the volume of the illegal mineral trade is immense. In March 2004 the Central Bank of Congo reported the DRC produced 783 tonnes of cobalt metal. In the same month, the DRC’s customs office reported 13,365 tonnes of cobalt metal was exported, a difference of over 12,00 tonnes, which can be accounted to the illicit trade.This huge volume of illegal trade takes away the crucial mining revenues from the copperbelt, which could provide much-needed revenue for the Congolese government to support the economic development that the DRC so desperately needs.In addition, the illegal trade breeds poverty and instability. Artisanal mining is being carried out in dangerous and uncontrolled conditions, with thousands of miners risking their lives to earn around US$1 a day. The DRC has in place a new Mining Code designed to attract foreign investment by providing a legal framework that provides clarity and certainty. However, due to a lack of regulatory capacity and possible also political will, the Code is yet to be applied on the ground in Katanga.The report offers a number of recommendations, including:the international donor communityand the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) should put pressure on the transitional government to publicly disclose existing mining contracts and revenuesIFIs and the donor community should commit themselves to developing alternative employment opportunities for ex- workers and other unemployed people in Katangathe transitional government should commit itself to making anti-corruption, transparency and accountability priority areas by publishing the results of systems and finance audits of the Ministry of Mines, Cadastre Minier and Ministry of Finance. ;;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"environment;mining;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"202;COD";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16722;http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/217/Rush%20and%20Ruin%20-%20Sept%2004.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Fmedia_library_get.php%2F217%2FRush%2520and%2520Ruin%2520-%2520Sept%252004.pdf;;;;"copper;transparency;cobalt;Environment;Biodiversity and environment;Extractive industries mining;Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;Extractive industries;Minerals;(DRC)"
eldis:A12618;Tenure, diversity, and commitment: community participation for urban service provision;;This paper examines factors influencing a household’s willingness to participate in community based service provision programs. Using data from a recently completed geo-referenced household survey for Bangalore, India, two important hypotheses on why households engage in collective action are tested: does tenure security enhance the probability of participation mainly because the resulting appreciation in housing values can be capitalised and the anticipated benefit stream from service provision is accrued over a longer period? The authors find that security of tenure has a significant and positive impact on the willingness to participate in collective action for access to urban servicesdoes  heterogeneity in endowments or culture reduce the willingness of residents to participate in activities that are expected to yield economic benefits or improvements in living standards?In addition to the effects of tenure security and heterogeneity, the authors find that participation is most prevalent in middle class households and communities. This supports the theory that the perceived benefits of participation do not offset the cost of interaction for the rich who can either privately obtain the service or may already have access to most basic services. The transaction cost of participation (especially in heterogeneous settings) is high for the poor due to limited levels of community trust, as reflected in various focus group interviewsRapid population growth in developing country cities creates an ever increasing demand for basic public services. City governments often do not have the capacity, know-how and fiscal resources to provide adequate services to newcomers while addressing the existing backlog in under-serviced areas. Public provision is therefore not always efficient and affordable, and sometimes does not consider the needs of individual communities.If self-provision of urban services by local communities and neighbourhoods can be considered a useful complement to public and private provision, a major policy question is how community action can be encouraged and facilitated by governments and donors. To answer that question we need to know more about what motivates individuals to engage in community initiatives.There is general consensus that community action in the provision of urban services is a viable option when the public sector is unable and the private sector unwilling to invest. However, actual evidence on the success of such efforts is relatively scarce, and there is not enough data about the factors that determine success or failure. Also, as the urban population in developing countries is predicted to double over the next 30 years, all options for ensuring access to basic services need to be considered. An important question then is whether community based service provision is scalable. To make a significant difference, there is a need to expand such programs to a very large number of urban communities. How to facilitate successful community initiatives and how to transfer successful implementations quickly and widely are important questions for researchers and policy makers alike. ;"S.V. Lall

The report specifically examines REDD+ and PES, highlighting successful examples of PES in Costa Rica and community forestry in Guatemala. The report concludes that criteria for successful incentive mechanisms include: the provision of clear economic incentives; the ability to demonstrate community and livelihood benefits; ethnic belonging and associated agreement on resource use rules; and a strong sense of community or communal living.

eldis:A71894;From Brazilian fields to Norwegian farms;;"• Brazil has a Federal Constitution and consolidated legislation that provide for the protection of the environment, health and welfare of workers in rural areas.
• The large-scale agricultural export model used in Brazil, i.e. the state of Mato Grosso and particularly in the region where the soy exported to Norway is produced, has been causing severe social and environmental impacts.
• Although Norway is a relatively small player in the global soy market, it has been a leader in the effort to fight deforestation of tropical forests and ensuring good sustainability standards throughout global production chains.
• Denofa, through its Brazilian partner Amaggi, is responsible for most of the soybeans imported from Brazil to Norway; despite Denofa’s good efforts to maintain best sustainability standards throughout its production chain, important challenges still remain to be addressed.
• Openness and transparency of the entire supply chain are key elements to corporate social responsibility. Denofa possesses detailed information on suppliers and cargoes shipped from Brazil to Norway. However, the company has so far refused to disclose such information based on business sensitive reasons that are not entirely clear.
• Denofa relies on comprehensive certification schemes managed by Amaggi to ensure the highest possible sustainability standards in the soy production chain. However, there are certain limitations related to such certificate schemes that may jeopardize the traceability vis a vis the actual situation on the ground. Lack of autonomous third-party verification and full confidentiality clauses are limitations that represent a breach in standards of transparency.
• Interviews with local farmers during the field trip evidence that a departure from Brazilian laws and certification standards may exist in the following areas:
• Use and spraying of pesticides close to houses and villages, which even if compliant with local regulations, represent an unacceptable risk to the health of residents and workers in the areas where the soy exported to Norway is produced.
• Failure to comply with federal and state forest laws by suppliers;
• Concern that Denofa may be importing soy planted inside indigenous lands, in violation of the Constitution.

eldis:A34143;The right to land and a livelihood: the dynamics of land tenure systems in Conda, Amboim and Sumbe municipalities;;"What are the dynamics of land tenure in the CAS (Conda, Ambuim, and Sumbe) area in Angola? What are its opportunities and risks? This paper reveals a denial of land access rights to communal farmers, whose livelihoods are centred on land. The paper states that the perhaps greatest contribution the new Land Law has made to improve communal land tenure is that it recognises customary ownership rights (Article.34) and it attempts to provide a legal framework for dealing with land problems that transcend the customary systems.However, the findings of this study reveal that tenure insecurity is experienced throughout the CAS area. The main forms of land tenure security include: unclear or restricted land rights, land alienation by powerful individuals or groups of commercial farmers, limited women's land rights, and the lack of awareness of laws, policies, and rights.The author points out that unless efforts are made to bring a more balanced share of land into the two main types of tenure – communal and large scale commercial – social development efforts will produce only a minimal impact on livelihood security.Recommendations include:

    advocacy at the local and central level
    improving land tenure systems

eldis:A74214;Property and prosperity: reforming landholding in Africa;;"How Africans access – or ‘own’ – their landholdings is a matter of profound importance for the continent’s future. It touches on social welfare as well as prospects for economic development. This policy briefing provides an overview of the land question, drawing heavily on the Country Review Reports (CRRs) of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). It argues that weak property rights are a major problem for Africa, but cautions against an assumption that full titling is an immediate solution. Rather, drawing on existing informal rights regimes in Africa – and gradually building formalised systems on this basis – offers a more promising avenue for creating effective and durable systems of property rights aligned with the continent’s realities.

Recommendations:


	enhance property rights through informal mechanisms that recognise the capacity and financial limitations of African states. Universal formal titling may not at this point be feasible, but it is a worthwhile long-term aspiration
	improve the capacity of African states to manage the administrative complexities of landholding and the gradual adoption of formal titles
	invest in support for rural economies, with an emphasis on agriculture, with a view to boosting their productivity
	research and understand the complex political economy of landholding – land retains a great deal of conflict potential. Policy approaches must be mindful of and sensitive to this

eldis:A56354;Conflict over forests and land in Asia;;"Tenure and claims over forests and land are highly contested throughout Asia where states retain full ownership of land. Competition for land for investment, resource extraction, and conservation is becoming more common. The conflict takes place between local communities and indigenous peoples and external Government agencies and developers. This paper sheds light on how conflict begins, how it affects actors involved and how it can be successfully managed. It states that he impacts of conflicts include anxiety and fear, disharmony and division among social groups, distrust, high costs, and environmental degradation. The positive impacts include increased collective community action and a better understanding of the importance of clarifying tenure ambiguity. The paper presents the following underlying causes of conflict:

    Contested tenure and overlapping claims
    A lack of coordination among State agencies
    Conservation and economic development policies that prioritize global and national interests over local interests, needs, and aspirations.

The direct causes of conflict include:

    Destruction of community economic and social assets by developers in mining, logging, plantation development
    Loss of income and livelihood opportunities due to the establishment of conservation areas
    Eviction of local communities from their land
    Air and noise pollution caused by logging, plantation, and mining operations
    Jobs unavailable for community members but reserved for outsiders.

The paper states that conflict management which has included co-management arrangements have also been central to mediation efforts. Negotiations did not yield solutions in some instances where attempts were made. Mediation was more successful in some cases. Military-backed coercion was employed in some cases. To reduce the future incidence of conflict, the paper proposes the following short- and long-term actions beginning with the short-term ones:

    Encourage early consultation with resident local populations prior to making decisions about land-use changes
    Ensure coordination between Government agencies with overlapping mandates
    Promote co-management arrangements in which actors agree upon a strategy to fairly share management responsibilities
    Call upon governments to remain neutral and avoid taking sides in conflicts between local communities and companies.

The long-term actions are:

    Clarify tenure arrangements and land-use policies to minimize the likelihood of resource conflict
    Strengthen mediation skills across Asia to ensure local capacity to manage conflict
    Respect local resource management and ensure economic development also benefits local communities
    Integrate local livelihood strategies into conservation policy to balance top-down processes and decrease conflict caused by unilateral enforcement.

eldis:A12434;Tides shift on agrarian reform: new movements show the way;;This paper first introduces the concept of land redistribution of land through agrarian reform, that would allow for a more inclusive model of development. The author then demonstrates how land concentration leads to displacement (migration) of rural populations, and as a consequence increased  pressure in urban centres.  In citing the World Bank's approach to comprehensive land reform and tenure systems, concerns are raised as being:how privatisation of communal lands could lead to instances of extraction based profiteering, to the exclusion of othersthe registration of land and subsequent facilitation of land markets could lead to a glut in the demand for land, as people sell off land in massRisks associated with market-led distribution as landowners sell off  marginal  (fragile) land, and increase use of unsustainable practises (e.g. pesticides) to enhance productivity. This in turn could lead to environmental degradationExacerbating poverty through saddling the poorer beneficiary families with heavy debt that cover the market-led aspects of the reform.Bank supported reform packages are often based on mechanisms that are seen to increase land degradation and poverty through the introduction of non-traditional export crops, increased use of pesticides, & chemical fertilizersIn response to this, the author puts forward some useful principles to be considered when dealing with the World Bank reform policies, and argues that the policy process tends to be drawn out, and it is this delay that paves the way for social movements to take the lead in addressing the question of land reform. ;P.

eldis:A22427;Developing local capacity for management of natural resource conflicts in Africa: a review of key issues, approaches, and outcomes;;"This research paper critically evaluates the key issues and approaches in community-based natural resource conflict management.  This assessment is done in light of USAID’s recent framework ""Nature, Wealth, and Power"" (NWP). The purpose of the framework is to provide a clearer understanding of challenges and options regarding natural resource conflicts and attempts to manage or resolve them.  Land and natural resources are vital to livelihoods and identities of people in Africa.  Therefore conflicts over their access and use necessitate special attention from those concerned with its development.This paper begins with an evaluation of the NWP framework.  It analyses some of its assumptions about conflict management and the broader agenda of African development. The author argues that the framework offers a positive programme for action but can be strengthened by contextualising more clearly the conditions and trends it tries to address. For instance, what are the sources of the issues and problems associated with nature/resources, wealth/economics, and power/governance highlighted in NWP? What contributes to their perpetuation? Such information is vital for proper planning, including overcoming obstacles and pitfalls arising from inaccurate or incorrect assumptions.The next two sections of this research paper examine the social and historical dimensions of African land and natural resource conflicts. The analysis identifies the intractable nature of many of these conflicts, which originate in inequalities embedded in the national policy frameworks set up for administering land during the colonial era. It also describes efforts in recent decades by independent African governments to reform their national policies through a range of interventions, including many recent participatory endeavors. At the same time, the paper reveals how political, economic, demographic, and other socioeconomic factors are altering people’s relationship to land and to each other, triggering more conflicts.The paper concludes with by examining current practices in natural resource conflict management. The author explores some current patterns, especially how people make use of a range of legal orders and of conflict management processes in trying to resolve conflicts. The study also looks at strengths and weaknesses of three major modes of conflict management processes: Alternative Dispute Resolution, which is popular with international donors; national legal systems; and informal conflict management, which the NWP framework identifies as highly significant.The author draws the following conclusion from his research:a multifaceted approach to conflict resolution is vital in the African contextit is crucial in conflict resolution to pay attention to issues of democratisation, national policy and legislative reform, and agrarian change, particularly the socioeconomic and demographic processes fostering intensified competition for land and resourcesinvolve a range of conflict management processes, including national legal systems, alternative dispute resolution, and informal conflict management practices, while paying close attention to each process’s strengths and weaknessescareful attention should be given particularly to issues regarding accessibility and participation by women, the poor, and other socially subordinate groupsgiven the popularity of Alternative Dispute Resolution among international donors, evaluations need to be done to determine its effectiveness and impacts.

eldis:A67301;Assessing competitive resource tenders as an option for mining rights allocation in South Africa;;"The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment Bill of 2013 (MPRD-AB) has generated fresh debate regarding the appropriate system for allocating mineral prospecting and mining rights in South Africa. The draft bill no longer specifies that mining rights are to be allocated according to the first-in, first-assessed (FIFA) principle.

This paper aims to inform the current debate, focusing in particular on competitive resource allocation systems (also referred to as mineral rights auction or tender systems), which certain stakeholders have proposed as an alternative to the existing FIFA system. The focus on competitive resource allocation systems is also informed by Minister of Mineral Resources Susan Shabangu’s 2012 budget vote speech, in which she stated that the Department of Mineral Resources intended to begin a process of auctioning lapsed or revoked mining licences.

eldis:A29410;A review of changes in rangeland vegetation and livestock populations for Northern Kenya;;This  review explores environmental change in northern and south-central Kenya, roughly covering three decades from the 1960s to the 1990s. The report answers three questions:has vegetation change occurred in these districts?if vegetation change has occurred, why and how has this happened?what are the trends for livestock populations?The article concludes that:rangeland sites have been fundamentally altered by woody encroachment over the past 40 years. This has resulted from concentration of grazing pressure that has occurred due to declines in the mobility of pastoral people and their herds. Human population growth, insecurity, inadequate distribution of key resources, and the lure of markets and public services are all implicated in this patternlivestock populations have not changed in numbers or species composition, as is evident from aeriel survey datathe lack of livestock number/species trend detection may be complicated by the imprecision of aerial survey data, the possibility that major changes in livestock populations occurred before the period of aerial survey, and/or the presence of non-forage factors such as epidemic disease and livestock raiding that can exert marked influences on population dynamics ;"M.

This thesis, is based on the follwing legs of argument, as follows:


    
    
    The pastoral human population is growing at about 2.5% per year
    
    
    
    
    A certain minimum number of livestock are needed to support these humans as pastoralists, even at very low levels of welfare. 
    
    
    
    
    The maximum total pastoral herd size is limited by the amount of livestock feed available. Where numbers temporarily exceed this limit they soon die back.
    
    
    
    
    In pastoral areas where Leg 4 of the argument is not yet the case, nevertheless widespread unbearable poverty already prevails because the total livestock herd is not equitably distributed between households. 
    
    
    
    
    The area of land accessible for pastoral use can not be significantly increased, e.g. by water development, and is in fact shrinking, as a result of the expansion of cultivation and of wildlife conservation areas. 
    
    
    
    
    There are no known technologies for significantly increasing primary range production, thereby permitting a larger aggregate herd size. 
    
    
    
    
    Overall herd productivity can not substantially improve unless the quantity and quality of feed is improved. 
    
    
    
    
    The patches of rain-fed cultivation which pepper the rangelands of GHA are, at present, technically, environmentally and economically inefficient. 
    
    
    
    
    The market prospects are not very favourable for increasing the unit value of pastoralists’ livestock 
    
    
    
    
    The prospects for other kinds of income diversification within the pastoral areas are unfavourable
    
    


The implications of this thesis are that a solution to the fundamental imbalance needs to be found in a combination of the following strategies: 


    
    
    The emigration of a substantial proportion of pastoralists from both substantial dependence on livestock and from pastoral areas. 
    
    
    
    
    The development, within or near pastoral areas, of more productive and more sustainable rain-fed or irrigated crop-agriculture into which previous pastoralists can switch their livelihoods; 
    
    
    
    
    The development of diversified income-earning opportunities not dependent on demand from within pastoral areas (e.g. in the production and gathering of “pharmaceutical” 3 products). 
    
    
    
    
    Reducing/reversing/ population growth. 
    
    
    
    
    A much greater (and more successful than hitherto) emphasis on improving range (the per hectare, primary, edible) productivity, thereby allowing more livestock to be kept, coupled with enhanced efforts to increase animal productivity. 
    
    
    
    
    A program to obtain higher prices for pastoralists’ livestock products by reform of the internal marketing system, and/or by “market development” (reaching new markets requiring higher quality and higher price products) or by a price stabilization scheme. 
    
    
    
    
     Additional (to the above) policy reforms (including land tenure) to facilitate the above.

eldis:A45454;World water and food to 2025: dealing with scarcity;;"The key messages of this presentation are:

    
    Increasing competition for water severely limits irrigation and constrains food production
    
    
    Slow progress in extending access to safe drinking water; water quality will decline; amount of water for environmental uses will be inadequate
    
    
    Moderate worsening in current water policies and investments could lead to full-blown water crisis
    
    
    Fundamental changes in water management and policy can produce a sustainable future for water and food
    

The presentation uses the Water Simulation Model to estimate effective water for irrigation and rain fed production based on climate parameters, infrastructure, and policy inputs. It suggests three approaches to the state of availability of water:

    
    Business as usual scenario; assumes continuation of existing trends:
    

Continued decline in crop research investments
Declining investment in irrigation expansion and reservoir storage
Limited institutional and management reform
Water use efficiency increases slowly
Slow growth in harvested area
Production increase mainly through yield growth
Low priority of rainfed agriculture
Expansion of groundwater pumping
No increase in environmental flows

    
    Water crisis scenario; assumes worsening of existing policies and trends:
    

Sharp reduction in investment in water storage, O&M
Degradation of irrigation infrastructure and management
Reduced water use efficiency
Lower investment in rainfed crop breeding and slower growth in rainfed crop yields
Increased erosion and sedimentation
Decline in net water storage due to reduced investment and sedimentation
Reduction in environmental flows
Low investment in water supply systems, decline in access to household water services. 

    Sustainable water use scenario; Assumes improvement of existing policies and trends and focus on environment:

Increase in investment in rainfed crop research and higher growth in rainfed yields
Medium growth in water storage; reduced sedimentation balances lower investment
Higher water use efficiency due to water management reform and higher agricultural water prices
More effective use of rainfall
Increased water prices and higher investment in water supply systems
Sharp increase in reserved environmental flows
Elimination of groundwater overdraft
 
The policy conclusions presented are as follows:

    Reform of water management policies, and investments to improve water efficiency
    Water price incentives and water trading
    Increasing crop productivity: water management, agricultural research and rural investment.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) has become a well-established developmental sector into which domestic water naturally falls. However, efforts to improve rural water supply services may benefit from more inter-disciplinary collaboration.

Given the vast numbers of rural people with inadequate drinking water supplies, the report argues that it may be time to build better synergies between WASH efforts and other work to reduce poverty, address power imbalances and improve environmental sustainability.

An improved understanding by water supply professionals and practitioners of the broader context of rural like, politics and the environment is highlighted as a good starting point. Likewise, for those working to improve rural livelihoods, address reduce poverty, and ensure environmental sustainability, a basic under-standing of rural water supplies is important.

eldis:A70145;Access to affordable land for housing: initial regulatory impact assessment ;;"In South Africa, provision of affordable, well-situated housing close to existing services and work places is hampered by the high cost and scarcity of appropriate land. Consequently, most new low-income housing projects have been developed on the urban periphery. This tends to entrench the spatial differentiation of residential areas by race and class characteristics of the apartheid era and increased the cost of providing services to low-income housing projects inhabitants.

Presently, no policy mechanism by which the state can proactively acquire high-value land for affordable housing projects is in place. One of the acknowledged problems with the current approach to the acquisition of land for housing is that it is reactive and demand-driven. Although well-located land does come onto the market, aligning the acquisition of this land with government approval for low-income housing projects has proven difficult. Also, the current housing subsidy is not sufficient to meet the difference between the cost of well-located land and the end-price that those in need of affordable housing are able to pay.

This paper examines the proposed Housing Development Agency Bill and asserts that in order to properly address this, better information on average land values, which will assist in calculating the average land loss figure, is needed. The cost-benefit analysis in respect of the creation of a HDA indicates that the success of this option in economic terms is highly dependent on the assumption that this option will lead to a reduction in transport costs.

The paper identifies a number of risks associated with the establishment of the HDA, including the risk of problematic arrangements between NDoH and DLA, unavailability of funds for land acquisition, direct compete between the HDA and private sector, perception that HADs are over-riding the constitutional mandate of provinces and municipalities and that the provision of high-value, well-located land at subsidised rates may be seen as unfair by housing beneficiaries whose land costs were not subsidised in this way.

The author recommends that there is a need for further consultation between the NDoH, provincial and municipal government on the implementation of the HDA option and improved coordination between the NDoH and other departments affected by the HDA proposal.

eldis:A29866;Responding to climate change: on the ground in Honduras;;Report on project in Honduras aimed at assessing the potential for carbon sequestration through both establishing new plantations and conservation of existing forests. At the same time the goal was to illustrate that a project to sequester  CO2 could also lead to better forest and land management, and improve the economic and social well-being of vulnerable communities through the participation of community groups and local organizations.The paper gives some policy background to the interest in carbon sequestration (UNFCCC, Kyoto, Clean Development Mechanism) and outlines the process of identifying areas for potential carbon offset credits where this added value may contribute to sustainable management. It also gives a brief overview of forestry and land use issues in the Central American context.The author then asseses the project area by calculating the base line carbon store against a 'business as usual' projection based on current management and a 'with project' projection based on a change of suitable land use to sustainable management systems and  agroforestry projects.

eldis:A16932;TOTAL Oil: fuelling the oppression in Burma;;Coinciding with the launch of a new international campaign calling for TOTAL’s withdrawal from Burma, this report gathers together much of the available evidence relating to TOTAL’s role in fuelling the oppressive dictatorship in Burma. It explores human rights abuses associated with TOTAL’s gas pipeline, TOTAL’s financing of Burma’s dictatorship and TOTAL’s influence on French foreign policy and therefore on European Burma policy as a whole.The report finds that:one of the most significant consequence of TOTAL’s presence in Burma is its influence on French foreign policy: in order to protect TOTAL’s interests, the French government has become an obstacle to any strengthening of the EU’s Common Position on Burma, particular with regard to economic sanctionsTOTAL’s project provides significant annual revenue to the regime, which has helped the regime to build its military capacity and therefore its control of the country’s population, impeding the prospect of democratic changedespite being aware of the possible dangers, the TOTAL opted to employ, through MOGE (Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise), the services of the Burmese Army which is internationally renowned for its extreme and unrelenting brutalitythere are serious allegations that TOTAL’s money has been used by the regime to cover its money laundering activities through MOGE in order to purchase armsthe ‘constructive engagement’ that TOTAL claims to have been carrying out in Burma over the last decade has not resulted in a single democratic reform by the regime.The report highlights that TOTAL withdrawal from Burma would end the company’s support for the regime, deter future foreign investment in Burma and open the way to a French foreign policy that no longer undermines Burma’s pro-democracy movement. The report recommends that civil society organisations concerned with making corporations accountable for their actions join the international coalition on TOTAL. ;;;Burma Campaign, UK;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;"030;009;MMR";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16932;http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/PDFs/total%20report.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.burmacampaign.org.uk%2FPDFs%2Ftotal%2520report.pdf;;;;"Burma;Corporate Social Responsibility;dictatorship;Extractive industries oil;oil;Extractive industries;pipline"
eldis:A16628;Towards better woodland management in the Sahelian Mali;;This article begins with an investigation into woodland management in Mali and moves onto a discussion of some of the fundamental practical problems associated with a major part of forest policy in Mali. The article focuses on how to increase villagers' control and management of their resources.The article finds that:it is difficult complicated to encourage management of open or restricted access common property when the attitude of users leads irrevocably towards  a  tragedy-of-the-commons situationthe work of this programme adds restrictions to rules governing access to the woodland in one part of Mali (Bouna) and an increase in the power of habitual users over itinerant or occasional usersa consequence of this is that herders will develop a protectionist attitude to demonstrate that the wood is trully managed by them and to improve grazing quality for their own animals by excluding other herdsthe forestry policy described in the paper, could, if extended over parts of the Sahelian zone in Mali, encourage a trend towards privatisation and a pressure towards increasing sedenterisation due to protectionism against transhumant herds. This would restrict the flexibility necessary to transhumant herds to survive unpredictable climatic fluctuationsthe key to socially and ecologically stable relations between communities of pastoralists is the respect of kinship relations and mutually agreed reciprocal access rights ;J.

eldis:A16836;Economic reforms and development strategy in Gujarat;;"The Gujarat state government has followed a strategy focussed on industrialisation and urbanisation with an open door policy ever since its inception in 1960. Economic reform measures at the centre with an explicit emphasis on trade and industry considerably benefited Gujarat, making its economic performance outstanding.  During the process of economic policy reforms and liberalisation in the 1990s, the constraints and regulation on economic activities by the centre in different segments of the economy got relaxed.  States such as Gujarat found more freedom and flexibility to pursue their own socio-economic agenda, particularly since the process of liberalisation seemed to have had a slowing-down effect on the state economy.This paper examines the development strategy followed by Gujarat’s state government in the mid-1990’s.  The paper looks at the concepts of economic reforms and liberalisation and their possible impact on the level of economic activity in an economy.  The specific instruments used by the State Government of Gujarat to promote economic growth through the private sector are also discussed, and these include:Tax and Cost-Related IncentivesProvision of Infrastructure & Input SuppliesApprovals and Clearances for IndustriesLand Market ReformsThe paper finds that:the 6 sectors that do not show statistically significant acceleration/deceleration in the growth include agriculture, registered manufacturing, electricity, railways, other transport, and storageforestry unregistered manufacturing, construction, trade and hotels, communication, public administration, and other services have experienced significant acceleration in their growth after 1991-92the fishing, mining & quarrying, banking & insurance, and real estate sectors in Gujarat are experiencing a significant deceleration in their growth during the reform periodThe paper concludes by noting that during the initial phase of liberalising the industrial sector by the Centre, Gujarat did not have to make any major changes in its policies. The changes in the economic environment made its strategy and policies followed till that point very relevant and attractive for the growth of the private enterprise in the state.  This process has however led to a conflict of desires for the State Government.  Within the overall strategy of ""growth through private enterprise,"" the State wanted to achieve high efficiency and productivity growth of resources employed in the state while simultaneously attempting to protect some of the less efficient small and medium enterprises from the global competition with all kinds of subsidies.  This confusion in policy decision-making has slowed down the gains made from liberalisation, and the author argues that unless direction is provided from New Delhi, the development of Gujarat cannot get back on track.

eldis:A29869;State of the forest: Indonesia;;Joint report from Forest Watch Indonesia, World Resources Institute and  Global Forest Watch. It provides a detailed analysis of the scale and pace of change affecting Indonesia’s forests. The report concludes that the doubling of deforestation rates in Indonesia is largely the result of a corrupt political and economic system that regards natural resources as a source of revenue to be exploited for political ends and personal gain. The political  instability that followed the economic crises of 1997 and the eventual ousting of former President Suharto in 1998 further increased deforestation to its current level.The key findings of the report are as follows: Indonesia is experiencing one of the highest rates of tropical forest loss in the worldDeforestation in Indonesia is largely the result of a corrupt political and economic system that regarded natural resources, especially forests, as a source of revenue to be exploited for political ends and personal gainIllegal logging has reached epidemic proportions as a result of Indonesia's chronic structural imbalance between legal wood supply and demandMore than 20 million hectares of forest have been cleared since 1985, but the majority of this land has not been put to productive alternative usesThe Indonesian government is facing mounting pressure domestically and internationally to take action, but progress is slow and not all policy reforms in process are necessarily good news for forests [authors] Full document is available as a PDF (very large file) or Zipped PDF.

eldis:A13486;Role of policies and development interventions in pastoral resource management: the Borana rangelands in southern Ethiopia;;Built on earlier quantitative assessment of the socio-economic drivers of the above changes, this paper focuses on the role of national level policies implemented in the area over the past decades, and how these have affected the traditional institutional setting that determines land use, property rights and pathways of livestock development.The paper uses a literature review combined with in-depth key informant and group interviews to identify key policies and interventions, assess their impacts and explore the responses and strategies adopted at both individual and community levels to cope with the changing situation.Conclusions:the advent of cultivation in the overwhelming majority of the communities coincides with the creation of the peasant associations, which formally endorse private rights to croplands, as opposed to the now weakened authority of the traditional elders. So whatever the incentives generated by internal socio-economic, demographic and market variables, the previous strong system of communal resource management may have been responsible for the virtual absence of cultivation in Borana before the creation of the peasant associationsthe emerging pressure on the rangelands is not only a function of demographic and socio-economic variables, but also environmental variables such as bush encroachmentthe development of road networks and market centres in the last decades increased the interaction of pastoralists and neighbouring agro-pastoral ethnic groups. This interaction could be associated with incentives such as lower information and learning costs for the adoption of crops. The impact of droughts should also be recognised in the sense that many communities reported the drought prone nature of the area to be the primary reason for staying together as commons. That is, the maintenance of common property grazing arrangements and the failure of some communities to adopt crops are motivated by a desire to guarantee mobility at all times ;"A. Kamara

eldis:A20110;Building an international legal framework on animal genetic resources: can it help the drylands and food-insecure countries?;;This article discusses the case for an international treaty on animal genetic resources, confirming that one-third of the world’s livestock breeds are now endangered. It argues that animal genetic resources are essential for food security from at least two angles:as a means of utilising marginal environments not suitable for crop cultivationas building blocks for future livestock development that will enable animal producers to respond to changes in production circumstances and new consumer preferences.While animal genetic resources are subject to national sovereignty, regional and international cooperation is necessary. Breeds occur across borders, and market failures to conserve genetic diversity warrant public intervention. Market forces currently favour intensive or industrialised animal monocultures, while production systems that conserve genetic diversity are not rewarded for this service.Many of the countries and regions that are richest in animal genetic resources are very food insecure, so supporting dryland communities through better infrastructure, services, animal health care, marketing opportunities and other interventions would make a significant contribution to both poverty alleviation and food security. It would also contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of animal genetic resources.An international legal framework on animal genetic resources would seek to create a level playing field between dryland production systems that conserve genetic diversity, and intensive and industrialised systems that erode it. In defending their interests, dryland countries with pastoral populations and rich animal genetic resources could form a unified bloc for negotiations on an international legal framework on animal genetic resources. ;I.

eldis:A13485;Land rights in crisis: restoring tenure security in Afghanistan;;This paper summarises the findings of a short exercise to identify land issues in present-day Afghanistan. This review addresses the way in which rights in land are distributed, secured, transacted and governed and the problems that surround these processes.Findings include:stark inequities in land ownership, ethnic conflict over land access, and mismanaged land reform efforts by the state have all played a role in generating and sustaining conflict, including Soviet occupation, over the last 25 yearsconflict has seriously disturbed land relations, de-securing farm and pasture rights in some areas, jeopardising the ability of administrators or courts to manage or uphold rights fairly, and threatening confidence in the capacity of the constitution or other state law to protect existing land rightslandlessness and indebtedness are likely to involve a greater proportion of farmers than 25 years ago. Population growth and land shortage, opium poppy production, ethnic tension, insecurity, and more recently, drought, remain potent drivers to land grabbing, landlessness and destitutionpasture land is a principle source of conflict. Competition over this valuable resource engenders conflict among settled and nomadic land users and ethnic and territorial concerns. It also brings to light conceptual differences about if, how, and in what situations, people may own land in common and have those rights upheld as private property. It also highlights the conflicting positions as to rightful reach of government land and government powers over propertya plural legal basis to land rights exists, in the form of customary, religious and state law, and with a great deal of overlap, some inconsistency and much uncertainty as to norms in each body of law. Landowners variously use custom, Shariat or evidence from the land register to demonstrate their rights.

eldis:A72224;Addressing land degradation: benefits, costs, and policy directions;;"Land degradation in the Philippines is a serious environmental problem with long-term implications for the sustainability of agricultural production. Protection of the resource base has thus become a policy priority, whether in terms of improving crop management in the lowlands or more urgently, arresting soil erosion in the uplands. This review aims to compile and evaluate estimates of the costs of land degradation; then analyze the costs, benefits, and equity implications of priority measures to protect soil resources; and lastly, draw implications for policy.

The author finds that the most important cause of land degradation in the Philippines is soil erosion. Despite wide variations in the figures, and considerable uncertainty about the degradation parameters, even the most conservative methods lead to large estimates of the cost of soil erosion, comparable at least to the annual investment in research and development of the public sector. Direct interventions such as promotion of soil-conserving farm technologies are worthwhile investments based on social benefit-cost analysis. Owing to liquidity and other constraints, however, farmers may forego these investments. Indirect interventions such as tenure reform have an ambiguous effect on soil erosion; however, removal of domestic protection of corn has a positive effect on soil conservation. Upland farmers, including the large population of subsistence corn growers, are among the poorest segments of the rural population. The review supports increasing and widening incentives for adoption of soil conservation and permanent tree crops through extension and improved tenurial measures, while ensuring that trade adjustment be accompanied by adequate social protection.

eldis:A57103;Land investments or land grab?: a critical view from Tanzania and Mozambique;;"This report discusses the potential benefits of, and the current challenges for, agricultural land investment in Tanzania and Mozambique. The paper finds that there is little, if any, development potential in these investments. Indeed, the economic growth potential of investments in agricultural land is questionable due to an inadequate regulatory framework governing foreign direct investments (FDI) in the sector. 
The document shows that FDI in agricultural sector in Tanzania and Mozambique can even jeopardise local resource users land rights. In this respect, the report highlights that farmers are giving away their most valuable assets to profit-seeking entities, based on information asymmetries and persuasion. The paper argues that this is not development, but it is land grabbing. In addition, the authors doubt whether the FDI projects analysed in the paper will spur significant developmental effects at the local level. 
The report introduces the following policy recommendations:

    investments must never happen at the expense of people’s food security, and environmental impact assessment and a socio-economic impact assessment must be made prior to any investment
    there must be full transparency and disclosure in FDI in land, so that the local resource users and other civil society actors are given the possibility to influence the process
    information asymmetries are to be avoided to ensure real participation in the acquisition process
    regulations on judicial and ethical standards should be internationalised, and an international governing body is needed in this relevance
    regional cooperation is the only way to avoid the “race-to-the-bottom” between developing countries
    increase the policy space in the WTO to regulate FDI in developing countries.

eldis:A69752;Angola and informal land tenure arrangements: towards an inclusive land policy;;"Angola, like Mozambique, inherited its legal framework from the Portuguese Civil Code, which was not based on a traditional African concept of community occupation under customary law. With Portuguese settlement, large areas of land were appropriated for and incorporated into the colonial cadastre (the formally surveyed and officially recorded land boundaries of the land concessions granted by the state). After winning independence from Portugal in 1975 the new Angolan government, influenced by socialist principles, affirmed the constitutional role of the state as the owner of all land. The post-independence constitution thus declared the state to be the owner and manager of land. Laws published in 1991 and 2004 adopted the colonial cadastre as the basis of land titling.

This paper, based on findings from research into the urban land market operating in low-income areas in Luanda, recognises the intense pressure on urban land experienced as a result of urban in-migration during and since the civil war. It shows the inability of the formal market to provide means for poorer people to access land, transact it and secure formal title or legally defensible land tenure.

According to the study, efficient and equitable land markets are a prerequisite for well-functioning cities. Dysfunctional land markets caused by poor land development and management (including poor urban planning, slow provision of infrastructure and services, poor land information systems, and cumbersome and slow  land transaction procedures, as well as under-regulation of private land development) lead to unplanned development of land in the urban periphery.

The study finds that the complexity of the urban land situation in Luanda requires a diversity of responses, not simplistic solutions. Above all, there is a need to move from the current practices to improved forms of land management, counting on popular support and engagement – otherwise any new system will be doomed to fail. The recommendations that follow are guided by two overarching principles:

(i) that existing practices should be integrated into an inclusive land policy. The study demonstrates that the existing informal mechanisms to access land are well established and have a strong legitimacy among the peri-urban population.

(ii) that more functional and inclusive land markets are required and should be promoted. The wide impact of urban development emphasises the need to maximise the socio-economic benefit for the majority of people, and not only in the formal private sector.

eldis:A17082;Mainstreaming climate change responses in economic development of Uruguay;;This paper assess Uruguay’s greenhouse gas emissions and economic performance, in addition to reviewing policies, plans and regulations which have resulted in land use changes and new forested areas with significant implications for climate change.  The paper also explores programs that can result in both socioeconomic development and an increased ability to mitigate climate change.The author stresses that the real opportunities for mainstreaming responses to climate change in national planning lie within the context of sectoral, environmental and economic policies. The paper’s analysis highlights Uruguay’s efforts and potentials for mainstreaming carbon-sequestration within the agricultural, forestry and energy sectors.The author notes a significant intersection between sectoral and climate change priorities, that can be seen in carbon dioxide sequestration in the agriculture and forestry sectors, responsible for more than 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. The author highlights that in the case of Uraguary, the impact of sectoral policies have been driven by conservation or economic development objectives on carbon-sequestration.The paper highlights a number of government actions that could improve mitigation of climate change through net carbon dioxide sequestration and emissions reductions, including:promotion of forest management practices aiming at obtaining significant volumes of timber suitable for long-lived productsinvestments in the development of technology for increasing forest productivity and proportion of high value logsincrease the area of improved pastures and improve their productivityexplore possible strategies to reduce the amount of methane emittedensure that the new annual crop areas are sown using as little till as possible and that it is done with accompanying areas of new improved pasturespromotion of use of wood and rice husks in electricity generation, based on small-scale units dispersed over the territory.The paper emphasises that strategic sectoral policies can create considerable synergies between climate change objectives, natural resource management and economic development priorities.This paper was presented at the OECD Global Forum on Sustainable Development: Development and Climate Change, Paris 2004.

eldis:A25987;Forests and climate change: role of forest lands as carbon sinks;;Forests potentially contribute to global climate change through their influence on the global carbon (C) cycle. They store large quantities of C in vegetation and soil, exchange C with the        atmosphere through photosynthesis and respiration, are sources of atmospheric C when they are disturbed, become atmospheric C sinks during abandonment and regrowth after disturbance, and can be managed to alter their role in the C cycle. The world's forest contain about 830 Pg C (1015 g) in their vegetation and soil, with about 1.5 times as much in soil as in vegetation. During the 1980s, analysis of C budgets show that forest of the temperate and     boreal countries were a net sink of atmospheric C of about 0.7 Pg yr-1, but the tropics were a  net source of about 1.6 Pg yr-1. However, accounting for the imbalance in the global C cycle  suggests that forest are not significantly contributing to the net increase in atmospheric CO2 and  thus not contributing to global climate change. However, this may not continue into the future     as temperate and boreal forests reach maturity and become a smaller C sink, and if rates of  tropical deforestation and degradation continue to accelerate. Recent studies suggest that there is the potential to manage forests to conserve and sequester C to mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide by an amount equivalent to 11-15% of the fossil fuel emissions over the same time  period. Aggressive adoption of these forest management options are necessary to prevent forests becoming a significant net source of CO2 to the atmosphere in the future and contributing to climate change. ;S.

eldis:A14629;Factor market imperfections and the land rental market in the highlands of Eritrea: theory and evidence;;This paper looks at the role of market imperfections in explaining leasing behaviour of households using sample data from the Highlands of Eritrea. It looks at the tenancy or land rental market, the position of households in that market (as landlords, tenants or non-participants) and assesses the transaction costs related to the adjustment process in the tenancy market.The paper tests for fixed and variable transaction costs related to adjustment in the land rental market. A two-stage approach for  participation in the market as landlords or tenants is used for this. Data from 32 villages in the highlands of Eritrea are used for the analysis. It offers:a literature surveya leasing model under imperfect markets for non-land factors and develop a set of testable hypothesesan outline of  the econometric models and discussion of estimation methods a presention of  the data and discussion of the results based on informal and formal analysis of the dataThe analysis demonstrates the importance of the land rental market for adjustment to nontradable or semitradable non-land household endowments. There were indications of  significantly higher fixed transaction costs faced by potential tenants than by potential landlords. ;"Mahari Okbasillassie Tikabol

eldis:A27868;Land Reforms: Prospects and Strategies;;Tries to understand the case for redistributive land reforms. Argues that there is relatively persuasive evidence showing that redistributing land may promote equity as well as efficiency. Suggest that it is, nevertheless, unclear, given that all forms of redistribution cost money as well as bureaucratic and political capital, that redistributing land is the best way to redistribute.The second part of the paper takes as given that policymakers want to redistribute land, and discusses strategies for achieving such redistribution. Argues that for the most part, redistribution should be based on a uniform land ceiling and not discriminate between different types of landlords but violations of the land ceiling may be permitted if the buyer is willing to pay a high enough price land reform programs should be accompanied by agricultural extension programs and emergency income support programspolicy should allow renting out redistributed land but restricting sales of such land market-assisted land reforms and tenancy reforms are possible alternative strategies where more traditional (coercive) land reform is not an option, but have significant disadvantages which should be taken seriously.[author]Paper presented at 1999 Annual World Bank Conference on Development Economics ;A.V.

eldis:A69840;Improving urban management in township;;"Improving urban management is a crucial precondition for developing South African townships. While the urban management deficit in these areas has deep historical roots, an array of contemporary problems also needs to be overcome if improvements are to be realised. Urban management, broadly defined, is about government’s responsibility for the planning, development and day-today operations of a city. While considerable variance exists, the paper states that most observers will agree that a defining feature of South African townships is the frequency and severity of problems associated with lack of urban management.

This paper explores the urban management challenge. It defines urban management, reviews its specific functions, explores the historical origins of the present management deficit in townships and isolates the factors that inhibit effective urban management today. The paper concludes by exploring ways to confront the urban management challenge.

Effective urban management requires the involvement of the private sector and community organisations. Managing the regulation, maintenance and operation of infrastructure and the public environment is essential to the success of township regeneration initiatives.

This study highlights issues such as crime, unregulated trading and non-performing infrastructure impede the operation of enterprises and markets as factors preventing townships and their residents from achieving their economic potential. Furthermore, it states that private sector investors consider regulation and the management of public spaces to be critical factors in how they allocate capital stating that good management of public spaces can be a make or break factor in investment.

The paper concludes by asserting that since urban management requires sustained effort over the long term, institutionalising such arrangements is key to success. A number of South African examples show how this can be done.

eldis:A39916;Rights-based approaches to forest conservation;;"In context of the recent emergence of the debate on rights-based approaches (RBA) to conservation, this paper provides a collaborative piece of work on the constitution of RBA’s and some of the key issues surrounding them. It also looks at some examples from countries where there is a need for RBA’s. The editors explain that the need for conservation to recognise the rights of those people who are most directly impacted by global conservation initiatives makes rights-based thinking not only a question of ethics and social justice but also a practical imperative for saving species and ecosystems. A rights-based approach is not about fulfilling a utopian dream of people and nature living in perfect harmony. When individuals and communities have rights over an area, they may act to safeguard some of its conservation values; however,  they will only do so if the right incentives are in place. It is asserted that there is no guarantee that people will exercise their rights in ways that preserve the ‘non-instrumental’ values, such as species diversity, that conservationists are particularly concerned about. Contributors to this paper write on a number of areas and raise numerous key points. These include:

    forest restoration, rights and power in the Ngitili forests of Shinyanga: while various reforms in Tanzania have encouraged the large-scale restoration of small woodlands, poor women explain that wealthy men were rapidly acquiring land for private ngitili forests for grazing their cattle, and too little land was being set aside for the needs of poorer users 
    Colombia’s new forest law rejected: Colombia’s Constitutional court ruled that the country’s General Forestry Law, enacted two years ago, was unconstitutional. This move follows an intensive campaign by a coalition of campaigners and legal experts and representatives of forest communities who opposed the law on the grounds that it violated the rights of Indigenous People and Afro-Colombians
    human rights and forest conservation: there is no comprehensive instrument specifically designed to address the links between conservation and human rights. RBA may be a powerful instrument to combine conservation interests with human rights protection
    righting the wrongs done to India’s forest dwellers: a new has been developed to counter the unequal distribution of power between forest departments and communities.

eldis:A25334;Does more for the poor mean less for the poor? : the politics of tagging;;"Attempts to achieve ""more for the poor"" through the use of indicator targeting may in fact mean less for the poor. The efficient use of a fixed budget for poverty reduction may require targeting. However, the use of indicator targeting, using fixed characteristics that are correlated with poverty to determine the distribution of expenditures, will tend to reduce the budget. Ignoring the budget reducing effects can reduce the welfare of the poor as they receive a greater share of a shrinking budget. There are political economy limits to not only the scope but the form of redistribution.Proposals aimed at improving the welfare of the poor often include indicator targeting, in which non income characteristics (such as race, gender, or land ownership) that are correlated with income are used to target limited funds to groups likely to include a concentration of the poor.Previous work shows that efficient use of a fixed budget for poverty reduction requires such targeting, either because agents' income cannot be observed or to reduce distortionary incentives arising from redistributive interventions.Inspite of this, Gelbach and Pritchett question the political viability of targeting. After constructing a model that is basically an extension of Akerlof's 1978 model of ""tagging,"" they derive three main results:Akerlof's result continues to hold: that, ignoring political considerations, not only will targeting be desirable but recipients of the targeted transfer will receive a greater total transfer than they would if targeting were not possible. A classical social choice analysis --- in which agents vote simultaneously about the level of taxation and the degree of targeting --- shows that positive levels of targeted transfers will not exist in equilibrium (an unsurprising finding, given Plott's 1968 theorem). It also shows that a voting equilibrium often will exist with no targeting but with non zero taxation and redistribution. In a game in which the policy maker chooses the degree of targeting while voters choose the level of taxation, the redistributive efficiency gains from tagging may well fail to outweigh the resulting reduction in funds available for redistribution.These results may be extended readily to account for altruistic agents.Gelbach and Pritchett stress that even when these results hold, the alternative to targeted transfers --- a universally received lump sum grant financed through a proportional tax --- will nonetheless be supported politically and will be quite progressive relative to the pre transfer income distribution.This paper --- a product of the Poverty and Human Resources Division, Policy Research Department --- is part of a larger effort in the department to understand the role of targeting in poverty alleviation efforts.

eldis:A38145;Sustainable forest standards in relation to small timber growers: lessons from KwaZulu Natal;;"This policy paper sets out the relevance of social and environmental standards for small-scale timber growers. It focuses on the development of the National Forest Standards currently being developed by the South African Government . The paper points out that the significance of small-scale timber growers in South Africa is likely to grow: Approximately one third of its timber production in the near future may be derived from small growers.  A key concern for growers is access to markets, especially where growers are not members of out-grower schemes or marketing cooperatives. Nevertheless, the potential for income generation through forestry, despite the risks, is such that there are an ever increasing number of new small growers entering forestry. Key policy conclusions highlighted include: 

    International and national forest standards have the potential to exclude small-scale timber growers from markets, but this outcome is not inevitable 
    small-scale growers should be involved in the process of designing standards to ensure they are not excluded 
    many criteria for sustainable forest management do not make sense at the individual small grower level and it is necessary to identify an appropriate local institutional level at which they can be applied. 
    if small grower communities are to have a realistic chance of meeting standards and thereby contribute to sustainable forest management, direct assistance is required to develop co-operatives and build capacity and appropriate training to increase growers’ awareness of forest standards.

eldis:A27167;Forests in Sustainable Development: guidelines for forest sector development cooperation;;Paper defines a strategy for forest sector development, and translates it for practical application. In response to the causes of deforestation and desertification, which are rooted in a complex web of socio-economic factors (both inside and, mainly, outside the forests) these guidelines are centred on the needs of people living in and making a living from forests. Sustainable forest management is based on economic, environmental, social and cultural criteria and indicators. Forest programmes and projects will not be sustainable if they do not, for example, consider the broader pattern of land use, address questions of land tenure and access to land, find a balance between economic needs and conservation of   biodiversity and give maximum responsibility and benefits to those who live in and make a living from the forests. These objectives cannot be achieved without supporting developing countries in the creation of the necessary policy, legal and  institutional environment.  In support of this approach, the guidelines contain some newly-conceived and innovative elements. With regard to the social  aspect of sustainability, a consistent module for Social Impact Analysis is available. The Commission is now among the first  donors to provide a complete tool box for impact analysis, together with the updated guidelines for Environmental Appraisal in  the forest sector (contained in these guidelines) and the manual on Financial and Economic Analysis of projects.Part I outlines, for a wide audience, the strategic approach of the European Community to Forest Sector Development Co-operation by setting the scene, introducing general principles valid for all types of interventions and defining themes for support to developing countries. It is accompanied by a diskette providing checklists and working materials for use by target  groups.Part II addresses the needs of those dealing directly with EC forest programmes and projects. It provides checklists and support    material within a three-dimensional matrix, combining thematic areas with the phases in the Project Cycle and selected factors for   sustainability. The final parts of Volume II provide standardised Terms of Reference for different studies and detailed guides for Environmental Appraisal, including Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and Social Impact Analysis (SIA).[author] ;;;European Commission Directorate-General for Development;eldis;01/01/1998;en;"development;forestry;sustainable development;land tenure;environment";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";150;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A27167;http://europa.eu.int/comm/development/body/publications/descript/pub6_2_en.cfm;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Feuropa.eu.int%2Fcomm%2Fdevelopment%2Fbody%2Fpublications%2Fdescript%2Fpub6_2_en.cfm;;;;"Statistics and data;Environment;Environmental protection natural resource management;Environment and Forestry;agriculture forestry;development aid;Agriculture and food;Manuals;Agroforestry;Land tenure;forestry;Forest policies and management;Statistics;Development projects;forestry economics"
eldis:A75991;Rethinking the consultation-conflict link: lessons from Bolivia’s gas sector;;"This paper shows that consultations do not only appease conflicts, but also exacerbate them as these procedures are used to negotiate broader grievances. The author further argues that narrow consultations (like those carried out in Bolivia) – rather than comprehensive ones – repress conflicts in the short term by limiting opportunities to mobilize against extractive projects. It also reveals that the degree of conflict and prevention potential of consultations varied according to the affected groups and highlights the ambiguous effects of the entanglement of consultations and compensations.

eldis:A25879;Structural adjustment and the institutional dimensions of agricultural  research and development in Brazil: soybeans, wheat and sugar cane;;Structural adjustment, liberalisation and the pressures of technological change are having major impact on the institutional organisation of the agro-industrial sector. In industrialised countries, the private sector is positioned to play the vanguard role in the next generation of agricultural technologies. Thus, the ability to promote and sustain new patterns of co-operation in research and development between the private and the public sectors will be a key determinant of future patterns of competitiveness. This study of Brazil attempts to identify the main lines of technological and organisational innovation at present under way in important sectors of the Brazilian agricultural research system. It focuses on three crops -- soybeans, wheat and sugar -- which are strategic from the point of view of structural adjustment and liberalisation and at the same time involve both export and domestic markets. ;"John Wilkinson

eldis:A13611;Land reform for poverty redcution? social exclusion and farm workers in Zimbabwe;;This paper represents a provisional attempt to assess whether Zimbabwe’s land reform coherently addresses the issue of poverty reduction. It examines the short-term outcome(s) of the reform programme in relation to its initial objectives. More specifically, it examines its impact on farm-workers.  The majority of farm workers lost jobs in the process as well as access to housing and social services such as health care and schools. Thus the outcome of the programme has been the loss of jobs and livelihoods by farm workers on the one hand, and the acquisition of land as a resource by several hundred thousand small farmers, and black commercial farmers. The paper argues that social exclusion explains the historical and contemporary marginalization of farm workers with profound social consequences for this group. After laying out an analytical framework for the discussion, the paper draws on recently gathered empirical material on farm workers’ incomes, access to basic social services and food security. These aspects have invariably been adversely affected by the land reform process. Applying the concept of “chronic poverty”, the paper considers the conditions of the more vulnerable sections of the farm worker population, the impact of HIV-AIDS on them, and their coping strategies.

eldis:A19411;Exploring ecological and socio-economic issues for the improvement of area enclosure management: a case study from Ethiopia.;;Land degradation is a severe problem across sub-Saharan Africa, and Ethiopia is among the most affected countries. To stop further land degradation, the government of Ethiopia has initiated a number of projects including soil and water conservation works and the establishment of Area Enclosures (AEs) with the financial assistance of international donors, mainly the World Food Program (Betru, 2003). In spite of the impressive results of the ecological rehabilitation and improvements of productivity, many communities have had a bad experience with AEs in the past due to uncertainty and the lack of clarity of land tenure and public land use policy in the country. Due to these uncertainties, the communities did not have decision making power in the management and utilisation of the resources. In addition, they could not use grass and wood produced in the AEs. This study aims to develop guidelines to support the government in developing management plans with a clear land tenure and land use policy for the sustainable management of AEs.

eldis:A14572;Enclosure if the East African rangelands: recent trends and their impact;;This article discusses the enclosure of rangelands and registration of exclusive rights to grazing by individuals or groups of pastoralists. This trend has been increasing greatly over the last twenty years. This occurs because:it is encouraged by governments, planners and multi-lateral donor agencies in an attempt to 'rationalise'the use of rangelands. This arises from a wish to see the pastoral sector move towards more market-oriented production and make a greater overall contribution to the national economyit is initiated by pastoralists as a response to a perception that good land is becoming more secure and there is a need to lay claims to a demarcated area in order to protect grazing rightsThis paper:analyses the reasons why such enclosure is taking placethe short and long term impact on different groupsthe technical and environmental issues which are related to enclosureThe article concludes that:there is much semi-nomadism associated with both planned and spontaneous enclosure, and reciprocal social relations still allow significant access by those excluded to the enclosed areasthe beneficiaries of the enclosures are the national governments which control them and the richer pastoralists who ally themselves with the state and gain power and influence through their increased access to resources. The losers are the poorer pastoralists, pushed further and further into marginal land, and eventually out of pastoralist production completelythis process is an inherently political one, since it concerns questions of access to and control over resourcesit is a growing and important trend with far-reaching implications for the future of nomadic pastoralism ;O.

eldis:A65369;Securing Africa’s land for shared prosperity: a program to scale up reforms and investments;;"Based on worldwide experience and encouraging evidence from country pilots in African countries such as Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania,and Uganda, this new report suggests a series of ten steps that may help to revolutionise agricultural production and eradicate poverty in Africa. These steps include improving tenure security over individual and communal lands, increasing land access and tenure for poor and vulnerable families, resolving land disputes, managing better public land, and increasing efficiency and transparency in land administration services. 
Although poor land governance is daunting, the report argues that the problem is not hopeless. The last decade has witnessed an increase in concerted efforts by African countries and development partners to undertake land policy reforms and to pilot innovative approaches to improve land governance. Many of these countries either have legislation in place or initiatives in progress to address communal land rights and gender equality, the basis for sound land administration. Surges in commodity prices and foreign direct investment have increased the potential return on investment in land administration. It will be necessary to match the evidence in this report with political will and leadership in order to transform African agriculture and Africa’s development prospects. ";F.

eldis:A55628;The links between poverty and the environment in Malawi;;"Deforestation arising from conversion of forest areas into agriculture is a serious problem in Malawi. This paper discusses competition for agricultural land and investigates why the poor are closely associated with forests. Furthermore, the paper examines the effects of changes in crop land use on changes in forest cover. The author notes that the government of Malawi, like many others in sub-Saharan Africa, is currently faced with the problem of poverty. Moreover, being agricultural based most poverty reduction policies are streamlined along the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, some agricultural policies that have been designed to reduce income poverty have on the other hand harmed the environment through deforestation. Thus, an understating of how much cultivation of each crop contributes to how much deforestation is crucial in helping policy makers to come up with policies that can strike a balance between the two. Concerning findings, the document shows that: 

    cultivation of different crops has varying effects on deforestation
    the need to grow cash crops has a negative effect on deforestation
    particularly, cultivation of maize, primarily by the poor, appears to be the principal cause of deforestation while tobacco and pulses stand at second and third positions, respectively
    there is a need to consider adoption of modern farming techniques and technology to ensure that maize farmers are able to produce more output from less land areas
    in addition, there is a need to ensure that property rights and secure ownership are promoted, especially amongst the poor
    this can help local smallholders to consider the issue of reforestation more seriously than is the case today.

Maintenance of Hydropower Potential in Rwanda Through Ecosystem Restoration;;Although it is not possible to state with confidence how climate change may alter precipitation patterns in Rwanda, it is clear that this process will affect the management and generation capacity of its hydroelectric sector in the future. The Government of Rwanda sought to restore the degraded Rugezi-Bulera- Ruhondo watershed by halting on-going drainage activities in the Rugezi Wetlands and banning agricultural and pastoral activities within and along its shores, as well as along the shores of Lakes Bulera and Ruhondo. These response measures, however, also meant that rural households in the region were no longer able to access key resources, adversely affecting the productivity of their livelihoods. Recognizing this, the Government implemented a suite of agricultural and and watershed management measures to offset the initial adverse impacts of their watershed protection policies and render rural livelihoods more sustainable in the longer-term. ;H.

eldis:A14474;Gender and sustainable development in drylands: an analysis of field experiences;;"With an estimated 40 percent of people in Africa, South America and Asia living in drylands, land degradation poses a significant threat to food security and survival. This report looks at the relationship between gender and dryland management based on an analysis of field experiences in Africa and Asia.  Highlighting the roles of women and men in dryland areas for food security, land conservation/desertification, and the conservation of biodiversity, it makes available key findings on a number of projects and programs in the regions. It also outlines different aspects to be considered for achieving sustainable and gender-sensitive dryland management.The report classifies the lessons learned into three main categories: drylands, desertification and poverty; gender roles in drylands; and gender roles in biodiversity and land conservation. Based on the 50 case studies, the lessons include: involving local women and men raising awareness and providing education encouraging conservation through income generation strengthening local institutions promoting sustainability integrating and coordinating projects In order to encourage gender-responsive and sustainable development of drylands, four priorities for immediate gender-responsive action at national and international levels are presented: collection of reliable socio-economic sex- disaggregated data on dryland management activities better understanding of gender roles and how they can be translated into concrete actions in dryland management gender-sensitive analysis and exchange of experiences and good practices to combat desertification and food insecurity actions focussing on the cultural, socio-economic and gender based barriers that prevent men and women from investing in the rehabilitation of agricultural land Associated with these priorities, more specific recommendations suggest that actions in the drylands should consider: sex-disaggregated data on dryland management activities integrated and gender-responsive approaches programmes and projects with a gender perspective gender-sensitive knowledge of the environment, degradation and poverty nexus removing barriers to women’s and men’s efficient management of drylands ";;;Gender and Development, FAO Sustainable Dimensions;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"development;land;sustainable development;land tenure;food security";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"009;KEN;BFA;MAR;ZAF;MLI;CHN;MRT;145;202;015;IND;SEN;SDN;NER;030;034";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14474;ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/005/j0086e/j0086e00.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.fao.org%2Fdocrep%2Ffao%2F005%2Fj0086e%2Fj0086e00.pdf;;;;"Sustainable Development Department;Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Food security;Sustainable livelihoods;Gender roles in agriculture;Food security and gender;Gender;Food security and livelihoods;Soil and land management;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;Environmental policies and management;Participation;Livelihoods gender and food security;pastoralism land rights and tenure;Gender and Population Division;Pastoralism;Agricultural policy"

eldis:A69623;Municipal rates policies and the urban poor;;"In urban areas, the poor struggle to access well located land in cities and legal, institutional and procedural constraints impede secondary residential property markets from functioning effectively in black townships. The purpose of this paper is to examine how municipal property rates policies are, or could be, used as an instrument to promote access by the poor to urban land markets. Buffalo City Municipality and the City of Johannesburg are used as case studies to probe implementation issues and highlight some of the key trade-offs made and approaches taken by municipalities to balance municipal revenue concerns with pro-poor policy intentions.

There are two main avenues by which municipal rates policies could be designed to positively impact on the struggle by low-income households to gain access to urban land. First, by providing direct tax relief, municipal rates policies can impact the demand-side of the equation by making it more affordable to remain in one’s current property or to move up the property ladder. Second, through indirect means, municipal rates policies can create incentives for property owners to make land use decisions which increase the supply of available well-located land and the stock of low-income housing.

Analysis of the municipal property rates policies of the 9 South African Cities Network (SACN) shows that some municipalities limit themselves to the minimum in rebates and exemptions, while others apply more generous and innovative rebates. Cape Town, Nelson Mandela Bay and Ekurhuleni have innovative sliding scale rebates for senior citizens, pensioners and disabled persons with varying numbers of income categories. Linking rates relief to twice the amount of the Old Age Grant is fairly typical, and is an approach adopted by four of the SACN municipalities.

The key difficulty for municipalities in applying rebates to vulnerable groups is that it is difficult to determine who is poor from the information on the valuation roll alone. The rebate process puts the onus on the rate-payer to access the benefit. Hence pro-poor rebates have sound social objectives but are very difficult to implement. Required documents to show eligibility and low levels of public awareness keep take-up rates at minimal levels. Also verification of eligibility information, in the case of rebates for farm workers, often relies solely on the applicants’ self-reporting. As a result, a high number of eligible poor people are therefore not accessing available property tax rebates.

Up to now, National Treasury and the Department have been focused on enabling and monitoring compliance to the MPRA by the deadline; Ensuring that municipalities get new valuation rolls and rates policies in place has been the top priority. However in subsequent phases of implementation of the Act, it will be possible to shift attention to examining the content of those policies, their quality and impact on the poor especially.

This analysis has provided evidence that the lower-middle income band is the hardest hit by property rates: specifically those who earn too much to qualify as indigent but whose property value may exceed the residential exclusion. However the current research is insufficient in providing evidence of how the poor are affected by property rates liabilities: Rates rebates can leave more money in the pocket of poor households, but can they save a family from needing to relocate, or assist a household to move up the property ladder? The general opinion from interviews of municipal officials was that the residential exclusion did not likely affect the property market but further research is needed to test the relationship between the residential exclusion and resale prices in the residential property market.

The paper concluded that effective direct property tax relief measures must a) be narrowly targeted to the poor, b) reach a majority of the eligible population, and c) be cost-effective from the perspective of the municipality which must weigh revenue foregone and administration costs. This analysis has suggested that the residential exclusion is one of the most effective and least costly mechanisms (from an administration perspective) for targeting the poor for rates relief. Better information on collection rates at different income bands and the secondary residential property market in township areas can assist to improve the methodology for setting the residential exclusion threshold, thus improving its pro-poor benefits while respecting municipal revenue needs. Income based rebates and other specific measures to address particular vulnerable groups can then be used to enhance the rates safety net for the poor.

eldis:A27869;Creation of Land Markets in Transition Countries: Implications for the Institutions of Land Administration;;"Describes (1) the processes of privatization of land management in selected transition countries and (2) the post-privatization changes in land administration institutions which are being crafted to establish land markets. It begins with the proposition that there are similar land market institutional problems which most ""transition"" countries are facing, due largely to common experiences in creating command economies during the past 50-80 years and the almost simultaneous decisions of these countries to move toward market political economies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Each country has had unique historical experiences, but this paper proposes that there is enough similar institutional history among the transition countries to venture into comparative analysis. In this regard, the Albanian experience with land market institutional development is presented as being potentially relevant to experiences in other transition countries of  Europe and the former Soviet Union. The broad question is: How can countries construct the institutions of immovable property markets once they have made the political-economic decision to ""go market""? [author] ";D.

eldis:A17650;Private and communal land tenure in Morocco's western High Atlas mountains: complements, not ideological opposites;;In Morocco's Western High Atlas Mountains, Berber agropastoralists are oblivious to the ideological debate over land tenure occurring in the rangeland development community. Berber producers of sheep and goats use a continuum of tenure institutions, from private ownership, to communal control, to uncontrolled, open range. Far from being ideological opposites, these different types of land tenure are complementary tools. This complementarity contradicts the neat ideological lines drawn between pro- and anti-commons schools of thought in the range development community.The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it reviews briefly the current controversy over land tenure in the range development community. Then, arguing against a popularized paradigm that proposes that private tenure of scarce resources is necessarily more efficient than communal control, it presents a case study of forage-land tenure in a High Atlas valley. Using examples of tenure in this valley, I argue retroductively in favour of a more comprehensive paradigm of rangeland tenure that considers both benefits and costs as factors of the appropriateness of private or communal tenure. ;L.

eldis:A71497;The overlooked role of elites in African grassroots conflicts: A case study of the Dinka-Mundari-Bari conflict in Southern Sudan;;"Many analysts of grassroots conflicts in African emphasized one of the following factors to be the most important: ethnic divisions, competition over resources or competition between pastoralists and agriculturalists. The role of elites has been down played in such conflicts. This argument is being challenged by current evidence as shown by the Dinka-Mundari-Bari Conflict in Juba County in Southern Sudan. The data for this paper is derived mainly from a longitudinal study dating back to 1972 using observation and interviews as the main methods of data collection. Other sources of data included historical and recent reports of conflicts in the area. The major findings of the study are that: While low-keyed conflicts between the Dinka-Bor and the Bari-Speaking group existed in the past over the ownership and use of natural resources, they have been transformed into violent political conflicts over the years. The fragmentation of centers of political power, the divide-and-rule strategy of the Central Government, and the divisions between the elites of the two ethnic groups, who weakened local administrative structures and traditional mechanisms in conflict management and resolution, have sharpened the ethnic differences and competition over resources. The manipulation of ethnic differences by opposing groups in the various civil wars in Sudan and by the elites at the centers of political power is the main cause of transforming traditional competition over natural resources into violent conflicts.

eldis:A70337;Consultative conference on peace agreements and conflict minerals in the DRC;;"Thess proceedings are the result of a conference hald in Kinshasa, 2013, to discuss the impact of key peace agreements and the trade in conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Representatives from Congolese academia, civil society, government agencies and political parties reflected on the different peace agreements and conflict minerals in general and the potential impact of the latest Framework Agreement on Peace and Security in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region signed in Addis Ababa in particular. The conference also discused United Nations Security Council Resolution 2098, which established a rapid intervention brigade. The consensus that emerged during the discussions was that to finally end the conflicts engulfing the DRC, it was necessary to first end illegal mining and the illicit trade in minerals, which were fuelling the violence.

eldis:A18999;Land tenure systems and their impacts on food security and sustainable development in Africa;;Recent food security crises in Africa have revived the debate on whether current land tenure systems constrain farmer innovation and investment in agriculture. Both direct and indirect linkages between land tenure and food security have been suggested. This study aims for a better understanding of these linkages. Specifically it aims:to improve the current understanding of the linkages between land tenure systems, food security and sustainable natural resource management in Africato assess the current land tenure policy reforms in selected African countriesto draw lessons based on best practices as well as failures of ongoing and past policiesto make policy recommendations to assist States in addressing issues of land reform implementation and hence improve their food security situation and the stewardship of natural resources.The paper suggests that land is central in promoting rural livelihoods in Africa. Access to land and security of tenure are the main means through which food security and sustainable development can be realised because the livelihoods of over 70% of the population in Africa are primarily linked to land and natural resources exploitation.The paper presents a number of models developed to explore the complex linkages between different types of tenure. The authors develop their view that with some local variation, the legacy of colonial land policies in Africa has led to existing forms of customary land tenure being either ignored, overridden or reformulated for the convenience of the colonising power. These then create  new and artificial class and ethnic divisions amongst the indigenous populations. They conclude that it is the resultant dual, unequal and hierarchical system of land tenure that present land reform initiatives seek to redress. However those reforms that have been implemented have largely been inadequate and have been fraught with tensions between user groups and different land-uses.Other findings include: unequal land distribution is closely linked to poor utilisation of land which in turn is linked to food insecurity and conflicttenure insecurity arises from rapid socioeconomic change disrupting customary institutions and from excessive government interference in customary tenure systems. It is pervasive among women under all tenure systemsrapid population growth remains a key trigger of the chain of environmental problems and de-facto tenure changes, development of (illegal) land markets, increasing encroachment of agricultural activity into marginal areas and the high incidence of conflicts over land and other natural resourceswhere security of tenure is weak in general, livelihoods can be constrained. Thus tenure remains key for improving land management practicesrecent land tenure policy reforms that have been developed from more participatory processes, are more comprehensive in scope, and have generally affirmed more rights for individual citizens and fewer rights for the Statein land distribution reforms, market assisted redistribution and preventative restrictions on land market transactions have not worked well. Taxation can be effective but must be part of a broader land distribution programmeThe study findings were presented as a background paper to an expert group meeting held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in April 2003, and the final paper has been revised according to the recommendations of this group. ;;;UN Economic Commission for Africa ;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"development;land;sustainable development;land tenure;land distribution;food security;rural development;land registration;land tenure systems;land ownership";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A18999;http://www.uneca.org/eca_resources/Publications/sdd/Land_Tenure_systems.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uneca.org%2Feca_resources%2FPublications%2Fsdd%2FLand_Tenure_systems.pdf;;;;"Food security;Agriculture and food;rural development;Land registration;Food security and livelihoods;land;sustainable livelihoods;Land tenure;rural livelihoods;Land distribution;Livelihoods agricultural assets;Rural development;tenure;Communal land;land ownership"

The aim is to understand the challenges Indian cities face as well as the opportunities available to them to adopt transformative urban processes that can foster inclusive economic growth that is also low-carbon. The paper explores the role of (urban) energy, multimodal transport, smart infrastructure, green buildings, water and urban finance to explore how and to what extent states are able to balance economic growth, urbanisation and carbon emissions. The paper argues that pathways of urbanization that can help India achieve its carbon commitments without compromising on growth are possible and identifies four core policy pillars for a new growth model for Indian cities.

eldis:A27867;Regulatory policies and reform: the case of land markets;;"Chapter list in HTML, chapters are in PDF formatAlthough recent analyses of land markets show a growing concern for policy and regulatory issues, the literature still            lacks a robust framework capable of showing how land markets function, the major policy and regulatory constraints to their efficient operations, and the implications for reform.This chapter is a step in that direction. The first section sets out to characterize land markets -- their emergence, closely  associated with the evolution of property rights; major imperfections; and key spatial aspects. The focus of the second section is on policies that affect how land markets operate, both directly (such as tenure security, zoning laws, prohibitions of land transactions, speculation, rent controls, and land taxation) and indirectly (such as credit policies   and tax and tariff policies). The third section describes the fundamentals of regulatory policy reform in land markets and        suggests a two-phase process. In the first, regulations that are inconsistent with efficient outcomes or that drive inequitable results should be eliminated. In the second phase, a new legal and institutional framework for land administration would be created. The land administration unit should be a technical unit that collects and provides (for a  fee) information to the public on relevant aspects of land markets and performs all functions related to titling and conflict  resolution. The final section suggests areas for future policy research. [author] ";"S.P. Brandão

eldis:A43174;Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in Indonesia;;"This paper summarises a study undertaken by the Indonesian Forest Climate Alliance (IFCA) to support Indonesian stakeholders to participate in global negotiations. The authors note that the objective of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) payment distribution mechanisms is to support policies and measures that reduce deforestation and degradation through transfer of revenues from international REDD funds or carbon markets to national levels. This may provide benefits of: shared responsibility for reducing a major driver of global climate change; financial payments and co-investment that exceed the economic opportunities foregone from decisions to maintain carbon stocks; and co-benefits through the other environmental service functions that well-maintained forests can provide. Two types of financial transfers have so far been proposed to provide incentives for REDD: the creation of a separate REDD fund with a mandate to target emission reductions in forested countries, and the creation of tradable rights to emit. They further note that overcapacity in the pulp and paper sector and the lack of clarity on the legal status of forests across Indonesia is accompanied by unresolved claims between the state and local communities. The authors find out that existing funding and incentive schemes in Indonesia are subject to risks due to lack of transparency and accountability and high corruption.A number of recommendations are noted, which include:

    support clear property rights and rules on benefits, responsibilities and sanctions at the local level
    existing institutions will need to be reconstructed and strengthened to make a change and reduce emissions 
    provide efficiency as well as fairness. Focus on the areas, drivers and sectors that are currently most directly linked to emissions from deforestation and forest/peatland degradation, and provide appropriate incentives to areas, drivers and sectors that actively contribute to resource conservation, and provide new options to those at a cross-roads of alternative development pathways
    develop and operationalise a vision of a long term transition to sustainability that meets the Millennium Development Goals and respects the rights of forest and agroforest communities
    improve the transparency and accountability of governance systems that link the local to the national scale
    enhance the REDDiness of local and national stakeholders by creating active learning on what emission reduction with effective feedback systems is about. Enhance awareness, develop local monitoring skills, and support local creativity in finding effective solutions through appropriate incentive systems.

eldis:A61709;Climate change, water and food security;;"This report summarises current knowledge of the anticipated impacts of climate change on water availability for agriculture. It examines the implications for local and national food security and the methods and approaches for assessing climate change impacts on water and agriculture. It emphasises the need for a closer alignment between water and agricultural policies and makes the case for immediate implementation of ‘no-regrets’ strategies which have both positive development outcomes and make agricultural systems resilient to future impacts.The report makes the following recommendations to help develop practical adaptation and mitigation strategies for agricultural water management in developing countries.

    Ensure better prediction of the impacts on agricultural systems in closely specified regions and production systems using the typology and decision analysis outlined in the publication.
    Provide assistance in developing and applying downscaling techniques to better analyse agroclimatic futures and build local capacity for climate modelling and adaptation.
    Conduct targeted analysis of the investment needs for different solutions, which take into account long-term embodied and operational energy use for all agricultural impact and adaptation studies, and sit at a higher strategic level than work on irrigation and water use in agriculture.

In tandem with the above activities:

    it is necessary to expand the density, detail and frequency of monitoring of climatic and hydrologic systems in order to confirm the evolution of trends and modelled predictions, refine the assessment of impacts, and manage adaptive strategies accordingly
    improved information on the nature and dynamics of key production systems is required
    it will be necessary to evaluate, document and disseminate good practice at farm, system and strategic levels
    it is important to tease out the environmental consequences, options and trade-offs involved in both meeting future agricultural demands and accommodating climate change. 

In conclusion, the paper focuses on action needed to assist developing countries to assess probable climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture, food production and in adapting agricultural water management to cope with the range of anticipated impacts. ";"H. Turral

eldis:A74351;A new paradigm for Caribbean development: transitioning to a green economy ;;"This objective of this study is to augment the regional and international dialogue on the Green Economy in the context of inclusive and sustainable development. It sets out a path to transition to a greener economy with a sector-approach.

Much of the interest in green economy, in the Caribbean, as elsewhere, revolves around its implications for the energy sector. Most Caribbean countries clearly want to reduce dependence on fossil fuels through the development of indigenous alternative sources that are more sustainable with significant emphasis on renewable energy and energy efficiency within broader strategies to green key sectors. For example, policymakers in the Region are looking for concrete advice and direction with respect to renewable energy for electricity generation. They need economic data on the costs and benefits of switching to renewable energy, including information on the potential for significant foreign exchange savings, revenue impacts, employment generation and environmental impacts.

eldis:A24566;Turning treasure into tears: mining, dams and deforestation in Shwegyin township, Pegu Division, Burma;;This report addresses the environmental and human rights situation faced by villagers and migrant workers in Shwegyin township of Nyaunglebin District, Pegu Division, Burma. Specifically, it examines the area around the Shwegyin and Mawtama Rivers where the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) and its business partners are engaged in building a dam, mining for gold, and logging the forests.The report highlights how heavy militarisation of the region, the indiscriminate granting of mining and logging concessions, and the construction of the Kyauk Naga Dam have led to forced labour, land confiscation, extortion, forced relocation, and the destruction of the natural environment. The human consequences of these practices have been social unrest, increased financial hardship, and great personal suffering for the victims of human rights abuses.The report makes numerous recommendations to the State Peace and Development Council on human rights, the environment, and mining which include:to make changes to the 1974 Constitution so that civilians have more rights over the land they occupy, including rights to obtain legal land titleto provide sufficient food, salaries, and other material supplies to its soldiers and officers so that they are self-sufficient in the field and do not need to live off the populationto replace outdated laws and replace ineffective environmental provisions to bring them into accordance with its 1994 Environmental Policy and the UN-supported national action plan for the environment known as “Myanmar Agenda 21”to strengthen the National Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA) by empowering it to enforce existing laws and other regulations regarding environmental issues to ban and take immediate legal action against individuals and companies using ecologically damaging techniques.The report also makes recommendations for international governments, international organisations and NGOs, the private sector and opposition groups. ;C.

eldis:A75611;No Man’s Lands? Extractive activity, territory, and scial unrest in the Peruvian Amazon: the Cenepa river ;;"This case study shows how the activities of a large foreign-invested mining company on land held by the Awajun community in the northern forests of Peru have led to a characteristic cycle of state permissiveness in granting mining concessions, thus leading to social conflict.

It describes encounters between the company and the indigenous community who, though lacking land title, have protected their rights by demanding that their territory be declared a national park. It analyses Peru’s legal and institutional frameworks, and shows how successive governments have deemed the Amazon an ""empty"" territory to be exploited in order to bring ""progress"". It documents the emergence of this particular conflict, which has gradually escalated in severity, and argues that the temporary equilibrium that currently exists can only be sustained if all the actors involved recognise the common ownership of the lands in question.

eldis:A66088;Improving environmental management of extractives through Environmental Impact Assessments ;;"How have Latin American countries been using Environmental Impact Assessments in order to build more sustainable extractive industries? A focus on Peru provides some interesting lessons.

Is it possible to develop extractive industries while preserving the environment? Several Latin American countries have been attempting to improve the environmental sustainability of their extractive industry sectors by developing their legal frameworks, in particular through the use and adaptation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) tool.

This Brief focuses primarily on experiences in Peru, where integration of the EIA into extractive industry policy has been extensive.  The Brief focuses on three particularly noteworthy innovations implemented in Peru: mine closure plans; regulation and approval mechanisms; and citizen participation.  Overall, the Brief aims to offer an understanding of the advances, challenges and debates around the implementation of EIAs when seeking a balance between environmental sustainability and extractive sector development. The lessons drawn from Peru and other Latin American countries may be useful for other regions struggling to balance extractive industry development with environmentally sustainable approaches to land use.

Key Lessons:


	incorporating the EIA into environmental management policies can help countries to build more sustainable extractive industry sectors
	closure plans represent one mechanism being used to strengthen environmental management by committing private investors to mitigate the long-term environmental impacts that typically undermined the sustainability of extractive projects
	EIA processes should be closely regulated by the state, but independently evaluated in order to improve transparency and legitimacy

eldis:A23862;Does oil corrupt?: evidence from a natural experiment in West Africa;;This paper is an attempt to deepen knowledge on the relationships between natural resources and corruption. Specifically, the paper attempts to understand whether there is a causal relationship from natural resource abundance to corruption. The paper analyses the case of São Tomé and Príncipe. The paper looks at the effects of the announcements of a significant oil discovery in the period 1997-1999 and whether that translates into increased corruption efforts.The study conducted household surveys on perceived corruption in the public services/sector. The paper finds that an increase in perceived corruption has occurred in São Tomé and Príncipe in recent years, ranging from 21% to 38% of the subjective scale. Specifically, clear changes in several sectors where public rents are perceived to increase corruption. The most robust sectors include: vote buying, education, and state jobs. ;P.

eldis:A30094;Agrarian Reform in Uzbekistan and Other Central Asian Countries;;"The five Central Asian countries that gained their independence at the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 have followed different paths of transition to a market economy in the agricultural sector. Kyrgyzstan has been the most aggressive in restructuring agricultural enterprises, privatizing land, and promoting individual farming. Kazakstan and Turkmenistan have had similar legal and policy reforms, but implementation has lagged. Tajikistan's efforts
at reform have been hampered by civil strife and continued weakness of government. Uzbekistan, in contrast to the others, has attempted to control its progress towards market-oriented agriculture very closely, with the result that the agrarian sector looks on the surface very similar today to what it looked like
in 1991.After a brief discussion of the similarities and differences among the Central Asian countries, this essay explores the results of Uzbekistan's choice to proceed ""step by step,"" as the government says, by examining the country's characteristics of agrarian structure, agricultural production, and policy concerns.

eldis:A30093;Challenging conventional wisdom: smallholder perceptions of land access and tenure security in the Cotton Belt of Mozambique;;"A new land law went into effect in January 1998 in Mozambique. The impetus behind these actions was the belief that a new legal and regulatory framework was necessary to reduce the frequency of land conflicts between largeholders and smallholders while simultaneously promoting much-needed investment in the agricultural sector.With empirical evidence presented in this report, based on smallholder survey data collected from 1994 to 1996, the authors challenge widely held beliefs about land tenure and access in the smallholder sector in Mozambique. Although the new land law may improve tenure security for smallholders who experience conflicts with largeholders, two key areas of policy concern have been neglectedwhile provisions in the new legal framework to safeguard local community land-use rights vis-à-vis outsiders are important, they will not be sufficient to eliminate and/or adjudicate land conflicts between smallholders themselves while much attention has been devoted to the legal and regulatory component of land tenure in Mozambique, research results reveal significant variation in the size of household landholdings even when controlling for household size. Further, land access was found to be closely linked to key welfare indicators such as income and calorie availability; a weak nonfarm economy heightens the importance of land for the welfare of rural families. These results are surprising and contradict views held by many in the policy community in Mozambique that land access is unconstrained for smallholders. ";"P.J. Strasberg

The article stresses that establishing protected areas (national parks together with wildlife sanctuaries) in  North Thailand did not reduce the likelihood of forest clearing, but wildlife sanctuaries may have reduced the probability of deforestation. Where new roads are located affects how much of a threat they are to protected areas.The article found that road building, by reducing the impedance-weighted distance to market, has promoted clearing, especially near the forest fringe. The authors simulate the impact of further road building to show where road building is likely to have the greatest impact on forest clearing and where it is likely to threaten protected areas. ;"M.

However, this can lead to trade-offs with other sustainability objectives. This policy brief outlines key issues relating to biodiversity and the development of the hydropower sector in Vietnam. It is aimed at informing policymakers, civil society and donors. It argues that the large-scale development of the country’s hydropower sector is being undertaken without due consideration of the impacts that this is having on the nation’s biodiversity. Environmental services from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are crucial to the livelihoods of many of the country’s poorer communities; sustainable development requires that environmental assets are properly valued and accounted for. The brief concludes by asserting that policymakers must undertake proper environmental assessments in order to arrive at a strategically planned energy mix that is sustainable in the long-term.

eldis:A18197;Land problems in Nakivale settlement and the implications for refugee protection in Uganda;;"Ugandan refugee policy is characterised by the encampment of refugees in designated and enclosed settlements in rural areas, removed from the mainstream economic and political activity of the country. Families are given small parcels of land and are expected to become progressively more self-sufficient, finally reaching a point where they no longer require food rations and other humanitarian assistance.This report focuses on the land crisis in the Nakivale refugee settlement in south-western Uganda, analysing the ways in which conflict over land has made refugee protection and self-sufficiency difficult to achieve. It draws on interviews conducted in 2002 with both refugees and Ugandan nationals.The report’s findings include that:while land given to refugees often appeared to be empty and bushy, it often turned out that it had previously been used by local pastoralists to graze their cattle, leading to resentment amongst the pastoralist communitiesUgandan agriculturalists lacked security of tenure and could be evicted at any time to provide land for refugeesrefugees were, however, seen as providing a good source of cheap labour and a market for agricultural produce; it appeared that if the land problem could be ameliorated then the tensions around the settlement would be greatly reducedethnic tensions were beginning to surface both within refugee populations (which included Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus) and between refugees and Ugandan nationalsgovernment steps such as a task force set up to investigate claims of land ownership, failed to include representatives from refugee or local communities and suggested solutions which were too simplistic and narrow to address the complex problems.In the light of these findings, the report recommends that:land redistribution should not be influenced by the aim of keeping refugees and nationals apart; refugee protection and self reliance require both good social and economic relationships between nationals and refugees, and sound refugee policies that promote free individual interaction between refugees and their hostsfuture initiatives should allow for greater involvement of refugees and nationals in resolving the current impassein the longer term, the government should consider dispersing refugees, rather than maintaining them within limited areas of the countrythe government should encourage other means of self-sufficiency for refugees that do not entirely depend on land, in order to reduce the pressure on land in areas such as Nakivale.

eldis:A44130;Impacts of land certification on tenure security, investment, and land market participation: evidence from Ethiopia;;While early attempts at land titling in Africa were unsuccessful, factors such as new legislation, low-cost methods, and increasing demand for land have generated renewed interest. This paper aims to assess the impacts of land registration in Ethiopia. The paper was motivated particularly by the fact that evidence on the impact of specific interventions is lacking so that it is unclear whether land tenure should be of greater concern to policy makers.The paper finds that certification has resulted in a significant reduction of tenure insecurity and an increase in land-related investment and supply to the land rental market. Although tenure insecurity decreased markedly due to certification, it remains large, pointing to the need for complementary action on the policy front if the full potential of this intervention is to be realised. The paper indicates that if the voluntary investments made following certification are maintained, or if additional investment is forthcoming in the future, benefits exceed certification cost. Furthermore, the cost of maintaining the land administration system will not be a major constraint to its sustainability in the long term. The paper concludes that in situations where improper circumstances pose a threat to tenure security, a community-based process to certify and register rights may be economically and socially beneficial. The process can be done by securing existing rights and allowing right holders to individually or collectively take decisions on how to use such rights. The paper stresses the need for follow-up research to explore the extent to which benefits from land certification are affected by the policy environment on the long run, as well as their distribution and longer-term trajectory. ;"K.

eldis:A43472;A golden opportunity?: how Tanzania is failing to benefit from gold mining;;"This report analyses how Tanzania is failing to use its considerable mineral resources to tackle poverty, and asks: where is Tanzania’s mineral wealth going?  Gold mining is the fastest growing sector of Tanzania’s economy. Minerals now account for nearly half the country’s exports and Tanzania is Africa’s third largest gold producer. Yet ordinary Tanzanians are not benefi ting from this boom both because the government has implemented tax laws that are overly favourable to multinational mining companies and because of the practices of these companies.This report identifies three severe problems, namely:

    the government is receiving very low tax revenues from gold mining 
    gold mining is subject to minimal governmental or popular democratic scrutiny and is widely perceived to suffer from the associated problem of corruption
    people in the gold mining areas are failing to significantly benefit, and many are being made poorer.

The authors argue that major policy changes are needed, including:

    Tanzania’s mining law should be amended to ensure that the national economy, and Tanzanians, benefit much more from gold mining. No new mining contracts should be signed until this reform has taken place
    large donors, such as the British government and the World Bank, must champion this agenda. This will require pressure and monitoring from civil society organisations in Tanzania and internationally
    existing mining contracts must be made public and subject to parliamentary scrutiny
    all the gold mining companies and the government should be required by law to make a full public declaration of how much they pay and receive in tax and other remittances from gold mining
    Tanzania should join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
    mining contracts must include specific provisions for consultation with local communities. This will require a change in attitude by central government which fears a loss of control over the mining contracts.

eldis:A69933;Under What Circumstances and Conditions Does Adoption of Technology Result in Increased Agricultural Productivity? A Systematic Review ;;"New technology that enables sustainable and profitable production of food and fibre is critical for both food security and economic development. Whether framed in terms of modernisation, productivity enhancement, poverty reduction, social protection, environmental protection or adaptation to climate change, technical change is at the heart of most agricultural policy, programmes and projects. From a development perspective, a nagging question is why the benefits of new agricultural technology often appear to by-pass poorer farmers – even when they are the ‘target’ group.

Our review focuses on technology for food crop production in low and lower middle income countries (LLMIC) and the productivity gains farmers achieve when adopting them. It is also concerned with other impacts, positive and negative, that may accrue, for example with respect to health, food security or environmental services. Both individually and collectively managed technologies are considered.

This review is directed to an audience of policy-makers and practitioners in the agricultural research area and to development studies academics. It has two main objectives:


	Providing policy makers and practitioners a more realistic understanding of the outcomes that can be expected from technological change as well as of the opportunities to shape the innovation environment so as to favour a productive agriculture supporting broad-based livelihoods;
	Informing the academic community on key gaps in evidence and on the evolution of theory and its drivers in this field.


This appears to be the first systematic review of the conditions and circumstances under which productivity gains are achieved from the adoption of agricultural technology, either globally or by region.

eldis:A101589;Civil society’s role in shaping Zimbabwe’s diamond governance;;Zimbabwe confirmed that alluvial diamonds had been discovered in the Marange area in Mutare District in 2006. However, as in many otherAfrican countries, the promise diamond mining holds for economic growth has been eroded by a lack of transparency and accountability. The country’s diamond sector has been bedevilled by smuggling, opaque licensing, human rights abuses, self-enrichment by executives and public officials, and extremely limited accrual of diamond revenues to the fiscus, among others. Civil society monitoring and lobbying at local, national and international levels has played a critical role in improving the governance of Zimbabwe’s diamond sector. This briefing highlights the actions civil society has taken to promote transparency and accountability in Zimbabwe’s diamond sector. It concludes that civil society has contributed significantly towards better diamond sector governance in Zimbabwe in the last 10 years. It has also helped to broaden the view of what constitute conflict diamonds among international bodies such as the Kimberley Process (KP) Certification Scheme, the World Diamond Council (WDC) and the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB). ;J.

eldis:A71791;Land governance in Brazil: a geo-historical review ;;"This paper examines the paradoxes of land governance in Brazil by putting them in their historical context, highlighting in particular the continuing subordination of peasant farmers’ interests to those of large landholders. It traces the development of the country’s regional divisions and systems of land-holding back to colonial times, when Portuguese settlers began carving up the territory. It describes the emergence of large-scale plantation agriculture producing commodities for export, and the evolution of the latifundios into today’s transnational agribusiness monocultures, which are swallowing up more and more land. Despite various changes of government and sporadic attempts at land reform over the years, large-scale agrarian capitalism has generally enjoyed the support of Brazil’s political classes, to the detriment of small-scale peasant farmers, indigenous peoples, and others who, despite producing much of the country’s food, are being increasingly marginalised and deprived of their land and traditional ways of life.

The paper looks in detail at this phenomenon in each of Brazil’s regions and also examines trends such as land grabbing by foreign interests, the growing demand for agrofuels, rural-urban migration, and impacts on the environment. Throughout, it poses the essential question: how can Brazil’s vast territory be governed to meet the interests of all, and not just a privileged few?

eldis:A22309;Agrarian reform in the context of food sovereignty, the right to food and cultural diversity: “land, territory and dignity”;;Through an analysis of the right to adequate food and the right to land, this civil society report, argued that achieving food sovereignty requires agrarian reform. The paper therefore calls for a new redistributive land reform that recognises indigenous territories and respects and balances the needs of diverse rural peoples.Highlighting territory as a more inclusive and important concept than just land, the authors emphasise that redistributive land reform in the context of food sovereignty must be designed through processes in which local communities take leadership, and which address the needs and demands of diverse groups. The paper defines the policies required for agrarian reform and rural development to truly contribute to poverty reduction, environmental protection, and the enhancement of broad based economic growth, and also explains the fundamental pillars of food sovereignty.Arguing for an original and genuine agrarian reform, backed by the right to adequate food and  food sovereignty, the paper suggests that the following might be useful guidelines for achieving this:internationally recognised legal instruments support calls for genuine agrarian reform, food sovereignty, and the rights to territory and self determinationwhen families receive land they must not be saddled with heavy debt burdenssecure tenure and/or access rights are critical to ensuring long term food security for families and communities. Without this, it is difficult to invest in land improvement, means of production, and conservation measureswomen must have the right to hold title to landredistributed land must be of good quality, rather than ecologically fragile soils which should never be farmed, and it must be free of disputed claims by other poor peoplethe rights of indigenous and other peoples to land and common property resources must be guaranteed and protected, as must their right to manage them using customary law and traditionthere must be a supportive policy environment and essential services like credit on reasonable terms, infrastructure, support for ecologically sound technologies, and access to markets and fair pricesdamaging free trade policies and dumping should be replaced by a food sovereignty perspective which places the highest priority on national production for national marketsthe power of rural elites must be effectively broken by the reformsthe vast majority of the rural poor must be beneficiaries of the reform processsuccessful reforms are distinguished from failed ones by a motivation that new small family farms are the centerpiece of economic development, rather than a 'welfare' mechanismstrong grassroots movements are critical to pushing the reform process. ;;;International NGO/CSO Planning Committee ;eldis;01/01/2006;en;"food security;land registration;land distribution;land;indigenous peoples;territory;land tenure;agrarian reform";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A22309;http://www.icarrd.org/en/icard_doc_down/Issue_Paper5.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icarrd.org%2Fen%2Ficard_doc_down%2FIssue_Paper5.pdf;;;;"Food security;land tenure;Agriculture and food;food sovereignty;Land registration;Land tenure;Land distribution;indigenous peoples;Food policy;Right to food;territory;Communal land;agrarian reform"
eldis:A42069;Livelihoods, power and choice: the vulnerability of the Northern Rizaygat, Darfur, Sudan;;"Livelihoods in Darfur are intimately linked to the conflict. This document considers the livelihoods of the Northern Rizaygat, a group of Arabic-speaking, camel-herding nomads living in the Sudanese states of North, South, and West Darfur. The Northern Rizaygat have achieved notoriety for their role in the Janjaweed, the loose groupings of armed Arab tribesmen, who, since 2003, have been integral players in Darfur’s conflict and instrumental to the Sudanese government’s counterinsurgency campaign. The authors of this document use a livelihoods lens to illustrate the processes that shaped the vulnerability of the Northern Rizaygat, and brought them to the point where they were willing to actively support the counterinsurgency against the Darfuri rebels. The authors argue that lessons learned from this specific case have broader implications not only for prospects of peace and recovery in Darfur, but also for policies around pastoralism, land tenure security, climate adaptation, natural resource management, and humanitarian intervention. The document provides a background on the Northern Rizaygat. The authors argue that it was the particular vulnerability of the Northern Rizaygat’s livelihoods that drove them to actively join the government’s counterinsurgency strategy in 2004. The document argues that people should not be distracted by spurious notions of ethnicity, disparaging attitudes towards nomads, and demonization of the Northern Rizaygat for becoming embroiled in a conflict not of their making. The following recommendations are given: 

    a field-based participatory policy review of pastoralism is needed 
    there is a need for a comprehensive advocacy strategy on camel pastoralism and the Arab Aballa 
    localization of the peace process and strengthening linkages is required from the local to the higher-level peace processes 
    human and social development should be adapted to pastoralist livelihoods 
    a new generation of leadership should be encouraged which articulates development needs in the context of pastoralism.

A case study of two communities in Huambo province;;A new Land Act introduced in Angola in 2004 demonstrates a genuine interest in the protection of the customary land rights of rural communities and underlines rural communities’ rights to their land. However, the documentation of customary rights in Angolan agriculture is limited. This report describes and analyses customary land rights in two villages in Huambo province, both situated some 60 to 90 km from the provincial capital. The report demonstrates that despite of many similarities there exist huge differences in agricultural practices and in how customary land rights are conceived. In Cambembua land utilization is more intensive and production mainly aims the urban markets, while agriculture in Mombolo is more extensive and subsistence oriented. In Cambembua most of the land is acquired through special forms of sales while bilateral inheritance remains the common practice in Mombolo. [Abstract from CMI website] ;"E. Jul-Larsen

Using balanced panel data for 309 households in 2001, 2003, and 2005, models that control for unobserved household heterogeneity and endogeneity of land acquisition and disposition are employed to measure the poverty-reduction effect of land on household expenditure per adult equivalent. Significant poverty reduction effects of increased land access in form of owned, operated and market-accessed land were found. The poverty reduction effect for land accessed through the market was significantly larger than the poverty reduction effect of land accessed through inheritance. ;"A. Tatwangire

Border conflicts were more common near district centers, further away from markets, and where property rights had been redistributed more recently. A higher probability of reduction in conflicts during and after the reform was positively associated with nearness to markets, longer distance to district centers, more recent land redistribution, better quality border demarcation and plot measurement during registration, and less involvement by local elders in adjudication. ;"S.T.

eldis:A72685;The Role of Policy in Facilitating Adoption of Climate-Smart Agriculture in Uganda;;"This study aims at understanding the influence of policy frameworks on climate change adaptation in Uganda. It combines literature review on existing natural resource management policies, focus group discussions with farming communities and interviews with key informants across various policy implementation levels. Findings reveal that even when farmers are exposed to appropriate adaptation practices, adoption is still constrained by limited enforcement of policies and regulations. Various reasons constrain enforcement; policies are formulated through top–down approaches, NGOs and local governments are minimally involved while local communities are largely excluded. There is either lack of or existence of non-functional implementation structures prescribed by the policies. Coupled with unclear roles among actors, weak links between different administration levels, limited human and financial resources and political interference, the ability of smallholders to adopt climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is thus constrained. Due to lack of knowledge of what the policies provide for, smallholders are not able to demand their rights. There is need for more focused follow-up research on specific issues raised in this report.

eldis:A59153;Caste discrimination, land reforms and land market performance in Nepal;;The caste system is an intricate part of the institutional structure as well as class formation, political instability and conflicts in Nepal. The most severely discriminated group in the caste system is the Dalits, the so-called “untouchables”. Dalits faced religious, occupational and even, territorial discrimination. They were traditionally excluded from receiving education, using public resources, and had no rights to own land. The situation of Dalits especially before 1951 can best be explained by a patron-client dependency in which landed patrons (high-caste households) provided them with access to small pieces of land and other basic requirements for subsistence living and in return to that, they are bound to provide their services to their patron. Although caste discrimination is outlawed now, it still has impacts on their lives because it restricts their access to economic resources. ;"J.P. Aryal and Stein T. Holden

It has also avoided the violent conflicts and political instability that have characterised most of its closest neighbours in the last decades of the 20th century. However, as with almost all other countries considered to have good track records on human rights, the situation of indigenous peoples stands out as a major blemish.

This is especially the case when the complex of rights that are interdependent with indigenous peoples’ territorial rights is considered. This article details the history, legal background and current status of this situation in Costa Rica as well as the relevant international human rights law. Particular attention is paid to the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

eldis:A27697;Peasant Cotton Cultivation and Marketing Behaviour in Tanzania since Liberalisation;;Discusses the debate around structural adjustment and African  agriculture, the history of the Tanzanian cotton sector and farming systems in the main cotton growing area of the country before reporting the results of a small survey of cultivators carried out at the end of the 1997/8 seed cotton marketing season. This survey, carried out in the fourth year of market liberalisation, covered         crop sales, farming methods, marketing behaviour and perceptions of the marketing system. The survey’s main findings were as follows:while there was almost certainly a substantial production response in 1995/6 over 1994/5 (for both official production statistics and survey data reported here on shares of cultivated area under cotton in 1995/6 show a big increase on comparable         material for 1994), there is no evidence that this response has been subsequently amplified as liberalisation has continued and as monetisation of cotton sales has been institutionalised. Neither official production statistics nor average shares of cultivated area under cotton or average cotton sales as reported here show an         increase over the period 1995/6 to 1997/8. In fact they show a decline of production and sales in 1997/8. while the decline in 1997/8 was mainly the result of adverse weather conditions, the underlying failure for production to grow is based on a failure to      shift toward more optimal farming methods, and a significant decline in non-labour input use. The latter follows a monetisation of inputs supply. It remains to be seen if input use will also flatten out as this monetisation process becomes institutionalised. In any event, a recovery in input use seems unlikely. primary cooperative societies are currently retaining very sizeable seed        cotton market shares, despite offering inferior prices to private traders’ ones and despite having curtailed the supply of inputs on favourable terms. This is partly  based on their retention of effective monopolies in certain geographical areas. But they are also surviving in areas of high competition on the basis of the loyalty of a segment of the peasantry. Their ability to retain market share seems likely to weaken as the years pass, since with credit-based input supply no longer being undertaken, loyalty will lose most of its rationale. In addition, cooperatives may experience falling purchases as a result of failures of liquidity and a further decline in price competitiveness. possession of land and cattle, areas under cotton cultivation, cotton sales volumes, membership of primary cooperative societies and marketing behaviour are all socially stratified along lines of oxen ownership/non-ownership. Social stratification is partly attenuated however, most notably as a result of the heterogeneous character of oxen owners as a group. The relationship between  socio-economic stratification and some of the attributes discussed above is an  interesting one. The group which is best off with regard to land and cattle, has the largest areas under cotton cultivation and the highest cotton sales volumes also has the highest membership of cooperatives and ostensibly the least          commercially-oriented marketing behaviour.This pattern dates to the period when cooperatives were important providers of external resources and were thus subject to efforts by better-off groups to control them. little or no differentiation of farming methods according to the described pattern of social stratification could be detected. Apart from differences arising from the possession/non-possession of oxen themselves (i.e., concerning methods of land preparation) the rural upper strata farmed in more or less exactly the same way as the lower one. Liberalisation of marketing in Tanzanian agriculture has (re-) accelerated commodification but has not disturbed the essentially extensive forms it reverted to during the 1980s. This tendency in turn reflects not only the ‘embeddedness’ of certain farming systems, but - as will be explored in subsequent papers -deregulation of markets in forms which exclusively reward quantity of output and which systematically mitigate deficiencies in output quality.

eldis:A68048;Rwanda land tenure regularisation case study;;Land has historically been a source of dispute and conflict in Rwanda, compounded by the social unrest which resulted in the 1994 genocide. Up to one million people were killed and three million fled to neighbouring countries, leading to weakened political institutions, infrastructure and human capital. Traditional land allocation systems also suffered. In the aftermath of the genocide there was a lack of clarity over legal status and rights to land, with landowners returning to Rwanda to find their land occupied by others.This Evidence on Demand Helpdesk Report provides a detailed case study on the approach taken to land tenure reform by the DFID-funded Land Tenure Regularisation Programme (LTRSP) in Rwanda. The case study should provide the reader with an understanding of how land tenure reform can work under particular social, political and economic conditions, as well as the approach taken to ensure gender equality in land rights. ;"P.

eldis:A27916;Recent FAO experiences in land reform and land tenure;;Brief summary of FAO’s experience in agrarian reform and the most relevant activities of the current programme related to this field. It argues that the type of agrarian reform that considers the redistribution of land from the rich to the poor either through confiscation or through pre-emptive buyouts belongs to the past. However, this does not mean that Member Nations have stopped seeking ways to improve access to productive resources (land, water, etc.) as a cornerstone to their rural development policy. Indeed, there is now an increasing demand from Member Nations for assistance in exploring ways of accomplishing the rural development goals of agrarian reform within the policy framework of economic and political liberalization. Therefore, FAO gives great importance to establishing an efficient network on the subject as part of its programme development in follow-up activities to the World Food Summit.

eldis:A22066;Tinkering on the fringes?: redistributive land reforms and chronic poverty in Southern Africa;;In Southern Africa, landlessness due to the asset alienation that occurred during colonial occupation has been acknowledged as one of several ultimate causes of chronic poverty. Land redistribution is often seen as a powerful tool in the fight against poverty in areas where a majority of people are rural-based and make a living mostly, if not entirely, off the land. This paper examines the nature and extent of land reform in Southern Africa, with a particular focus on its contribution to poverty reduction.Clearly identifying the different types of land reform, the author examines the policy and practice in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The analysis leads to the following conclusions:despite political appetite for deracialising land ownership, there is little evidence to show a commitment to link this process to poverty reduction - in all three countries in question, policy rhetoric on land as a poverty-reducing asset often has not been supported with a serious commitment of resourcesthe quality of land provided and the terms of access both compromise the ability of beneficiaries to ensure a secure livelihood - in this sense, the current conceptualisation of land reform does little to reduce povertyin all three countries there has been policy capture of land reform initiatives by members of the political and bureaucratic elite at the expense of the poorall three countries demonstrate a reluctance to meaningfully reform customary forms of tenure - there is, however, growing evidence of commoditisation of land under such customary tenure that may not always work for poor householdsthere is a significant lack of good quality data at the country level for the systematic monitoring of the impact of land reform - monitoring and evaluation systems seem to emerge as afterthoughts.The author concludes that, although some people have clearly benefitted greatly from land reform policies, there is no clear link between these policies and poverty reduction. ;A.O.

eldis:A27914;A critical analysis of the causes of world food insecurity;;Although world food and agricultural production, based on current trends, should be sufficient to meet demand in the decades ahead, the world still faces a serious food crisis that is as dangerous and life-threatening for millions of poor people today as in the past. The main objective of this article is to illuminate the world food situation and to make a critical analysis of the root causes of world food insecurity by identifying the various misconceptions surrounding our understanding of hunger, starvation and poverty. A clear and deeper understanding of the real causes of hunger and malnutrition in poor countries is imperative to challenge and enable policy-makers and planners to lay the groundwork at the grassroots level for appropriate policy measures and development programmes aimed at alleviating poverty and ensuring food security.

eldis:A27913;The reconstruction of rural institutions;;"At the end of the 1980s, most agriculture in Latin America and the Caribbean shared the following features: an over-protected agricultural sector; strong intervention from the state; excessive regulations and obstacles to interactions with other economic agents; a static land market; and a bimodal type of productive organization, i.e. a few powerful economic units and a large mass of smallholder producers. During recent years, in the context of economic and political liberalization, analyses and public debate on agriculture in developing countries have explored new trends that include a broader view of the role of agriculture, a change in strategies and a new conception of the interactions among markets, state and civil society. The task of transforming the cluster of state institutions in the rural sector has been very significant. Although some important progress has been made, governments still have a long way to go and there is a lack of institutional answers to the demands and needs of less well-endowed producers. This article reflects on the issues of rural institutions and their reconstruction [author] ";G.

eldis:A27911;Cultural issues in land information systems;;Considers the cultural dimension of applying the land information system (LIS) concept to lands held under customary land tenure. The article recognizes that the LIS concept has been developed primarily to serve the needs of countries with a western-style land market where individual land rights are the norm. However, many countries where customary landholdings exist, or predominate, are also interested in establishing LISs to manage their land resources better. The article has three main sections. In the first section, western LIS concepts are reviewed, placing their development in a historical perspective. This section includes a sample of the main attributes of land that are stored in a typical LIS. The article then reviews the main features of customary land tenure systems that distinguish them from western systems. Drawing examples from Fiji, where one of the authors is involved in establishing an LIS, the article compares land rights under western tenure to those under customary tenure and discusses the cultural implications of including these attributes in an LIS.

eldis:A20246;Diamonds, foreign aid, and the uncertain prospects for post-conflict reconstruction in Sierra Leone;;This article examines the external and internal dimensions and resources of post-conflict reconstruction in Sierra Leone. Foreign aid represents the bulk of the external sources of support, though its imminent reduction is a significant concern. Internally resources, such as diamond exports, offer much potential as a means to spur economic growth and reconstruction, but diamonds may also very well disrupt reconstruction efforts.The paper finds that:while foreign donors have been financing many reconstruction projects it is uncertain what level of international aid will be received by Sierra Leone in the medium and long terminternal sources of reconstruction are equally uncertain: while diamond exports have been growing at a healthy rate since the final years of the civil war, particularly since the official end of hostilities at the beginning of 2002, a number of obstacles remain:diamond smuggling and illicit mining persist in Sierra Leone, despite the strengthening of legislationregional instability may place the diamond mines at risk once again should hostilities resume in Liberia or emerge in Guineait is risky to rely on a single commodity for the bulk of export earnings, especially as diamond resources themselves are finitethe present challenge is to focus on more medium- and long-term reconstruction solutions, entailing more conventional forms of developmentthe psychological and physical trauma endured by the people of Sierra Leone cannot be ignored by efforts to spur economic growth and reconstruction as this is crucial to prevent a resumption of the vicious cycle of greed and grievance that led to the outbreak of civil war in the first place. ;J.

eldis:A59395;Malawi's settlement schemes: rural towns that failed to take off;;In the late 1960s the Malawi government established irrigated settlement schemes throughout the country with the goal of promoting the production of rice for export to raise farmers' incomes. A supplementary objective was to promote the development of a sense of nationhood among people of different ethnic backgrounds settled on the schemes. The permanent settlement of people and their investment of surplus incomes in the local economy was envisaged to spur the growth of rural towns. The evidence shows that permanent settlement has been insignificant and the expected growth of rural towns has not materialized. The evidence indicates that returns from the small holdings that people were permitted to use on thescheme, combined with the low prices of a controlled price regime, were inadequate for investment in meaningful economic enterprises that would create employment and improve the local economy. The liberalisation of crop trading did not improve the situation. Even if it were possible to generate high enoughincomes, it is likely that such surplus would be reinvested in their home villages with which they retained very close links and which they appear to have a moral obligation, to develop. The evidence also shows that it was unrealistic to expect young people, even with low levels of education, to spend the rest of their lives as small scale farmers. They tended to save for a life outside agriculture, or leave the scheme when life in such remote locations became unbearable. It is unlikely that the goal of rural towns will ever be achieved especially now that the schemes are being turned over to communities, which are unlikely to use them as intensively as intended. The evidence from the three schemes suggests that the assumptions on which the schemes were established have not matched the reality. ;P.

eldis:A16151;Land tenure and rural development;;"The purpose of this guide is to provide support to those who are assessing and designing appropriate responses to food insecurity and rural development situations. This guide aims to show where and why land tenure is an important issue in food security and sustainable rural livelihoods. The main objective of these guidelines is to provide detailed suggestions for consideration of land tenure issues in rural development policy. The authors facilitate this by:defining land tenure and how it is administered in different situationsrevealing the various stakeholders who have an interest in land: those who control it and how they exercise that control; those who use it; and those, often women, indigenous peoples and other disadvantaged groups, who may be landless or may have insecure claims to landanalysing contexts where land tenure is currently of critical concern, such as:situations where unsustainable increases in pressure on, or insecure tenure over, land resources give rise to environmental degradationwhere gender-discrimination in access to land disadvantages individuals, households and communitieswhere conflicts may have been provoked by disputed access, or may make problems of access difficult to addressThe authors main conclusions for effective consideration of land tenure include:ensuring that the State provides necessary regulations and assurances to maintain secure access to land even during periods of land administration decentralizationensuring that the States involves local communities and local governments in the administration and management of land and other natural resources, to create a new form of social contract between the two groupsoffering short-term interventions to ensure that any policy changes happen smoothly and sustainably, and being vigilant to the effects of these policy changes on populations and environmentsThe paper concludes with a list of relevant literature for further research.[adapted from author] ";;;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"development;land;land tenure;food security;poverty;rural development;property;tenants;women";"Land & Gender;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16151;http://www.fao.org/sd/2003/IN0501_en.htm;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fao.org%2Fsd%2F2003%2FIN0501_en.htm;;;;"Food security and livelihoods;Agriculture and food;land;rights;food;Gender;Social protection;Land tenure;Access;property;Rural poverty;Food security;Poverty;Livelihoods agricultural assets;Rural development;tenure;security;ruralpoverty;tenants;participation;women"

eldis:A27918;Poverty alleviation : the role of rural institutions and participation;;"Most approaches to poverty alleviation focus on income and subsidy measures; however, there is a growing realization that these measures alone are not sufficient. The growing amount of literature on the important role that “social capital” and institutions play in the development process indicates that there is a social-institutional dimension as well. This article focuses on the institutional dimension of rural poverty alleviation and outlines why institution- and capacity-building should be fundamental elements of any strategy aiming at alleviating rural poverty. Analysing some of the main weaknesses of past poverty alleviation strategies, it highlights the potential role and function that rural institutions and grassroots organizations can play in poverty alleviation efforts. The article is based on normative analysis and field experiences in implementing anti-poverty programmes collected by the Rural Institutions and Participation Service of FAO. [author] ";"Stephan Baas

eldis:A37468;Secure land rights for all;;"Secure land rights are important for development and poverty reduction and the greatest challenges for providing such rights are in urban, peri-urban areas, and the most productive rural areas. This publication updates and revises UN-HABITAT’s 2004 publication ‘Urban Land for All’, and stresses the need for policies that facilitate access to land for all sections of their existing and future populations – particularly those on low or irregular incomes. The paper begins by explaining what is meant by secure land rights for all, outlining the concept of tenure security and the range of types of land tenure that give access to land in various countries. It then moves on to discuss the importance of these rights, reviewing examples from around the world. The final part of the report explains the importance of land for government in greater depth, showing how policies, tenure options, land administration and development planning can be improved. The paper concludes that secure tenure and property rights have a direct role in the full realisation of human rights, including the right to shelter, the right to earn a livelihood and the elimination of discrimination against women, the vulnerable, indigenous groups and other minorities. It is noted that, despite the efforts of governments and international agencies, in practice the interests of the poor and vulnerable are often neglected. Renewed political will and improved incentives for central and local government  are required to make land access secure for all against a background of climate change and environmental crises. Recommendations include that policy makers should: 

    recognise and protect land rights established under customary, religious and informal tenure systems and provide guarantees and legal remedies against arbitrary eviction without adequate compensation 
    adopt long-term, incremental approaches, with a range of tenure options to improve security of land and property rights for those in informal settlements and the rural poor 
    focus urgently on those peri-urban areas coming under pressure for rapid residential development and replacement of rural uses, in order to secure the rights of all land users and promote sustainable urbanisation 
    develop strategies to secure land rights across the urban-rural continuum, in response to four major inter-related trends: accelerated urbanisation, increasing migration, land use changes, and risks related to environmental degradation and climate change 
    review regulatory frameworks and remove or relax constraints on access to affordable land and housing

Drawing on secondary data, it describes the extent and rate of deforestation in the region and attempts to analyse the causes.Its findings include that:deforestation appeared to accelerate sharply during the 1980s and 1990s: roughly the same amount of forest was lost during 1989 and 1993 as during the previous three decadesshifting cultivation is the main source of livelihoods for people living in the hill areas of north-east India and is often seen as one of the main agents of deforestationwhereas cultivation cycles as long as 20 to 30 years prevailed prior to the 1950s, population pressure and land scarcity in more recent years has seen the cycles reduced to 3 to 5 years; consequently, abandoned plots rarely have enough time to regeneratetimber logging, including a large illegal trade in timber, and collection of wood for fuel, are among the other causes of deforestationsome ""sacred groves"" – areas of forest held sacred by traditional belief systems – have been left relatively undisturbed in the region, and act as important storehouses of biodiversity, although cultural changes in recent years have posed a threat to their survival.The paper remarks on the piquancy of the situation in North East India: elsewhere in India there have been struggles to give local communities rights over forests in an attempt to stem environmental degradation and forest loss; but in the North East, the communities already have control and authority over natural resources, and forest loss has occurred in spite of this.The paper concludes by suggesting some ways in which future policy might improve the sustainability of forest use in the region, including:there is a need to document and monitor existing sacred groves and analyse their value for biodiversity conservationsustainable management of forest resources has to be centred around the costs and benefits to the community, since it is with the community that ownership rights restidentifying ways of minimising the deleterious effects of shifting cultivation, while retaining the basic features, could be the most feasible solution.

eldis:A8753;Common property: can customary law adapt to the free market?;;Transition from subsistence to market economy is not easy. In Papua New Guinea most land is still held under traditional systems of common property resource ownership and a growing cash economy can spark conflict concerning management or ownership issues. Research presented at the annual meeting of the UK Development Studies Association (DSA) examines the institutional limitations, during transition, of traditional ownership systems. Data from Morobe villages suggest that subsistence-based common property regimes may lack the institutional capacity to regulate the economic opportunism of individuals and to achieve a measure of collective sustainable development. ;John Rivers;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"common property;property;customary law;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";150;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A8753;http://www.id21.org/society/1ajr1.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fsociety%2F1ajr1.html;;;;"Agriculture and food;social capital;customary law;subsistence;transition;Communal land;markets;sustainability;Rural Papua New Guinea;fishing;common property rights;Land tenure;rural;common property;inter-generational transfer;resources"
eldis:A14282;Sudan, oil, and human rights;;This report examines the human cost of oil, and corporate complicity in the Sudanese government’s human rights abuses. It finds that oil is an important obstacle to lasting peace in Sudan, and oil revenues have been used by the government to obtain weapons and ammunition that have enabled it to intensify the war and expand oil development. The large-scale exploitation of oil by foreign companies operating in the theatre of war in southern Sudan has increased human rights abuses there and has exacerbated the long-running conflict in Sudan.The report outlines the history of the oil sector in Sudan, summarising the experiences of a number of oil companies, and evidence of large-scale displacement of southern Sudanese as a result of the oil operations, and the intensification of civil war. It also provides a detailed account of the human rights consequences of oil development in Sudan, including population displacement, ethnic manipulation, aerial bombings of civilians, property destruction, waste, and, especially for many Nuer and Dinka, human misery and despair.The report finds that oil company representatives were aware of human rights abuses, and were complicit with the government, and its preference for business as usual over policies aimed at ending abuses.  It concludes that the companies investigated are inappropriately operating in Sudan and should suspend their operations unless and until a set of minimum benchmarks are met, including:Displacement:companies: should adequately finance a team, under the supervision of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, to compile an authoritative, credible survey of the identities and numbers of civilians forcibly displaced in or from the relevant oil concessions. Its findings should be made public, and should be in a form usable for determining future compensationthe government: should provide temporary accommodation for those who have been displaced in accordance with the standards utilized by the UNHCR. It should implement a credible and verifiable process to allow those forcibly displaced to return to their homes, with adequate compensation. If return is not possible, it provides them with adequate compensation for an acceptable place of relocation. Compensation should include not only relocation funds, but also compensation for the loss of livelihood, family members, and property, and pain and suffering as a result of government army or militia attack and subsequent displacement. It should permit unimpeded access to the oil-producing areas for Sudanese citizens, international organizations, human rights monitors, journalists, and humanitarian organizationsTransparency:oil companies, consortia members, and subcontractors should disclose whether they have provided cash or in kind equipment or services for military, security, or dual use purposesthe government should adhere in full to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Code of Good Practices for Fiscal Transparency. It should publish the audits that the IMF Auditor General has conducted of Sudapet oil revenue and Sudanese government revenue from 1999 through 2002, and of the year 2003, and future such auditsIn addition, the report lists further recommendations to companies, the government of Sudan, the United States, the Canadian government, the European Union, China and Malaysia, the UN Security Council, the World Bank and the Sudanese rebel forces. ;;;Human Rights Watch ;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"extractive industries;displacement";Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;"SDN;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14282;http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/sudan1103/;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrw.org%2Freports%2F2003%2Fsudan1103%2F;;;;"human rights abuse;SPLA;Pastoralism;corporate social responsibility;Conflict and security;Stakeholders in conflict;Governance;Agriculture and food;oil;climate change as driver of conflict;extractive industries;Corporate Social Responsibility;Security;Dinka;Drivers of conflict;Nuer;CSR;Human rights;resource conflict;Business;Extractive industries oil;New wars;SPLM;Displacement;civil war;Globalisation;company complicity;Business and corruption;complex emergencies;Business and human rights;Extractive industries;Southern Sudan;oil curse feature;Good governance human rights;conflict"
eldis:A61601;A New Direction in Climate Compatible Development: Indonesia's Forest Moratorium;;This policy-brief examines a two year moratorium on new permits for primary natural forest and peat land that came into force in Indonesia on May 20th 2011. The brief aims to inform a range of decision-making actors in developing countries about the nature of improved forestry management in the face of a changing climate. It is asserted that the moratorium demonstrates progress in the areas of: data transparency, industry buy-in, political support and institutional co-ordination. In order to extend the benefits of the two year moratorium, it is recommended that there should be a concerted focus on: licensing and spatial planning reform, capacity building for data transparency, monitoring and enforcement, vertical coordination with provincial and district governments and metrics for success. ;K Austen;;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;eldis;01/01/2012;en;"development;climate change;land use;research";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"IDN;030;009;034";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A61601;http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Indonesia-InsideStory2.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdkn.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F05%2FIndonesia-InsideStory2.pdf;;;;"pubcountry:UK;Climate change;Land use;research;Climate change mitigation;Climate change Forestry;Climate change agriculture and food security;service:Indonesia;tfmimport;Climate change governance"
eldis:A12998;Sustainable rural livelihoods: practical concepts for the 21st century;;"Working on the premise that in the 21st century there may be two or three times the human population than at the time of writing, this paper explores the concept of sustainable livelihoods. The analysis points to priorities for policy and research, including pricing and taxing policies for the rich that would reduce environmental demand, and further research into small farming systems, local economies and factors influencing migration.
Findings:

    capability, equity and sustainability are the fundamental means and ends of sustainable livelihoods. Capability is the ability to perform certain basic functions, to cope with stresses and shocks and the ability to find and make use of livelihood opportunities. Equity is more equal distribution of assets, capabilities and opportunities, and an end to discrimination. Sustainability is the ability to maintain and improve livelihoods while maintaining or enhancing the assets on which livelihoods depend
    planning for future livelihoods implies placing value on the future. However the future is often undervalued due to discounting, lack of democratic representation of future generations and an inability to predict future trends (e.g. population, technology, social change)
    enhancing livelihood intensity is possible. There is now better understanding of complex, diverse and risk-prone agriculture that can be enhanced by diversification with interlinking enterprises. Degraded resources have been proven to present immense livelihood potential for the poor, and they are protected by their low value to others. Many small-scale economic opportunities other than farming can be generated locally, and this can result in a synergy of recirculation of income. Optimising this synergy of recirculation should be a central priority.
    net sustainable livelihoods is a measure of the number of environmentally and socially sustainable livelihoods that provide an adequate living in a context, less their negative effect on the benefits and sustainability of the totality of other livelihoods elsewhere. This does not require a precise measure of 'how much', but rather relative values, weightings or trends can be usable for decision-making

Recommendation: policies and programmes that enhance capability, improve equity and increase social sustainability for the poor should be promoted. These should include flexible credit for new small enterprises, securing rights to resources, especially land, and accessible health services. ";"R. Chambers

eldis:A26960;Social exclusion and Africa south of the Sahara: A review of the literature;;"Review for sub-Saharan Africa, examines the English-language literature and focuses on four important dimensions of exclusion: (i) exclusion from agricultural land; (ii) exclusion from agricultural livelihood; (iii) exclusion from formal and informal employment; (iv) exclusion from organization and representation.Paper is organized in six sections. The first section discusses concepts of exclusion. The main body of the review examines the four dimensions of exclusion listed above. In each of the sections, material is selected to exemplify different analytical positions, and the review is not intended to be exhaustive. In each section, attention is paid to processes of exclusion, and to ethnicity and gender as social identities which form the basis for exclusionary practices. The final section identifies considers the trajectory of exclusion in terms of changing interrelationships between the dimensions. The discussions on the four dimensions of exclusion include some comments on policies to combat social exclusion, but no attempt is made to provide an overview of policies. There are important, relevant and complex debates proceeding in relation to a number of key policy issues, including land reform (through the introduction of individual titles to land); democracy; gender; and dismantling apartheid.

The authors exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles across squatters in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires, Argentina, to evaluate the impact of property rights on child health and education outcomes. In addressing the effect of allocating urban land property rights in a manner that was exogeneous to characteristics of the squatters, the authors found that:children living in titled parcels enjoy better Weight-for-Height scores (a short-run measure of health status), lower teenage pregnancy rates, and lower school repetition grades than children living in untitled parcels.there were insignificant differences in Height-for-Age scores.The findings suggest that access to land titles allows families to improve their investments in human capital [adapted from author] ;"E.

eldis:A37867;Trends in sustainable development;;"This report highlights key developments and recent sustainability trends in agriculture, rural development, land, desertification and drought, five of the six themes being considered by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) at its 16th and 17th sessions (2008-2009). The report notes progress in a number of areas while, at the same time, acknowledging that in other areas significant work is still needed to advance implementation of intergovernmentally agreed goals and targets.In particular, the report finds that efforts to reduce poverty and improve food security in developing countries are hampered by declining support for strong agricultural growth. It argues that strong agricultural growth is four times more effective than growth in other sectors in benefiting the poorest half of the population. However, while many developing countries have posted gains in agricultural production, distribution and exports, people living in areas of high inequality and in isolation from the broader economy typically benefit little from them. Key trends highlighted in the report include:

    public spending on agriculture has fallen in all regions except Asia over the past generation, with the drop in Latin America the most dramatic
    foreign assistance for agriculture is at low levels. In real terms, agriculture accounted for just 4 per cent of bilateral assistance in 2003, down from 16 per cent in 1980
    more regions have become net food importers since the mid-1990s, including East Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa
    markets for value-added exports from developing countries are limited by high tariffs and low brand recognition in developed countries. Many developing country producers are unable to meet strict standards in developed nations
    developing regions are likely to stay mostly rural until 2020. South and Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa will remain more than 50 per cent rural until 2030
    non-farm income represents an increasingly important share of rural income in developing countries
    two billion people live in drylands, areas that have the world’s lowest per capita GDP and highest infant mortality rates. These populations are especially vulnerable to further land degradation.
    droughts can be predictable, making it possible to respond with regional early warning systems. In Africa, droughts tend to result in high mortality rates, particularly in the sub-Saharan region, due to the low level of preparedness. In some developing countries, drought wiped out more than 5 per cent of the previous year’s GDP.

eldis:A44409;Understanding farmers' perceptions and adaptations to climate change and variability: the case of the Limpopo Basin, South Africa;;"This report outlines how climate change is expected to have serious environmental, economic, and social impacts in South Africa. It states that rural farmers, whose livelihoods depend on the use of natural resources, are likely to bear the brunt of adverse impacts. The research uses a “bottom-up” approach to gain insights from the farmers themselves based on a farm household survey collected from 794 households in the Limpopo River Basin of South Africa for the farming season 2004–2005. Findings from the paper show that the following variables influence farmer perceptions of climate adaptation:

    household size - large household will be more willing to choose other adaptations such as soil conservation techniques, chemical treatments that are labour-intensive especially in small-scale farming which involves household labour
    farming experience - experienced farmers have an increased likelihood of using portfolio diversification, changing planting dates, and changing the amount of land under production
    wealth - wealthier households are more willing to adapt by changing their planting dates
    farm size - large-scale farmers are more likely to adapt because they have more capital and resources. Therefore, they can easily invest in irrigation technologies, which demand high investment costs
    soil fertility - the perception of having highly fertile soil increases the probability that farmers will change their amount of land under cultivation
    access to extension services - farmers who have access to extension services are more likely to be aware of changing climatic conditions and to have knowledge of the various management practices that they can use to adapt to changes in climatic conditions
    tenure - having secure property rights increases the probability of farmers to adapt by 9 percent. with proper property rights, farmers may be able change their amount of land under cultivation to adjust to new climatic conditions.

The paper concludes that household size, farming experience, wealth, access to credit, access to water, tenure rights, off-farm activities, and access to extension are the main factors that enhance farmer adaptive capacity to climate change. The author emphasizes that governments should design policies that address these factors. ";G.

eldis:A27282;Contestation over Political Space: The State and Demobilisation of Party Politics in Kenya;;Appraises political liberalization and subsequent contestation over political space in Kenya. The discussion centres on how, from the colonial period,  elite politics have precluded organization and crystallization of popular democracy.The paper specifically examines the historicity of political factionalism and attendant          decline of multi-partyism. It also looks at the socio-economic conditions responsible for the weakening of opposition politics.From the 1980s, interest in the study of practice of politics in Africa has centred around interrelations between Africa's weak civil society, neo-patrimonialism, and  the continent's development problems. Neo-liberalism has dominated in these studies a majority of which tend to emphasis that neo-patrimonialism and weak civil   society, within a restricted socio-political pluralization, are responsible for Africa's economic and political problems.                    Since the beginning of the 1990s, several countries have implemented economic and political liberalization in different forms. The extent to which the unfolding reform corresponds to aspirations of the society is debatable however. It is apparent that  economic and political liberalization has continually glossed over popular demands in the rush to reconstruct neo-liberal ideals of competitive politics and power of the markets.

eldis:A26682;Does Corruption Affect Income Inequality and Poverty?;;"Studies of the consequences of corruption have mainly focused on economic efficiency. This paper illustrates that corruption can also have distributional consequences. Corruption increases income inequality and poverty through lower economic growth; biased tax systems favoring the rich and well-connected; poor targeting of social programs; use of wealth by the well-to-do to lobby government for favorable policies that perpetuate inequality in asset ownership; lower social spending; unequal access to education; and a higher risk in investment decisions of the poor. Cross-country regression analysis for 1980.97 shows that high and rising corruption increases income inequality and poverty through the above channels. The impact of corruption on income inequality and poverty is considerable. A worsening in the corruption index of a country by one standard deviation (2.52 points on a scale of 0 to 10) is associated with the same increase in the Gini coefficient as a reduction in average secondary schooling of 2.3 years. A one-standard-deviation increase in the growth rate of corruption (a deterioration of 0.78 percentage point) reduces income growth of the poor by 7.8 percentage points a year. The results are valid for countries at different stages of economic development, with different growth experiences, and using various indices of corruption. They hold even when controlling for other factors that affect income inequality and poverty such as natural resources, capital-output ratios or capital productivity, educational attainment, access to education, and distribution of land. The results further show that higher social spending reduces poverty but has no effect on income inequality. These findings suggest that adverse distributional consequences of corruption can be mitigated by sound management of natural resources; broad-based, labor-intensive growth; efficient spending on education and health; effective targeting of social programs; and increased access to education.

eldis:A20410;Land reform, agriculture and poverty reduction;;Most land-based livelihoods rely on having secure access to land, a precondition for sustainable agriculture, economic growth and poverty reduction. This working paper examines the state of knowledge with regard to aspects of land reform- redistributive reform, land tenure reform, and the issue of land markets.  It also addresses issues that remain unknown in areas of land and social equity, land administration, and land tax.Redistributive land reform aims to bring about an equitable distribution of land and the political power emanating from it. Past results have been less than impressive, and agrarian restructuring has been very slow.Tenure reform, has been plagued by a failure to appreciate the complex and highly contested nature of land issues in post-colonial states. The paper notes that land policy reform is unlikely to have significant poverty reducing effects unless attention is paid to institutional capacity building.Efficient transactions in land markets can encourage the transfer of land from less productive to more productive use, but excessive state regulation and bureaucracy are often the norm. Temporary transfers through land rental are an important redistribution mechanism. Rental markets- an important redistribution mechanism- have lower transaction costs and can help households deal with shocks or stresses without loss of productive assets.What don’t we still know about land reform? The following pertinent questions remain:what are the precise transmission mechanisms by which land reform contributes to poverty reduction?what are the synergies and/or trade-offs between greater equality in land ownership and increasing agricultural growth for poverty reduction?what kinds of land transfers can be carried out within land administration for improved growth and poverty outcomes in agriculture?how do current land administration arrangements prevent land transfers for positive growth and poverty reduction?what sorts of revised approaches to land administration are best, and how can they be designed and implemented?what forms of land and production taxes are most likely to encourage increases in agricultural productivity?how can land taxation systems be designed so they do not discourage investments by small-scale farmers, and under what circumstances is this appropriate? ;;;Department for International Development, UK;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"land;land registration;poverty;land tenure;land reform;agriculture";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A20410;http://dfid-agriculture-consultation.nri.org/summaries/wp5.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdfid-agriculture-consultation.nri.org%2Fsummaries%2Fwp5.pdf;;;;"land reform;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;land redistribution;Land registration;Communal land"

The publication analyses challenges from the point of view of the operational practice that has developed. It makes the following observations: 

    water is life and it should be protected by international humanitarian law
    the planet is undergoing climate changes that will determine the management of water resources
    half of the world population live in urban areas
    the nature of armed conflict has changed for the worse and the people's living conditions are at the heart of ICRC's response
    the response is more effective if implemented in cooperation with the beneficiary communities. 

The publication concludes by stating that global changes will determine new avenues and solutions to be pursued to ensure that the ICRC's response is still appropriate to the needs of the people affected by future conflicts.

eldis:A14308;The dualities of contemporary Zimbabwean politics: constitutionalism versus the law of power and the land, 1999-2002;;This paper explores the dualities in the coexistence within Zimbabwean politics of constitutionalism and legality versus a complex combination of paralegal, supralegal, oppressive and brutal political action, especially as this pertains to elections and land. The analysis is set in the period 1999-2002. The investigation concerns the issue of how the Zimbabwe African National Unity - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) government had been using a complex combination of constitutionalism-legality and the unconstitutional-paralegal to ensure political survival, despite national resistance and international pressure.Findings include:the state contested and manipulated both the practice and discourse of human rights, recasting the 'individual' and the 'liberal' in the context of 'African' and 'socialist', but with the slant to favour the government of the dayin the electoral domain ZANU-PF uses the legality of constitutionalism to aid and veil unconstitutional, arbitrary, and authoritarian means of maintaining power, and simultaneously garners the moral force of land and colonialism to create 'political immunity'ZANU-PF’s anchoring of its electoral conquest in the issue of the land and post colonial liberation superimposed forms of legitimacy and justice that tended to override paralegal and supra-legal actionthe great dilemma for Zimbabwe is to decide whether there are circumstances in which contemporary manifestations of collective and social group rights of restitution to the dispossessed should prevail over adherence to constitutional and legal procedure and justice - if the former cannot be achieved by means of the latter.[adapted from author] ;S.

eldis:A37510;Poverty, pastoralism and policy in Ngorongoro: lessons learned from the Ereto I Ngorongoro pastoralist project with implications for pastoral development and the policy debate;;"Recent years have seen pastoralist communities in Tanzania becoming increasingly impoverished and vulnerable, due to  livestock diseases, drought, fluctuating market prices and unfavourable policies. This paper discusses strategies to address the last of these factors with reference to the Ereto-Ngorongoro Pastoralist Project, which was set up in response to growing concern about the unprecedented and rising levels of poverty among pastoralists in Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). 
The paper begins with a brief overview of pastoralism in Tanzania, the policy environment in which pastoralist production systems operate, and approaches to improving pastoralist livelihoods. It then looks in detail at pastoralist livelihoods and production in Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and reviews the Ereto I project and its impacts. The paper concludes with lessons learned from Ereto I and considers how these lessons can be linked to policy dialogue on support for sustainable pastoralist livelihoods. The authors find that Ereto I succeeded in promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty by using participatory approaches to work with pastoralists on their own development issues and providing appropriate support for their livelihood strategies. The authors argue that this provides an important example with far-reaching implications for policy dialogue in the present context of pastoralism and policy formulation in Tanzania. Key lessons learned include: 

    maximising the size and returns from livestock herds in good years to generate a surplus for the inevitable bad years is crucial as a means of reducing pastoral poverty
    the links between water rights and range management are critical for the sustainable use of pasture, improved livestock productivity and peaceful co-existence of different communities
    pastoralism is not just a traditional form of raising livestock, it is a livestock-based livelihood system regulated by ecology with complex modes of social, political and economic organisation with the capacity to adapt to changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. Thus, adopting a holistic approach is crucial

The report stresses the importance of forest resources in fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, in particular in meeting the targets set for reducing poverty and ensuring a sustainable global environment.The main headline from the report is that whilst 13 million hectares of the world’s forests are still lost annually due to deforestation, this rate of net forest loss is slowing down, thanks to new planting and natural expansion of existing forests.Other main findings include:Deforestation: South America suffered the largest net loss of forests between 2000 and 2005 Asia moved from a net loss of around 800 000 ha per year in the 1990s to a net gain of one million hectares per year between 2000 and 2005, primarily as a result of large-scale afforestation reported by China primary forests account for 36 percent of total forest area, but are being lost or modified at a rate of 6 million hectares a year through deforestation or selective loggingForest use:While most forests are managed for multiple uses, FRA 2005 found that 11 percent are designated principally for the conservation of biological diversity - an estimated increase of 96 million hectares since 1990Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilize sand dunes and protect coastal areasOne-third of the world’s forests are mainly used for production of wood, fibre and non-wood products, and more than half have production of these products as one of their management objectives, indicating the importance of forest products at the local, national and international levelsthe amount of carbon stored in forest biomass decreased globally by 1.1 Gt annually between 1990 and 2005.

eldis:A12659;Is land a human rights issue? approaching land reform in South Africa;;This essay briefly explores South African post-apartheid land reform as a human rights issue. It suggests that land reform has an ethically, politically and strategically important interface with international human rights. This refers both to the context-dependent livelihood role of land and to context-independent principles regarding land ownership and governance, involving several types of rights (allocation, protection, provision, procedure and development). It discusses the merit and limitation of a state-centric perspective on human rights and development. This places “human rights” in a social, contested process of rights- and land-based development. A state-centric human rights system has an important role in this process, but rights-based development requires a broader vision of how people realise rights in social dynamics. ;P.

eldis:A22949;A note on food security and land tenure security in Lesotho;;In this note of food security and land tenure security in Lesotho, the authors present arguments in favour of the enactment and implementation of a legislation in Lesotho that will enhance land tenure security in the country. Some of the arguments include:Tenure insecurity is not the primary constraint on the contribution that farming can make to food security in Lesotho, but:women’s access rights and widow’s tenure security are inadequatemore secure access to additional land for a minority of better-resourced and more-productive farmers could contribute more to aggregate food securityarable tenure security and land use are currently impaired by confused interim arrangements for land administration and land reform lawscommunity-based natural resource management structures need to be reinforced by clearer communal tenure security and administrative arrangements.Tenure insecurity is a primary constraint on the general economic growth in other, non-farm sectors on which food security in Lesotho increasingly depends:insecurity of urban and peri-urban land access and rights is a threat to food securitywomen’s insecure access to land in urban and peri-urban settings needs to be addressedthe economy cannot prosper and food security not assured, unless people can invest securely in land improvements and productive land usespolicies securing the land rights of the poor will become increasingly important with the increased mobilisation, specialisation and incorporation of rural areas into market economiesbank loans for investments require collateral underwritten by land tenure securityland disputes aggravates tenure insecurity of the landtenure security is inadequately protected by laws when people are deprived of their land by the state.The authors conclude that the enactment and implementation of this legislation will make an essential contribution to the nation’s food security. ;"S.

eldis:A13872;Poverty and environmental degradation in the drylands: an overview of problems;;This paper seeks to analyse some of the problems of degradation persisting in the dryland regions with particular reference to Sub-Saharan Africa, and describe the processes that aim to tackle them.It identifies the threat to dryland regions as a complex mixture of degrading soils, continuous exposures to frequent droughts and political and economic marginalisation which is putting poor people living in the drylands at risk. To understand the complexities of the current problems the authors critically review the historical debates and ecological concepts, surrounding the ideas of desertification and degradation and the assumptions on which they rest. Similarly explanations regarding the relationships between population, poverty, and environmental degradation are explored and different approaches towards tackling the problems in the drylands are discussed, with specific attention to the case of pastoralism.The paper then turns to describing and discussing the efforts of the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to implement policies and practices conducive to preventing degradation in the drylands. The authors position is that the UNCCD needs to review its primary aims to determine whether it is an environmental convention, or a convention aimed at developing the drylands. They argue strongly for the latter option putting forward the view that lack of international financial support is hampering progress and that the implementation of the CCD will be a difficult task unless the goals of  development and poverty reduction in the drylands are endorsed as the cornerstones of the convention reflecting the priorities of the big donors.Some specific suggestions as to further contribitutions which Norway can make are also put forward. ;"S.

eldis:A70760;Flash flood risk management: a training of trainers manual ;;"Unstable geological conditions and steep topography, combined with frequent extreme weather conditions, make the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region prone to many natural hazards. Among these, flash floods – severe flood events that occur with little warning – are particularly challenging for communities, threatening lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure. Vulnerable groups such as the poor, women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities are often the hardest hit. This Training of Trainers Manual is designed to help build the capacity of trainers in flash flood risk management, who can then disseminate the knowledge to a larger number of practitioners. The manual presents an eight-day course including a three-day field trip. Detailed lesson plans for 21 sessions are followed by resource materials that will enable the trainers to replicate the course in their own work areas. Designed for participants with a basic knowledge of flash flood risk assessment and management, the manual focuses on developing understanding of the types, causes, and impacts of flash floods; flash flood hazards, vulnerability, risk assessment, and management methods; the role of local knowledge and gender perspectives in flash flood risk management; participatory social hazard mapping techniques; concepts and methods for an integrated approach to flash flood risk management; the full range of risk management measures for specific types of flash floods; legal and institutional aspects; and modelling tools. It is hoped that the publication will contribute meaningfully towards reducing disaster risk and providing greater physical security for the people of this vulnerable region.

eldis:A25262;Worker displacement during the transition : experience from Slovenia;;"At 3 to 4 percent a year, the displacement rate for the Slovenian labor force in 1990 93 was higher than that for the North American labor force during a major recession in the 1980s. But patterns of displacement were similar.Unusually rich administrative data sets covering both firms and workers enabled Orazem, Vodopivec, and Wu to study displacement in Slovenia during 1987  93.They describe displacement trends and the characteristics of displaced workers, comparing them to those in North America during a major recession. They analyze the determinants of displacement in the framework of labor turnover, and explore factors associated with post displacement wage losses. Among their findings:A comparison of displacement in Slovenia in 1990-93 and in North America during the recession of the early 1980s shows striking similarities in the incidence of displacement by gender and industry, as well as in reemployment paths. Workers try to avoid displacement both by switching to another job and by leaving the labor force. Before becoming displaced, they also take wage cuts. Both the probability of displacement and the probability of job quits are negatively correlated with tenure. Women are no more likely to be displaced than men, and face smaller post displacement wage losses. Non Slovenians are no more likely to be displaced than Slovenians, and face equal wage losses. Firm characteristics matter. The smaller and less profitable the firm, the greater the likelihood of both displacement and job switching. Restructuring subsidies that lower firm layoff costs increase the number of firm and worker initiated transitions. About half the displaced workers who find new jobs change occupations and about a third change industry. Only about a third of workers displaced in 1990 had found a job by the end of 1991. Surprisingly, for more than 68 percent of them, wage growth exceeded the median wage growth in the economy (17 percent).Those not reemployed seem to be paying a heavy toll: Not only do they stay unemployed much longer, but they face much lower reemployment wages.As studies of displacement in the United States also show, greater job experience is associated with heavier post displacement wage losses. The magnitude of those losses is consistent with findings about U.S. wage losses.This paper --- a product of the Transition Economics Division, Policy Research Department --- is part of a larger effort in the department to investigate how labor markets work during the transition. The study was funded by the Bank's Research Support Budget under the research project ""Labor Market Dynamics during the Transition of a Socialist Economy"" (RPO 67720).

It determined chemical fertility levels (fertility indicators) in the composite topsoil samples from 5 woman-owned plots and 5 man-owned plots in Ntanzi village, Uganda, on a Rhodic Ferralsol.  A similar study was conducted on 8 woman-owned and 8 man-owned plots in Buggala Island, Uganda, on a Ferralic Arenosol.  In total, the researchers took topsoil samples from 13 male-headed households, and sampled by horizon 13 soil profiles. No female-headed households (FHHs) were included in this study. Therefore when the report uses the words “women” or “female” it is referring to married women/females in male-headed households.The study showed no statistical significant difference between soil fertility indicators of plots owned by wives vs husbands.  The soil data from wives’ and husbands’ plots had low soil fertility levels of most soil fertility indicators, implying that they had been under comparable poor management practices. On-farm demonstrations of soil nutrient management options are recommended to convince both women and men farmers about the benefits of improved soil fertility technologies.This report is part of a special issue of African Studies Quarterly addressing the issue of gender and soil infertility in Africa ;"P.

PSP is a participatory planning method presented as a comprehensive, yet cost-effective approach to identifying: drivers of deforestation and forest degradation; interventions to address these drivers; environmental and social benefits/risks of these interventions; and indicators and monitoring plans.

The PSP methods are outputs of the project ‘Delivering Multiple Benefits from REDD+ in Southeast Asia’ (MB-REDD), implemented by SNV Netherlands Development Organisation. The report states that the methodology is generic and could be applied to any multi stakeholder land use planning process attempting to achieve a triple bottom line of economic, environmental and social returns.

Home countries are those which are ""home"" to companies either registered or raising capital within their jurisdictions. For this report, ten home countries were ranked on the four areas of : (1) requirements for disclosure of revenue payments, (2) requirements for disclosure of supportive financial information, (3)access to information legislation, and (3) broader governance.Findings of the report include:there was disappointing performance from countries with existing commitments to transparency, as for example an absence of requirements for country-level disclosure, meaning that citizens from host countries are unable to find out what revenues their governments have received from extractive companiesleadership on disclosure requirements comes from a non-EITI country, namely Canada leadership on access to information also comes from a non-EITI country, namely South Africa as well as the harmonisation of international accounting standards, there are also moves towards harmonisation of securities regulations at the European level, i.e. EC Directive 2001/34/EC and amendments via the ""Prospectus Directive"" and the ""Transparency Directive"" however, the disclosure power of securities regulations is often diluted by various relaxation or exemption clausesmany countries reported a lack of co-ordination between different government departments about disclosure commitments in the extractive sector.The report also offers a number of recommendations:Home governments should seize the opportunity of reforms in financial regulations to ensure that companies operating within their jurisdiction publish what they pay to governments in all the countries in which they operate all regulators involved in convergence should focus on a ""race to the top"" in standards rather than any lapse into the lowest common denominator where existing accounting standards provide ""grey areas"" on scope for publishing of revenue payments, these need to be utilised by companies, NGOs and investors access to information legislation should cover information held by the private sector, as this would potentially allow a citizen to request and get information about payments made by companies to host governments.

Ancestrors of Untouchables        remain in their ancestral land at the margin of the village, whereas    ancestors of high castes leave for the abode of ancestors, after        expiating their sins by transferring them to Untouchables. Since land became a saleable commodity during the nineteenth century, many high caste people became the owners of marginal lands. This trend culminated in land reforms, which officially turned the ""landless agricultural labourers"" in to landowners. From the point of view of  the Untouchables, however, they lost their ancestral land as a result  of the land reforms. In this paper I describe how Untouchables invoke the power of their ancestor spirits who are believed to be still ""sitting"" in kaavus (""groves"") in the margins of the village. I then discuss why the performance of ancestor worship turns into resistance to the encroachment of the marginal lands by the high caste. I argue that the Untouchables' performance of ancestor worship in the margins of the village re-creates symbolic boundaries that separate a purer centre and impure and dangerous marginal places. Some high caste landowners left the marginal land, for they feared the dangerous      power accumulated in the marginal places was activated by the        performance of ancestor worship in the kaavus (""groves"").

Customary laws that were effective means of ensuring sound use of grazing reserves are weakened by the creation of incompatible administration system and recurrent droughttransformation in government support of pastoral natural resource management is an essential component of sound pastoral natural resource management and this needs to devolve decision-making responsibility to grassroots indigenous institutionsintra-community conflicts of the Afar heightened with a change in land use system from nomadic pastoralism to settled agriculture. These conflicts, however, have been declining, which is mainly due to the increased economic interdependence and crosscutting ties as well as the growing power balance between the two communities the Afar have local assemblies through which inter-clan conflicts are sorted out and thoroughly addressed. Together with highland communities, they have also acquired a long-standing tradition of settling inter-community disputes through a joint institution these traditional dispute settlement mechanisms have symbiotic relations with modern governmental administrative and legal machinerya merger and further integration of the traditional and the modern systems is recommendedNGOs and development agents can also play a pivotal role by creating a conducive environment for inter-community socio-economic integration through community based development interventions.

eldis:A33348;Has land reform changed land ownership concentration?;;Possession of vast lands is a major representation of wealth in the Philippines - a privilege enjoyed largely by the ruling class since the colonial era. This ownership of huge tracts of land has resulted in numerous political, social, and economic inequalities. This edition of Development Research News addresses these disparities. The authors argue that the cause of failed land reform policies lies in the authorities having ignored the evasion tactics of landowners. These tactics have enabled them to avoid the redistribution of their lands to small farmers. Rather than seeking to erase the social injustices associated with land ownership, it is argued that, in many instances, this highly politicised land reform has only propagated the cycle of rural poverty and economic stagnation, and, consequently, social unrest.While advocating for improved monitoring and controlling of evasion, equally crucial to the authors is examining the reasons why farmer beneficiaries of land reform are increasingly selling or mortgagingthe lands awarded to them. ;;;Philippine Institute for Development Studies ;eldis;01/01/2007;en;"land;land registration;land tenure;land reform;land ownership";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;PHL";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A33348;http://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/drn/pidsdrn07-2.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdirp4.pids.gov.ph%2Fris%2Fdrn%2Fpidsdrn07-2.pdf;;;;"Land registration;politicisation;Phillipines;deeds;titling;Governance;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;titles;Ownership;politics;rural;concentration;land reform"
eldis:A18635;Water resources as a source of conflicts in Central Asia;;"This paper analyses the problem of water resource sharing in Central Asia. The authors consider this problem to be especially important, since they believe that the struggle for control over water resources will be one of the main causes of internal and international conflicts in the 21st century.[The full text of this paper is in Russian language only.]The authors note that in each of the Central Asian republics, the amount of water consumption rises, while the amount of water reserves decreases. The reasons for this are believed to be as follows:very large scale cotton agriculture in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan established in the Soviet periodlittle attention paid to the renewal of water resources (which led to the near disappearance of the Aral sea)massive and inefficient irrigationAccording to the authors, the distribution of water resources in the region is characterized as follows:Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are the countries with the greatest per capita water reservesTajikistan has the greatest number of lakes in the Amudarya basina large number of rivers originate in mountains on Tajikistan’s territory, then flow into neighboring statesboth Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have a very large potential for the development of hydroelectric power production, but are dependent on natural gas supplied by neighboring UzbekistanThe paper identifies the following regional tensions over the use of water resources:the greatest level of tensions was caused by the increase in Uzbekistan's gas export prices that led to greater energy consumption in Kyrgyzstan, an increase in the production of electricity at the Toktogul power plant, and a smaller volume of the Naryn river reaching Uzbekistanthe desire of Uzbekistan to become the regional center of political power led it to pressure Tajikistan, increasing the price of gas exported to Tajikistan; the latter country retaliated with a number of canal projects that cut Uzbekistan’s water supply certain tensions also exist between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on usage of the Amudarya riverThe authors conclude that the prevention of conflicts requires a common policy effort by all Central Asian states.

eldis:A35480;Monitoring land cover dynamics in sub-saharan Africa;;"Over the last 25 years civil disturbances, drought, population increases and global market pressures have all contributed in direct and indirect ways to a modification of Sub saharan African land cover.  
This study uses satellite data to assess the land cover change that has taken place between 1975 and 2000 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study shows that Africa has lost 16% of its forests and 5% of its woodlands and grasslands over the 1975 to 2000 period, equating to over 50,000 square km per year of natural vegetation. The majority of this has been converted to agricultural lands. Main findings include: 

    the agricultural domain is more crowded than 25 years ago – the on-going dynamic can lead to environmental refugees and conflict 
    the role of protected areas is even more crucial than ever – but they are becoming more isolated and vulnerable 
    climate change scenarios point to a worsening situation. 

Main recommendations for development include: 

    a priority of rural development policy should be oriented to increase yields through an intensification of agriculture and integration with animal husbandry 
    activities related to the adaptation to climate change should be concentrated in the most sensitive areas 
     development policy needs to address the drivers of conflict – amongst which available land and access to natural resources figure strongly 
     to ensure that environmental sustainability can be achieved, ‘environmental and natural resource’ issues must be fully integrated into development policies and processes.

It engages the poorest private and communal forest landholders and, through conservation agreements, offers them annual per-hectare payments in return for maintaining forest cover. The programme was not designed to attract funds from the emerging international finance system for REDD+, but it has achieved many of the intended outcomes of REDD+ programmes and made a material contribution to Ecuador’s climate compatible development. Moreover, because of its straightforward design, the Socio Bosque programme can be replicated in other countries. This brief examines the motivations of the Socio Bosque programme, its structure, delivery and accomplishments, and what other countries can learn from Ecuador’s experience. ;J.

eldis:A45794;Men first: inheritance rights and women in rural China;;"For women in rural China, inheritance rights are often limited by traditional customs which give greater benefits to men. Although this is being challenged by new laws that recognise women’s legal rights, increased access for women to jobs and education, there is a big gap between legislation and reality.Research from
University College Chester analyses the transfer of resources between
generations within households and village communities in rural China, with
particular reference to Dongdatun, a village in the
north. Women’s access to family resources is limited by patriarchal inheritance
systems, which favour male family members. 
In Dongdatun,
as in many villages, recent years have seen a marked diversification of rural
livelihoods, a rapid growth of rural industry and a diversification of
ownership structures. However, changing economic conditions caused by the ending
of rural communes has reduced rural people’s security. In the absence of state
or collectively financed social security, needs that are met by social welfare
services in China’s cities are still perceived as the responsibility of
individuals in rural areas.
In rural
societies, the focus of women’s lives is their husbands’ families, due to the
persistence of ‘patrilocal marriage’, in which a
woman moves into her husband’s village at marriage. Daughters leave their natal
(birth) families, but sons stay put. This means rural people continue to rely
on sons for security and support in ill health or retirement.
Evidence from
interviews with village women showed that:

Most women do not have the
same inheritance rights as their brothers nor do they try to claim them.
Many women still believe
that a ‘virtuous woman’ should not assert her own interests in the home
and should avoid household disputes through tolerance and unselfishness. 
Traditional beliefs are so
strongly held that many women also have negative attitudes towards
daughters’ inheritance rights. 

This
situation appears to be changing, however. Improved opportunities for women to
have paid jobs, education and training have increased their confidence and
bargaining power in the transfer and redistribution of resources within the
household. Young village women defend the legitimacy of ‘uxorilocal’
marriage, in which the husband lives with his wife’s family. More married
daughters now stay on in their natal households. The question of rural women’s
inheritance rights – particularly married women’s’ inheritance to parental estates
and remarried widows’ inheritance rights in their previous married families –
is now discussed more openly.
A lack of
similar legal mechanisms for old-age security, combined with the persistence of
patrilocal marriage, has reinforced the tradition of passing resources onto
sons, the denial of daughters’ inheritance rights and the need for families to
provide security for the elderly. However, the traditional security of extended
and close family structures is now under threat from rural industrialisation,
population mobility and family planning laws.
To protect
older people and encourage stronger rights for women, the Chinese authorities
should:

accept that the lack of a
basic system of social security has reinforced constraints on women’s
rights to inherit, their power in the family and society, as well as their
citizenship rights
recognise that the state has
an active role to play in extending rural social security programmes - to
promote welfare for all, especially women
challenge patriarchal practices in order to
realise equal inheritance rights for men and women in rural China.

The unfairness of the differences between traditional
rights of men and women will only change with effective social policies that
combat gender discrimination and exclusion.

eldis:A70466;Mainstreaming anti-corruption initiatives: development of a water sector strategy in Mozambique;;"Sector approaches to combating corruption have gained momentum in recent years, yet the strategic prioritization of sector anti-corruption initiatives is still the exception. The National Water Directorate in Mozambique is one of the few public sector departments in the world known to have allocated its own resources to developing a sector-specific anti-corruption strategy. Its experience offers valuable lessons for others considering integrating anti-corruption in sectors. Leadership needs to come from ministries with intersectoral mandates or through formal collaboration between different ministries. Government-led processes must be complemented by locally driven social accountability processes. Sector strategies need strong political commitment, at sector and central government levels, since multi-stakeholder processes are complex and time-consuming, and the implementation of sector strategies must include sector-level human resources and management systems.

eldis:A27132;Poverty and Environment: Turning the Poor into Agents of Environmental  Regeneration;;"The poor adapt and learn to live with poverty in a variety of ways. They also try to cope with shocks from events such as droughts, floods and loss of employment. Environmental resources play a vital role in their survival strategies. As the poor depend on environmental resources, one can expect them to have a stake in their preservation. Much of the damage done to natural resources is by others. Thus deforestation is much more an outcome of commercial logging for timber than fuelwood gathering by the poor. Well-meaning development projects, planned without a proper understanding of their ecological consequence have sometimes adversely affected natural resources on which the poor depend. Many development activities also adversely affect natural  resources.  Degradation of natural resources from whatever causes can have a high human cost for the poor. It can put a severe burden on their ability to meet their needs, can destroy their means of livelihood and can reduce their options to take defensive actions when faced with adversity such as crop failures. Thus, preservation and even regeneration of natural resources are needed for protecting and helping the poor. Environmental preservation may be a luxury for the rich; it is a bare necessity for the poor. It should therefore, be possible to make the poor agents of environmental regeneration in ways that also alleviate poverty. What institutional arrangements and innovations are needed to do this? In what ways should the approach to development change? How has UNDP's efforts in sustainable human development helped the poor and improved the environmental and natural resources? What are the lessons to be learnt from UNDP's experience? To explore these questions the paper first examines poverty and environmental interactions and how important they are. Thus it is observed that environmental income is critical for the poor. The poor obtain a substantial part of their consumption from natural and community resources. For example, in India and Bangladesh the poor obtain around 20 per cent of their income from ecological resources. And of course some 300 million indigenous people in the world obtain almost all of their consumption from ecological resources. The poor who depend on the environmental resources do not willfully destroy them. And yet common property resources (CPRs) have degraded in most countries. There are many forces that lead to extraction from CPRs beyond their natural regeneration rates. Often communities do rise to the challenge and evolve rules to protect the CPRs. But of course such evolution may not be feasible if appropriate institutions, clear property rights and technological availability are not there. Even when the natural resources upon which the poor depend are maintained and they are able to get ample fuel, fodder, fish, etc. from them, the poor can be victims of air and water pollution. It is estimated that in 1996 globally 2.2 million persons died prematurely due to indoor air pollution and        0.51 million due to outdoor air pollution.  Improving urban air quality can relieve the poor of this burden of diseases and deaths. The impact of water pollution on the poor is equally, if not more severe. 1.4 billion persons in developing countries lack access to safe water and 2.9 billion have no access to adequate sanitation. The World  Health Organization (WHO) estimates 17 million deaths a year from infectious diseases. What is important to note is that with feasible environmental action significant reduction in the deaths and diseases is possible. These suggest that important actions that can reduce poverty and improve the environment include improving the extent and productivity of CPRs, promoting sustainable management of natural resources, establishing institutional structures that create incentives for appropriate behavior to use CPRs in sustainable ways, increasing productivity of public and private land, reducing air pollution, providing cleaner domestic fuels, providing clear water and adequate sanitation, improving solid waste management and reducing chemical pollution.  UNDP projects have promoted many such actions. Many UNDP projects have sought to improve  the environment and help the poor by improving the productivity of their own assets such as land, by enlarging and improving natural environmental resources including by improving the quality of air and water, and by providing sanitation and solid waste disposal facilities. All of these can increase the entitlements they can derive from the environment as well as the income they can generate from activities in the market. UNDP has also recognized the importance of stakeholder participation, of many small beginnings and of capacity building.  The paper reviews some of these projects and their impacts. These projects seem to be, in general,  reasonably successful in attaining their goals. They also create widespread awareness of problems of sustainable development. And they create a feeling of self-reliance.Yet it is not possible to answer some very important questions. By how much have the consumption (including that of public goods and environmental services) of the poor really  improved? Was the improvement commensurate with the expenditure incurred? Unfortunately some   difficulties prevent us from answering these questions [author] ";K.S.

eldis:A28690;Property rights, collective action and technologies for natural resource management: a conceptual framework;;Explores how the institutions of property rights and collective action play a particularly important role in the application of technologies for agricultural and natural resource management.Technologies with long time frames tend to require tenure security to provide sufficient incentives for adoption, while those that operate on a large spatial scale will require collective action to coordinate. The conceptual framework presented in this paper shows how property rights and collective action interact with many other constraints to technology development, and is a guide for researchers and policymakers.The topics addressed in this paper are:factors influencing technology choicesthe indirect effects of technology adoptiontechnology, property rights and collective actionthe implications for efficiency, equity and environmental sustainabilityPolicy implications include: Strengthening local institutions of property rights and collective action increases the probability that people will use many of the new technologies for resource management. However, no single property regime is most appropriate for a particular technology in every instance. Even if it were, simply passing laws specifying the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups, or government agencies is not enough, unless effective institutions exist to monitor and enforce those rights. Local law derived from a number of sources may have an equal or greater influence on actual behavior. The evolution of property rights must be understood as a process of institutional change, in which resource users themselves play an active roleCollective action cannot be dictated by outsiders. However, policies such as employing a cadre of institutional organizers have been effective in fostering local organizations for voluntary resource management activities. In Namibia, an organizng partnership of communities, non governmental organizations (NGOs), and the Ministry of Tourism and the Environment established participatory mapping systems and other institutions to jointly manage wildlife re sources. These organizers, who may work for an NGO, university, or government agency, spend time in communities encouraging local participation in both direct activities and in decision making about the structure of collective action. This approach has shown high returns in terms of adoption and sustainability of resource management practicesProperty rights over natural resources can provide an important policy tool for strengthening collective action in their management. Just as individuals are unlikely to invest in technologies unless they have secure tenure, communities can not be expected to adopt long- term practices if they lack long-term rights to the resource. Yet many governments have been unwilling to transfer rights to water, irrigation infrastructure, range lands, or forests when they devolve management responsibility to user groups. The issues of community rights and ways of creating new common property resources (in place of government ownership) are emerging as critical issues in devolution programs.A  shorter, policy-maker focused version of this paper is also available in both English and Spanish ;"A.

eldis:A70078;Illegal sand mining in South Africa;;"Natural sand from estuary and coastal land is one of South Africa’s most valuable resources. However, there has recently been a drastic increase in uncontrolled and unauthorised sand mining activities in rivers, valleys and estuaries throughout the country. The frameworks governing small-scale sand mining in South Africa lack the necessary financial and human resource capacities to support better environmental compliance, and the enforcement mechanisms to successfully deter illegal activities are weak. Consequently, there has been a flurry of new entrants to the sector, creating a system fraught with social, environmental, legislative and structural challenges. Although the cumulative impact of these illegal activities is yet to be fully determined, existing policy and management responses do not have the urgency required to prevent the irreversible destruction of riverbeds and associated estuarine zones.

Recommendations include:


	an evaluation of the cumulative impact of sand mining in a given environment should inform the decision to mine sand. Permits should be granted with due consideration to extraction limits and the natural sediment yield of the river system
	illegal mines should be closed immediately, and estuary and riparian sand mining should be halted. Sand supplies must be obtained elsewhere, eg, by seeking more sustainable, nonriparian mining and dredging marine deposits
	further clarity is needed on the extent to which sand mining
	is subject to environmental regulation. The lack of
	independent oversight should be addressed and the extent of the DEA’s appellate authority clarified
	it is essential to enhance the capacity of national and
	provincial EMIs to curb illegal mining and carry out
	compliance assessments. Proper implementation and enforcement of EMPs should be prioritised,
	including in relation to the inspection of environmental
	authorisations and waste licences

eldis:A28695;Is there scope for growth with equity?: the case of land reform in South Africa;;Development economists have long aimed to identify programs and policies that can, by simultaneously improving equity and efficiency, foster sustainable growth. Land reform provides a classical example for such a programme. However, fears of not being able to achieve equity objectives has lead South African authorities to impose a number of restrictions that have arguably slowed program implementation and limited its outreach.This article use evidence from a survey of about 1,200 South African land reform beneficiaries to argue that such fears were exaggerated and that there is no conflict between efficiency and equity goals. Economically viable projects were oriented more towards the poor than unprofitable ones and characteristics of such projects are used to identify changes in program rulesto combine economic viability with equity, speed up implementation, and thereby contribute to the transformation that will be needed if rural South Africa is to deal successfully with the challenges of the 21 st century.Policy recommendations:A land reform programme that is more clearly focused on the goal of economic viability, with a minimum equity criterion, could make a significant contribution to overcoming rural poverty in South Africa Greater participation by the private sector, more scope for participation and 'ownership' by beneficiaries, communities, and local governments, and adoption of more flexible institutional arrangements for production and internal management of the beneficiary group are required transparency, and accountability at the local level will be critical to dispel fears that land reform is just another means of political favoritism, rather than an instrument to transform the rural sectorIn addition to having private financial intermediaries carry a real credit risk, greater involvement of civil society at large to ensure that the programme is not driven by landlords, as well as a stronger focus on capacity building at the community level, seem necessary to ensure that the programme will be sustainable in the long termThe elimination of barriers within the land rental market, through reform based on a 'community-based' approach, linked with the collection or even increases in the rate of a land tax (which could provide financing for a programme of land redistribution) is likely to provide far greater benefits to the poor than what has been possible through a programme of purely redistributive land reformIn all of these instances, the challenge is to move towards an understanding of land reform as a process that aims to empower the poor, improve productivity, and create sustainable rural livelihoods, rather than just redistributing a certain number of hectares of land.

eldis:A37768;Improving land access for India's rural poor;;"Since Independence, India’s states have employed several land reform ‘tools,’ including reforming tenancy, imposing land ceilings, distributing government wasteland, and allocating house sites and homestead plots. This article briefly summarises some of these past efforts and attempts to draw broad lessons for informing possible policy paths ahead.To date, the authors argue, the effectiveness of the legislation has been mixed and progress over the last few years has slowed. But the link between rural poverty and landlessness remains. A well-considered plan for rethinking and reforming policies and laws in a manner that advances the interests of the poor should lead India’s agenda. The plan can be both pro-poor and market friendly, and the required costs are not unthinkable.In order for the original equitable objectives of India’s land reform legislation to be achieved, the authors call for a fresh approach to land legislation which involves selected revision to existing legislation and adoption of new methods of increasing land access. The authors suggest the following measures as part of this approach:

    revitalise tenancy reform by (1) solidifying the gains of past tenancy reform by converting protected tenants into owners; and (2) selectively liberalising excessive tenancy regulation and restrictions
    assist beneficiaries of ceiling legislation in realising the benefits by removing obstacles to land distribution and relaxing moratoriums on the transfer of ceiling-surplus land
    consider adopting the decentralised Indira Kranthi Patham (formerly Velugu) project approach in Andhra Pradesh as a model for solidifying the gains of past wasteland allocation and otherwise providing secure land rights to the poor
    explore using land purchase and existing government land to create new colonies of one-tenth acre house-and-garden plots for distribution to landless labourers

eldis:A21904;Kinship, transaction costs and land rental market participation;;With land being the main source of income for many people in the developing world, security of access or ownership rights is imperative to the alleviation of rural povety. Past polices of  land redistribution, prohibition of land renting and later legalisation of short-term contracts only, may have prevented or undermined tenancy markets in Ethiopia. This paper examines the allocative efficiency of the land rental market in Northern Ethiopia, and the extent to which adjustment in the tenancy market is constrained by transaction costs. Attention is also paid to the extent to which kinship ties may influence and transaction costs.The main findings of this study include:tenants face lower access constraints in villages with high prevalence of kinship contractsthere is a large variation in the extent of participation in the land rental market across the 16 surveyed villagesvariation in local leadership may contribute to the local variation in how the market functionsadditional research should focus on explaining this variation and how new policies granting more secure rights and allowing more long-term leasing contracts may affect the efficiency of the land rental market, and the consequent impacts on land use efficiency and management. ;"S.

eldis:A58124;Gender, water and livelihoods in Mseleni: a case study;;"Access to sufficient water to meet basic needs has been identified as a critical development issue and a human right. This study set out to investigate the dynamic relationship between gender, water and livelihoods in a traditional, rural community in South Africa.The paper finds that: 

    access to a reliable, sufficient water supply increases the range of possible livelihood activities and has a ‘multiplier’ effect on livelihood outcomes
    poor water access results in health, opportunity and financial costs and furthermore, constrains livelihood activities; in particular agriculture
    the factors affecting access to and control over resources result in uneven accruement of the positive and negative water and livelihoods linkages
    these factors comprise inter and intra-household hierarchies: gender, age, social status and class
    in this respect, women and children are largely responsible for water collection and women for managing household water
    still, technology, transport and money are potential levers which can alter the social relations of access

Recommendations to enhance livelihoods and advance gender equity are:

    factoring livelihoods water uses into definitions of basic needs and humans rights, norms, standards, policies and programmes
    working towards a more nuanced understanding of power relations at household and community level which influence water access and livelihood outcomes
    the equitable roll-out of simple technologies, infrastructure and transport to deep rural areas in order to make water for livelihoods more accessible.

eldis:A29660;Land tenure reform and the balance of power in eastern and southern Africa;;This paper examines the current wave of land tenure reform in eastern and southern Africa. It discusses how far tenure reform reflects a shift in powers over property from centre to periphery. A central question is whether tenure reform is designed to deliver to rural smallholders greater security of tenure and greater control over the regulation and transfer of these rights.Policy conclusions include:whilst diverse in initial objective, and uneven in delivery, tenure reforms address a remarkably common set of concerns. Most embody significant shifts in the balance of power in state-people property relationsoverall, tenure reform incorporates new recognition of local level land rights and significant transfer of powers over their disposition nearer to the ordinary landholderat the same time, some authority over land is being concentrated more at the centre, amply illustrating the essentially political nature of property relations and the time-old reluctance of central governments to release powersnonetheless, intentionally or otherwise, governments are delivering to landholders new powers and rights in land which may enhance democratisation in this and related spheresthe manner in which customary, unregistered rights in land are being regarded in new tenure law represents the most crucial area of change and should yield an African character to property relations in the 21st century which has been determinedly denied throughout the 20th. ;L.

This report examines wages in the tea industry with a focus in three case study areas: Malawi, West Java (Indonesia) and Assam (India). It looks at hired labour on plantations and, in particular, tea pluckers. 

Researchers found a number of deep rooted and complex factors keeping wages low. A key problem is that pay is set for the whole sector - there is no difference in pay from one plantation to the next - and that it is pegged to the legal minimum wage which is often well below the level needed for meet a family's basic needs. Other issues include the huge variation in the quality and take up of 'in-kind' benefits such as childcare or housing and the fact that workers, particularly women who make up the majority of the workforce, have little say in negotiations over pay.

eldis:A65065;Media perceptions and portrayals of pastoralists in Kenya, India and China;;"Through the analysis of newspaper articles and a survey of journalists, this publication identifies gaps and highlights differences in how the media portray pastoralism in Kenya, China and India. In discussing their methodology, the authors note that their reliance on national, English-language publications meant that they were not able to include data from vernacular language press in pastoral regions.Although able to make significant contributions to food security, livelihoods and economic prosperity, the benefits of pastoralism often go unnoticed. The authors argue that this is in part due to an overly negative narrative about pastoralism within the media, one that portrays the livelihood as in some way bad and in need of change. The media coverage of pastoralists in the three countries can be summarised as follows.

    Kenya – Pastoralists are mostly featured in ‘bad news’ stories (often concerning drought or conflict) and are portrayed as vulnerable and lacking agency, with almost no mention of benefits.
    China – Presented as a cause of environmental degradation, pastoralists here are viewed as being happy beneficiaries of government investment and settlement projects.
    India – While viewed with more pity (with regard to loss of grazing rights and dwindling pastures), media coverage was rare; journalists responded that pastoralists are ‘invisible’ to news editors.

Having outlined the nature of the media portrayal of pastoralism, the paper then looks at what was missing from the media coverage.

    Pastoral voices, in particular the perspective of women and children, were absent from the majority of news articles (Kenya came out top with 41 per cent of articles featuring a pastoral voice).
    An adequate variety of voices was missing from all three countries. While the vast majority of Chinese articles quoted a government official (82 per cent) with civic groups barely represented (two per cent), this finding was reversed in India (15 per cent and >50 per cent).
    Very few mentions were made across the board regarding the economic importance of pastoralism, and in Kenya and India there was little discussion of government investment.
    Positive portrayals of mobility were rare; more common were narratives that saw mobility as a problem, despite the knowledge, skills and advantages inherent in such techniques.
    Climate change was roundly under-represented; and when it was highlighted, it was to show the vulnerability of pastoralists.

eldis:A28214;The Kyrgyz sheep herders at a crossroads;;Assessing the challenges facing the sheep herders in the Kyrgyz Republic, this paper concludes:for the first time in recent history the future of the sector may be in the hands of farmer/herders themselvesalthough there are many constraints in the production system, the government's attempts to promote decentralisation (e.g. through the Tax Collection in the Land Law of 1993) together with the fact that it is committed to privatising many parts of the sector are promisingthe herders themselves, in their search for reference points, appear to go back to traditional systems employed before the collectivisationmany of the present rural elite derive from the elite before communism, despite the fact that one generation was virtually wiped out during the 1920s and 1930s. The latter authors also noted that the privatisation effort can leave many herders somewhat confused and vulnerable, as previous safety nets (such as feed supply) break down without the establishment of market relations or new safety nets or disaster reliefthere have been counteracting moves by the leadership of some transformed collectives to semi-privatise, whereby the collective still holds the land, and contracts with the private herders. These contracts include binding land lease requirements as well as agreements which place the reformed collective in somewhat of a monopoly position with respect to supplying the herders and purchasing their output. It is likely that new social structures, such as cooperatives, will develop - but this will require time. As such, the coming years appear crucial in setting the stage for the livestock sector and for rural welfare in general in a society which depends traditionally on animal production.[From the author] ;T.W.

eldis:A34271;Mali mining and human rights: international fact-finding mission report;;"This paper analyses the reasons why Mali’s gold economy has failed to benefit the population despite its rapid growth and the boom in the gold market. It also explores the conflicts of interests between the State and the private mining companies in the country which arose from rules designed to attract foreign investment. 
The authors highlight how these conflicts and tax abatements have impoverished the State and deprived it of revenue which should be used to develop the country. They also discuss how the Malian state does not have the means to regulate or impose its regulations on the operating mining companies.
Recommendations include that:

    the Malian State should fulfill its obligations in the areas of respect, protection, and promotion of human rights 
    the mining companies operating in Mali should publish in their entirety figures concerning mine 
    the international financial institutions and other international donors to not induce the Malian State to create measures that favor foreign investment 
    the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights call for a task force on economic and social rights regarding labor in mining operations.

eldis:A19368;Land reform in South Africa:a 21st century perspective;;"This document investigates the concept of land reform in South Africa and argues that there is a need to redefine 'land reform' to take account of the realities of an urbanising, modernising, economy.  It analyses recent political developments on land issues and sheds light on the current process of land reform as well as agro-climatic, economic, budgetary constraints that impinge on the process. The authors come up with a number of broad conclusions bringing together political and practical realities related to the process :since coming to power in 1994, the democratic government has pursued land reform in a considered, reasonable, and largely market-oriented manner, firmly rooted in the constitutional settlement on property rights and in the recognition that the righting of past wrongs, while essential, should not be allowed to damage future prospects. In recent months, however, this perspective has been under increasing pressureAfrica’s commercial agricultural sector is said to offer fewer and fewer opportunities for addressing unemployment, poverty, or inequality on a significant scale. White South Africans are moving out of farming because it is hard to make a reasonable living. Caution must therefore be taken not to set up poorer black South Africans for failure.the deracialisation of commercial agricultural land is essential, but will not benefit primarily poor black South Africans; the benefits will mainly accrue to a small number of relatively better-off black land owners and potential farmers. the government is struggling to meet its own political and developmental objectives with respect to land reform. In the process, it is raising expectations it cannot meetland quality and location is more important than quantity. There is a need to understand that what you do with land is most importantrural land reform is difficult, slow, and expensive, and many black South Africans do not want land to farm.the main focus of land reform should not be rural, except in identified areas of high demand for farm land. Urban and peri-urban land redistribution is the main future challenge.The study identifies three ‘priority areas’ for land reform:concluding the restitution process as speedily and effectively as possible, encouraging forms of compensation other than farmlandspeeding up urban land release for settlement and the delivery of low-income urban and peri-urban housingde-racialising the ownership of commercial agricultural land, and ‘normalising’ the countrysideThe report calls for the formation of a high-level private sector task team to liaise with policy-makers, and help maximise the contribution of the private sector to land reform.

eldis:A30072;Extractive Sectors and the Poor;;"This paper examines how states that rely on oil and mineral exports address the concerns of the poor. Its central finding is that oil and mineral dependence are strongly associated with unusually bad conditions for the poor. To explain this link, it draws on both original econometric analyses, and recent academic studies.Some of its key findings are:Overall living standards in oil and mineral dependent states are exceptionally low; lower than they should be given their per capita incomes;Higher levels of mineral dependence are strongly correlated with higher poverty rates;Oil and mineral dependent states tend to suffer from exceptionally high rates of child mortality and low life expectancy.Oil dependence (though not mineral dependence) is also associated with high rates of child malnutrition; low spending levels on health care; low enrollment rates in primary and secondary schools; and low rates of adult literacy; Mineral dependence is strongly correlated with income inequality;Both oil and mineral dependent states are exceptionally vulnerable to economic shocks.A set of problems like this might normally lead to calls for government action. But the paper also find that oil and mineral dependence has a harmful effect on governments themselves. Oil and mineral dependent states tend to suffer from unusually high rates of:Corruption;Authoritarian government;Government ineffectiveness;Military spending;Civil war.To address these problems, Oxfam calls for:Oil and mineral dependent states to diversify their economies; and for the World Bank Group and the OECD states to take measures to help this process;Full disclosure of all financial transactions between extractive firms and host governments;International funders to only offer extractive sector assistance to states that have become democratic, and have demonstrated a commitment to fighting poverty;International funders to only support projects in which the host government specifies in advance how the resource revenues are to be used to alleviate poverty, and agrees to independent monitoring to ensure that this occurs.[authors abstract] ";M.

eldis:A10599;Limiting livestock pressure on public rangeland in Niger;;The present paper is based on a participatory survey carried out in order to establish baseline information on a little known livestock production system and its role in local ecology and economy.The study is based on research in El Kala National Park (North East Algeria).This paper draws attention to some of the problems that arise in understanding the cost and benefit flows in pastoralist systems. These difficulties arise as a result not just of the ecological variability but also as a result of social and political complexities common to the regional contexts of many pastoralist systems.The article finds that:the productivity and efficiency of the system has been seriously underrated, as is frequently the case with pastoraliststhe production system is underpinned by conservation-compatible use of the ‘free services’ of the National Park grazing and water, making livestock production in El Kala a low-cost, high-return enterprisepastoralist land use in the National Park promotes natural vegetation formations and a pleasing ‘natural’ landscape compatible with maintaining wildlife populations, and avoids fencing, clearing and the introduction of exotic species or chemicalsthe environmental benefits of the El Kala livestock system lie in its complementary use of resources essential to wildlife survival and not least in its added justification of their continued maintenancethe pastoralist system operates a flexible and mobile response not merely to patchiness in rangeland conditions but also to patches of political and economic opportunitylivestock here represent a moveable and easily-traded asset as well as an investment that grows at a reasonable rate of return. They provide not only a hedge against inflation but a potential bolthole in times of economic collapsewhile individuals can migrate to work in the towns, they can invest their earnings in livestock. The indications are that when they can no longer find jobs in the weakening urban economy, they can return to the livestock production systempastoralism has has the potential to accommodate fluid urban to rural populations by shifting to and fro along the continuum between milk-based, labour intensive, and largely self-sufficient production, to a more market-oriented,  eat-exporting, relatively low-labour enterprise, without much change in external appearances ;G.

eldis:A21264;Land reform and food security issues in Angola and South Africa;;Effective and well-designed land reform policies can provide sustained contributions to economic growth, reduced social unrest and poverty. This study analyses land reform policies in Angola and South Africa with a view to assess its impact on food security. Both countries have introduced extensive land reform policies following histories of colonialism, occupation and oppression which displaced many people.The paper begins with a background of South Africa and Angola and discusses the governments’ land reform policies. In South Africa, land reform was a key promise made by the African National Congress (ANC) when it gained power in 1994. The main intention of this promise was to reimburse the victims of apartheid oppression. In the Republic of Angola the government’s land reform policies are part of its strategy to rebuild the agricultural sector following civil war. Following on from this analysis, the nature of the agricultural sector in the two countries is discussed in terms of working conditions, employment, wages etc. Finally, the author assesses the extent of progress that the countries have made in implementing their land reform policies, and discusses the implication of this on food security.Findings include:in South Africa, land reform policies are aimed at facilitating the poor and disadvantaged in gaining access to landthe South African government also introduced policies that protect the rights of farm workers and their families living on the farmsimplementation of the land reform process has been hindered in South Africa by a lack of funds available to the government to purchase landin Angola, the government provided settlement for returnees and refugees as part of an agrarian policy to contribute to food securityfarm workers and their families are not effectively protected by legislation in Angola, and high levels of illiteracy puts farmers in a disadvantaged situation as they do not understand their rightsThe author concludes that in South Africa, land reform has no focus on the enhancement of food security. As a result, agricultural production of beneficiaries is still not sufficient to raise them out of poverty. In Angola, conversely, the government’s principle objective has been to promote the agricultural sector and almost 4 million people have benefited from the provision of land to start agricultural activities. ;A.

eldis:A17572;Gold Rush: The impact of gold mining on poor people in Obuasi in Ghana;;Report highlighting how poor communities in Obuasi, Ghana are suffering environmental pollution and social problems apparently as a result of gold mining activity. It examines how rivers and streams have been polluted with arsenic, iron, manganese and heavy metals from past gold mining activities by Anglo American’s subsidiary, AngloGold Ashanti (AGA) and its predecessor, Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (AGC).According to the report AGA is failing to report its activities accurately to shareholders and the public and some of these failures are serious. There are at least three areas in which evidence collected by this report contradicts claims made by AGA:on-going water contamination up to 38 times above maximum legal limits, environmental damage and toxic flooding affecting local food security in the Obuasi areadiscrepancies between AGA’s claims to have provided adequate compensation after a toxic spill and testimony by local witnessescompany claims that Awudu Mohammed, a suspected illegal miner, was not shot on 21 June 2005 are contradicted by evidence obtained by this reportThe report is calling for tougher domestic company laws worldwide and also for new international laws to regulate corporations and their subsidiaries to help ensure greater respect for peoples’ rights. The report argues that tougher reporting requirements and greater legal duties on directors of UK-listed companies to take steps to minimise any negative social and environmental impacts on communities overseas could help prevent some of the issues. The report also lists a number of specific recommendations for AngloGold Ashanti, the Ghana government and the UK government. ;;;ActionAid International;eldis;01/01/2006;en;"mining;extractive industries";;;"202;GHA";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A17572;http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/gold_rush.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.actionaid.org.uk%2Fdoc_lib%2Fgold_rush.pdf;;;;"Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;Gold;AngloGold Ashanti;Business and the environment;Extractive industries;AngloAmerican;Extractive industries mining"
eldis:A25310;The dynamics of poverty : why some people escape from poverty and others don't : an African case study;;"In urban areas of Cote d'Ivoire, human capital is the endowment that best explains welfare changes over time. In rural areas, physical capital especially the amount of land and farm equipment owned matters most.Empirical investigations of poverty in developing countries tend to focus on the incidence of poverty at a particular point in time. If the incidence of poverty increases, however, there is no information about how many new poor have joined the existing poor and how many people have escaped poverty.Yet this distinction is of crucial policy importance. The chronically poor may need programs to enhance their human and physical capital endowments. Invalids and the very old may need permanent (targeted) transfers. The temporarily poor, on the other hand, may best be helped with programs that complement their own resources and help them ""bridge"" a difficult period.Results from analyses of panel surveys show significant mobility into and out of poverty and reveal a dynamism of the poor that policy should stimulate. Understanding what separates chronic from temporary poverty requires knowing which characteristics differentiate those who escape poverty from those who don't.In earlier work, Grootaert, Kanbur, and Oh found that region of residence and socioeconomic status were important factors. In this paper they investigate the role of other household characteristics, especially such asset endowments as human and physical capital, in the case of Cote d'Ivoire.In urban areas of Cote d'Ivoire, human capital is the most important endowment explaining welfare changes over time. Households with well educated members suffered less loss of welfare than other households. What seems to have mattered, though, is the skills learned through education, not the diplomas obtained. Diplomas may even have worked against some households in having oriented workers too much toward a formal labor market in a time when employment growth came almost entirely from small enterprises.In rural areas, physical capital especially the amount of land and farm equipment owned mattered most. Smallholders were more likely to suffer welfare declines. Households with diversified sources of income managed better, especially if they had an important source of non farm income.In both rural and urban areas, larger households suffered greater declines in welfare and households that got larger were unable to increase income enough to maintain their former welfare level.Households whose heads worked in the public sector maintained welfare better than other households, a finding that confirms earlier observations. The results also suggest that government policies toward certain regions or types of household can outweigh the effects of household endowments.Surprisingly, migrant non Ivorian households tended to be better at preventing welfare losses than Ivorian households, while households headed by women did better than those headed by men (after controlling for differences in or changes in endowment).The implications for policy makers? First, education is associated with higher welfare levels and helps people cope better with economic decline. Second, targeting the social safety net to larger households possibly through the schools, to reach children is justified in periods of decline. Third, smallholders might be targeted in rural areas, and ways found to encourage diversification of income there.This paper, a joint product of the Social Policy and Resettlement Division, Environment Department, and the Africa Regional Office, Office of the Chief Economist, is the result of a research project on ""The Dynamics of Poverty: Why Some People Escape Poverty and Others Don't, A Panel Analysis for Cootie d'Ivoire"" (RPO 67870).

eldis:A26514;Paradigm Case Illustrations of Incremental Cost Analysis;;"The application of the incremental cost assessment to biodiversity has always been uncertain. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the concept is a workable one in biodiversity. This paper has a twofold aim:1. to make explicit the strategic and logical approach to incremental cost assessment- to demonstrate that it is replicable and applicable to all GEF projects2. to apply this strategic and logical approach to specific case examples (or paradigm cases)
- these paradigms will provide operational guidance at the more practical level
Most GEF projects to date have been conservation type projects, more amenable to rapid incremental cost procedures than to full treatment, and we have not been able to find good project examples where full incremental cost assessment has been demonstrated well. We are still finalizing some case studies for consideration and dissemination. In the meanwhile, we are presenting here some hypothetical paradigms which have been developed out of real cases. The paradigm cases represent different operational programs, and geographical regions and the data source for each could be (i) actual GEF projects; (ii) case studies; or (iii) hypothetical cases, based on experience.Case studies are:INSULAE PISCATORIAE: Provision of Fish Aggregation Devices to Protect a  Threatened and Unique Fish Family, the Piscus unicus: part of a larger project in the Comoros IslandsModerating the Impact of Veterinary Fences to the Wildlife and  Ecosystem of the Bos Delta: Okavango delta in Botswana Creation and Management of Biological Corridors between Protected  Areas  to Facilitate Biodiversity Conservation between Continental Land Masses, GautemalaIncorporating 'Indicator' Biodiversity Inventorying into Existing  Commercial Inventorying, MalasyiaReducing Forest Fragmentation to Protect the Biodiversity of the Peat  Swamp Forest, MalaysiaBiodiversity Conservation of the Titicaca-Desaguadero-Poopo- Salar De Coipasa (TDPS) Waterbasin, Peru / Bolivia ";"K Kumari

eldis:A70334;Myths and mining: the reality of resource governance in Africa;;"In Africa, mining activities are undertaken by private foreign entities, which pay taxes to the state. However, mining activities are not contributing as much as they should to national economies. Despite the increase in productivity and profits, the real benefits of mining have yet to be felt by the majority of the people, especially mining communities. Many factors – including the negotiation of dubious mining contracts by politicians with no real experience in the sector, keeping contracts secrets , lack of transparency by both mining companies and governments, tax evasion, transfer pricing and corruption – have contributed to reducing the amount of revenue that goes to governments and is therefore available to support critical socio-economic development programmes.

As this report argues, unsurprisingly, many people are asking how there can be two such conflicting realities. And in particular they are asking about the exploitation and export of the region’s mineral resources. They want to know what governments are doing with the revenues that they collect from the commercialisation of these minerals – and why natural riches do not seem to translate into a reduction in poverty. And another question that comes up time and again is – how have other nations managed to use their minerals to successfully build their societies and diversify their economies?

The author argues that it is clear that drastic changes are necessary – and that there is now a chance that real change can now happen. The African Mining Vision has finally produced a charter that all African countries can use to improve the governance of their natural resources – to start to transform the mining sector so that it benefits everyone not just foreign mining companies and local elites. But to achieve change, countries need to strengthen those institutions that are essential to controlling, directing and overseeing the mining sector. In particular, parliaments need to be given the skills and knowledge to perform their role better. It is not a ‘silver bullet’ since other work also needs to be done – to build capacity of civil society and local community groups, to root out corruption, to make companies adhere to international best practices – but boosting the ability of parliaments to oversee the mining sector would go a long way towards improving governance of this critical sector.

It outlines the history of environmental projects in the country and ways in which a lack of attention to conflict has prevented them from working.Its exposition of the history of resource management projects in Lesotho reveals that:attempts by both the British and post-colonial governments to manage land use were viewed as repression or infringement of rights by people in the villages who used the land later competition for limited resources manifested itself in conflict between neighbouring communities successive projects aimed at curbing soil erosion in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed because they were not supported by local farmers, and so were not maintained after the termination of the government intervention.Focussing on the National Environmental Youth Corps Project, a programme for environmental rehabilitation and management by unemployed youths set up in 1992, the article notes that this project appeared well-designed and ensured community participation.  But there were several problems: the selection of only 20 per cent of the villages’ youths to implement the project was a source of conflict, since the youths were paid an allowance for their work. These positions were highly sought after, as they were in areas experiencing high poverty and unemploymentalthough it was initially planned to transfer the rehabilitated land to the youth groups, village elders reneged on this plan once it had become apparent how valuable the (previously degraded and valueless) land had become the conflict within the village hindered its environmental impact; for instance, villagers drove animals over soil conservation structures built by the youth group, and village elders took no action to curb such behaviour in more than half the sites, the initial objectives of putting some of the rehabilitated lands back into production were never realised there was conflict between traditional village chiefs and elected members of Village Development Councils, which tended to be elected on political lines; ambiguity over which had the right to allocate land for environmental programmes divided villagers over whether to support or obstruct the programmes. The article concludes that planners, environmentalists and development agents need to be equipped with conflict management skills, and to take into account social conflicts such as those between traditional and elected leaders, when planning and implementing environment management problems.

eldis:A28075;Range degradation in Botswana: Myth or reality?;;Paper attempts to dispel some of the confusion surrounding the application of the range degradation concept in Botswana. It has three objectives. First, to present the current thinking of range ecologists vis-a-vis range degradation. Second, to dismiss recent arguments that range degradation in Botswana is insignificant. Third, to present an argument linking the livestock industry to ecosystem level degradation of the Kalahari.Conclusions:The concept of range degradation can be viewed from two angles: i) with respect to the output of a set of management-defined commodities, and ii) with respect to ecosystem processes. The argument that range degradation does not exist in Botswana was advanced primarily from the point of view of beef cattle production. It was based primarily on the fact that average carcass weights in 1966 and 1990 were the same. This in isolation would undermine the contention that the range has degraded over time. However, average stocking rate declined over the same period, animal health improved through better veterinary services, and access to markets was greatly facilitated over the 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Given the changes in those other variables, the slaughter and off-take rates could have no bearing on any shift in range condition. Therefore, from the standpoint of beef cattle production there is no support for the argument that Botswana's rangelands are not degraded.Ecologically important pockets of fertility in the region are maintained by the concentration of wild ungulate excreta within topographic depressions. Since veterinary cordon fences have been linked to the decimation of the Kalahari's wild ungulates, Botswana's livestock industry is responsible for the virtual cessation of the transfer of nutrients from the uplands to these pockets of fertility. This rupture of a fundamental ecosystem process should be viewed as range degradation at the landscape level.Paper does not prove that there is de facto degradation. Nonetheless, management decisions are invariably made in the absence of a complete and irrefutable body of knowledge. This is particularly true of ecosystem management. The assumption that all is well and nothing needs to be done about the ecological degradation of Botswana's rangelands has serious long-term consequences. Privatisation of the Kalahari would not reverse the ecologically unsustainable trend assailing the Central Kalahari. To restore the region's ecological integrity, it is necessary to re-establish migration routes and allow the wild ungulate populations to recover to numbers commensurate with their ecological role and economic utilisation. Only then will the Central Kalahari be able to play a significant role in ensuring that Botswana's development is sustainable.[From the author] ;J.S. de Queiroz;;Pastoral Development Network, ODI;eldis;01/01/1993;en;land degradation;Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"BWA;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A28075;http://www.odi.org.uk/pdn/papers/paper35b.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.odi.org.uk%2Fpdn%2Fpapers%2Fpaper35b.html;;;;"livestock;EADI;Animal production and health;pastoralism grazing and pasture;Pastoralism land use conflict;Agriculture and food;pastoralism;land degradation;Range management;Pastoralism"
eldis:A10878;Land restitution and redistribution: providing opportunities for broad-based rural development;;"This case study deals with the South African government policies for restitution and redistribution of land to people in rural areas who were deprived of it due to racially discriminatory laws and practice. Its main focus is on how the interactions between civil society and the state in the several phases of land reform through the 1990s reflect some key issues of governance, eg. as an undemocratic, racist government tries to put in place some guarantees of continued privilege for its constituency; as the same government buckles under pressure not to make any major policy decisions during the last stages of the transitional period; and as a democratically elected government committed to land reform tries to make its promises become reality but faces key challenges to its authority. The case study shows quite clearly that while resolution of the land issue is a central part of state construction under the new democratic situation, it is also a source of potential conflict in restructuring social authority. In short, the land question highlights, but does not necessarily resolve, the tension between social control and social incorporation that challenge any effort at state construction and nation-building.The study goes on to examine land reform issues throughout the recent history of democratisation in South Africa, highlighting key governmental attitudes and policies for undermining black people’s rights to land and create a pool of migrant, cheap labour during the various periods of the apartheid era. At the same time, it focus on the role of the different types of Civil Society Organisations in dealing with the issue, either challenging the unjust land distribution and advocating for the rights of the poor, or actually helping to increase these inequalities while pursuing, for example, the interests of farmers and other land owners’ groups. The pressure for solving the land issue would then become harder for the new democratic government when the international community comes on board to demand liberalisation policies in the land redistribution process. Many Civil Society Organisations argued that liberalisation would make it harder for poor people to afford land.Meanwhile, governmental and international empathy for traditional forms of public representation such as tribal leaderships had weakened considerably due to a new climate for promoting greater democracy and gender equality. While was necessary for the government to ensure that new mechanisms of public representation were put in place, the government itself has had to reassess internal management and stakeholder relationship issues in order to promote accountability and assume responsibility for creating greater social justice.The authors conclude that, while much remains to be done, the democratic government of South Africa since 1994 must be given credit for its enormous efforts to date to find workable and just solutions. Civil society also has to be applauded for its consistent engagement with government and communities in trying to offer technical advice and provide reality and conscience checks on all sides. ";"P.

eldis:A17692;Aspects of resource conflict in semi-arid Africa;;The present century has seen a significant real increase in resource conflict in semi-arid Africa. The most important causes of this are human population increase and the globalisation of the economy. Such conflicts reflect both point resources (mines, farms, reserves) and ecozonal conflicts (water, grazing and hunting rights). Although attempts to involve the community have been partially successful in relation to reserved land, conflict over extensive and patchy common property resources such as wetlands and grazing has made them more difficult to conserve and manage. ;R.

eldis:A16084;Land tenancy and efficiency of land use in the Highlands of Eritrea;;The paper tests two theoretical models that explain land productivity differentials between owner-tenants, owner-operators and owner-landlords, and between plots of land operated under different tenancy contracts by owner-tenants.The owner-tenants were richer in non-land resources than owner-operators and owner-landlords and the analysis showed that the land productivity followed the same pattern being highest for owner-tenants. This shows that the land rental market transfers land from less efficient to more efficient land users. However, the fact that productivity differentials persisted after participation in the land rental market indicates that there were significant transactions costs in this market.The report also tests a theory that tenure insecurity (threat of contract non-renewal) created incentives for more use of non-land resources on rented land relative to own land vs. the disincentive effect due to output sharing. It found that land productivity was higher on cost-shared land than on own land of cost-sharing tenants while land productivity on sharecropped land was not significantly different from on own land of share cropping tenants. This may indicate that tenants work harder on rented land to increase probability of contract renewal and this compensated for the disincentive effect of output sharing in sharecropping contracts.

eldis:A25528;What Drives Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon? Evidence from Satellite and Socioeconomic Data;;Road network expansion is strongly associated with increased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Pfaff analyzes the determinants of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Using a model of optimal land use, he derives and estimates an equation for deforestation using (1) country level data for 197888 and (2) measures of deforestation from satellite images.The evidence suggests that:  Increased road density in a county leads to more deforestation there and in neighboring counties.  Development projects were associated with deforestation in the 1970s but not in the 1980s.  The greater the distance from markets south of the Amazon, the less the deforestation.  Better soil quality leads to more deforestation.The model results for government provision of credit were mixed across specifications.Population density, the primary explanatory variable in most previous empirical work, was significant when it was the sole explanatory variable but was much less important when other variables were factored in.This paper - a product of the Environment, Infrastructure, and Agriculture Division, Policy Research Department - is part of the department's ongoing work on deforestation and changes in land use.

eldis:A21484;Can land registration serve poor and marginalised groups? summary report;;This report summarise the research findings of a project to examine the current processes of land rights registration in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Mozambique and assess their outcomes for poor and vulnerable groups. It examines the design and process of registration, the governance of those processes and the equity of the outcomes.This research finds that land registration is not inherently anti-poor in its impacts and that the distributional consequences of land registration depend on the design of the process and on the institutions responsible for its management. Land registration systems, the authors argue, can be designed so as to address the risk of bias against poorer and marginalised groups. To protect and secure the land rights of these groups, attention should be paid to:registration processes with regard to language used, registration fees, geographical accessibilityrecognising and recording “secondary” land rightsestablishing effective accountability and oversight mechanisms for the institutions implementing registration programmesinclusive dispute settlement institutionsThe study shows the need to avoid “one-size-fits-all” solutions and documents experience from a number of case studies from which the authors hope others will be able to learn.This report forms part of a series of seven papers based on a research programme entitled “Securing Land Rights in Africa: Can land registration serve the poor?” led by IIED. ;"N.

eldis:A39430;The status of rural poverty in the Near East and North Africa;;"Poverty in the Near East and North Africa region (NENA) is mainly a rural phenomenon. Almost half (48%) the area’s population lives in rural areas. This report focuses on key rural poverty issues in 13 diverse countries in the region, without attempting to propose policy or programme actions at national or local levels. Overall, the rural poor still face traditional constraints such as water scarcity, inadequate rural infrastructure, inappropriate policies and institutions, weak local-level organisations and gender inequity. They are also affected by new trends in migration, globalisation, changing trade patterns and increasing unemployment amongst young men and women.Conclusions on some of the areas covered include: 

    Hunger and food insecurity: the rate of reduction of malnutrition (amongst children) is slow and overall food insecurity is not improving 
    Private investment in rural enterprise is severely constrained by poor rural infrastructure, inadequate access to rural finance, insufficient availability of local skills and competition from Chinese low cost products 
    Access to/sustainability of natural resources such as water, land and pasture is rapidly deteriorating as a result of increasing population density and pressure. This scarcity is likely to be aggravated in coming years as a result of global warming and climate change 
    Rural infrastructure and social services: access to water and sanitation facilities is below the world average, however, there has been a lot of progress in the areas of health and education 
    Conflict and adverse climatic conditions causing food deficits, loss of livelihoods and population displacement: over 3 million people in the region are officially displaced as a result of conflict 
    Gender inequity: this remains a major hindrance to rural development. Constraints on women include excessive workload as a result of poor infrastructure, scarce resources and migration of men and poor access to health services

Like much of sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania has experienced a surge in land-based investment during the past decade. While expanding private investment in agriculture is a core ambition of the G8’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, experiences of prior investments raise questions about possible negative impacts. A notable element of this pattern of international private investment in Tanzania has been the emergence of biofuels as a form of agriculture; biofuel investments occurred rapidly and on a large scale around 2005–2008, with about four million hectares around the country requested for allocation to commercial biofuel projects. Many of those investments were large-scale projects based on the cultivation of jatropha or sugarcane, headed by European companies. One of the most well-known biofuel investments was that of Bioshape, which acquired approximately 34,000 ha in Kilwa District for the cultivation of jatropha.
The report documents, insofar as is possible using available information, the process Bioshape and government authorities at national and district level undertook to acquire the land from the four villages in Kilwa where Bioshape established operations.

eldis:A67466;Payments for ecosystem services schemes: project-level insights on benefits for ecosystems and the rural poor.;;"Payments  for  ecosystem  services (PES)  provide a market based instrument to motivate changes in land use that degrade ecosystem services. This investigation sought  to better understand how effective PES schemes are in meeting the goals of safeguarding ecosystem services,  while  also  benefitting  local  livelihoods and ensuring pro-poor outcomes.Based on an internet survey of 36 PES projects, including water-bio-diversity and carbon- leading  attributes, and analysis of a sub-set of nine case studies, we explore a range of insights and commonalities between projects.

Findings indicate that in most cases non-financial benefits in the short-term lead to longer term financial  benefits for  landholders, most often as yield  increases, future  harvest  revenue and  access to markets  for  products. Many projects are not quantifying the full range of Ecosystem Service (ES) benefits they are providing however, full compensation for these benefits is not necessary to safeguard the environmental  services. Market mechanisms are an imperfect means of pricing the value of ecosystem services, particularly when enabling policies do not exist or are not consistent (e.g.  policies committing to greenhouse gas emission reductions). While national level  PES  schemes (e.g.  REDD+) share many similarities with project scale PES schemes, they fundamentally differ in their ability to deploy a  full  suite  of  incentives,  policies, and  regulatory interventions  in  order  to  meet  their  domestic  programme  goals,  thus  addressing  equity  and  efficiency needs.

Policies that implicitly subsidize a wasteful and environmentally destructive use of resources are pervasive: reforms should command a high priority on economic as well as environmental grounds.  Compared to regulation, market-based instruments are little used but they can be more efficient; they can also produce revenues to finance environmental improvements. Regulatory effectiveness can be improved by: relying more on preventive measures, including environmental impact assessment; targeting large polluters; strengthening enforcement; and favouring mediation over litigation.

eldis:A25885;Biotechnology and sustainable crop production in Zimbabwe;;This case study of Zimbabwe has examined developments in biotechnology against the background of a well-developed national agricultural research, plant breeding and seeds system. It has then assessed the constraints to biotechnology research, technology development and diffusion in the light of the resources available and the technology transfer mechanisms in place for different groups of farmers. The study concludes that, in the case of Zimbabwe's large-scale commercial farmers, the transfer of biotechnology applications will be determined essentially by their economic advantage over techniques currently in use. In the case of the small-scale and communal areas farmers, it is unlikely that biotechnology innovations - particularly when delivered as seed - would be adopted unless special policy measures to address the problems of seeds supply, are taken. ;John J.

eldis:A25884;Structural adjustment and Moroccan agriculture: an assessment of the reforms in the sugar and cereal sectors;;"This paper reviews the process of agricultural policy reforms in Morocco in the 1980's, with particular emphasis on the cereals and sugar sub-sectors. Agricultural policy is reviewed in historical perspective, to show that the liberalisation process which was proposed in the framework of structural adjustment reforms ran contrary to the agricultural development strategy followed by Morocco since Independence. The macro-economic performance of Morocco is examined. It shows that the origin of the economic policy reforms can be found in the necessity to seek balance of payment ssupport. This led from a series of orthodox stabilisation measures to a process of liberalisation and structural adjustment which has affected a certain number of sectors including agriculture. The history of proposals for agricultural reforms is outlined and the extent of actual implementation is discussed. The adequacy of policy instruments and the impact of reforms are reviewed in a more detailed form for the cereals and sugar sub-sectors. The effects of the reform process on poverty are discussed, and the content of compensatory programmes is considered. Conclusions cover: the political economy of reforms; efficiency and distribution and poverty effects; World Bank's contribution to reforms; various technical issues concerning the appropriateness of policy instruments.

eldis:A70207;Women’s Land Rights in Pakistan: Policy Brief 22;;"Women’s land ownership and control have important connections with their empowerment in Pakistan’s agricultural context. However, the link between these has largely remained unexplored; and there has been only a few research to determine how many women own or control land in Pakistan. The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) carried out a multiple pronged research in 2007-09 to fill this knowledge gap and to examine the reason behind women’s land ownership and empowerment. The research focused on women’s rights vis-à-vis the inheritance of private agrarian land and did not include private residential or commercial property and other possible means of land acquisition by women like through purchase or as gifts.

This paper which is a report on the findings of the above research indicates that women’s ownership and control of land have positive linkages with sustainable development, reduction of poverty, food security and environmental concerns. the question of land rights is often assumed to be related to an undifferentiated homogenous category of landless poor peasants, ignoring the power relations and hierarchies within the poor andwomen’s empowerment is mostly perceived to be limited to welfare in terms of theirimproved access to education, health and non-farm assets; and their economic status is only measured in terms of employment.

in conclusion, some of the recommendations incuse comprehensive land reforms, revisiting Islam and women’s land rights, encouraging the right to forego rights, provision of land to the landless, provision of training and other support to women with land, inclusion of agricultural labour in the formal economy, provision of extension services to women, preserve and build upon existing traditional agricultural knowledge, engagement of local councillors, provision of Social Protection systems and strengthening state service delivery institutions and urgent need to update birth and marriage registration and land record.

eldis:A23465;The Movement of the Landless (MST) and the juridical field in Brazil;;This working paper focuses on the Movement of the Landless (MST) and the various legal strategies used to redefine property law in Brazil. Through a number of legal strategies MST has helped produce watershed high court rulings, contributed to the process of constitutionalising law, and made access to land more equitable in parts of Brazil by redefining property rights in practice.The paper explores legal change triggered by the strategic action through what Bourdieu calls the juridical field (relating to the function and administration of the judicial system). The author argues that MST has been successful in pushing forward legal change through this field for two broad reasons:the MST’s ability to concentrate the talents of diverse juridical actors on defending its claims has made it an important catalyst for legal change through the juridical field. The movement’s ability to mobilise highly skilled legal talent has been built by mobilising across multiple fields, not just the juridicalthe MST in the 1990s had new opportunities to set juridical modalities of change in motion because of a number of favourable changes in both the movement and juridical fields. These changes were related to the transition to democracy and the rising prominence of the Workers’ Party, and to changes within the transnational religious field in which the diverse institutions of the Catholic Church hold a dominant positionThe analysis finds that the MST’s sustained engagement with the juridical field has set a number of modalities of legal change in motion that redefined important legal terrain on property rights and civil disobedience. It also produced substantial social results. The movement’s ability to convert movement energy into juridical energy, and to mobilise across multiple fields, has played a central role in setting these modalities of legal change in motion.The MST’s juridical mobilisation sheds light on some of the ways in which social movements can use the law to create countervailing possibilities to the particular “liberal” property regime that is being globalised from above. It has played a substantial role in altering a highly exclusionary legality by compelling public authorities to implement existing agrarian reform legislation and by helping to create and institutionalise novel interpretations of the social function of property. ;P.

eldis:A73223;Demonstrating 'respect' for the UNFCCC REDD+ safeguards: the importance of community-collected information;;"This paper argues that stakeholder groups – specifically indigenous and local communities living in or directly dependent upon forests – can often offer an important source of knowledge and capacity.

It highlights that these people can support data gathering for safeguard information needs, especially in places where existing monitoring systems cannot do so comprehensively. The paper argues that their involvement is important for protecting their rights, and critical for minimising the risk that REDD+, or the safeguards, could fail to meet their objectives.

It is argued that community information on a small number of indicators, consolidated at a national scale, can be useful for assessing the effectiveness of all of the safeguards. Information gathering by adequately trained communities can be as cost effective and accurate as professional information gathering, allowing decision-makers under budget and capacity constraints to build confidently on existing community-based information systems.

eldis:A23744;Eye on EITI: civil society perspectives and recommendations on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;;"Launched in September 2002, EITI brings together representatives from governments, oil, gas, and mining companies, and civil society to address the paradox that has come to be known as the ""resource curse"" in which two-thirds of the world’s poorest people inhabit countries rich in natural resources. This report presents their insights into the realities of EITI implementation in specific countries and presents recommendations on what is needed to ensure success.In the four years since its launch, EITI has recorded some notable achievements. Twenty-one governments of resource-rich countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Central Asia have endorsed the initiative and the International Advisory Group (IAG) has developed many of the necessary guidelines, criteria, and governance structures. However, as this report demonstrates, there is great room for improvement. Of the 21 endorsing countries: two have published fully audited and reconciled EITI reportseight have yet to take even the initial step of appointing an individual to lead the EITI processten have not yet formed the required multi-stakeholder committeeeleven do not have a drafted and approved work plan.In order that further progress is made in improving financial transparency in the extractive industries and ensuring this translates into improved accountability and use of revenues, the report offers a number of recommendations. They include:Protect the credibility of EITI by ensuring that rhetorical commitments are matched by concrete actions within meaningful timeframesin each country, appoint a leader with the time, bureaucratic skill, and political influence to drive EITI implementationrecognise that genuine civil society participation is a requirement of EITI and support its active engagement in each critical step of the EITI processensure that no civil society campaigner is harassed or intimidated for their work to promote transparencyensure that civil society representatives are genuinely from that sector and not from those representing the interests of others such as political parties or companiesincrease financial and technical support to build civil society’s capacity to participate in EITI.[adapted from author] ";;;Publish What You Pay;eldis;01/01/2006;en;extractive industries;;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A23744;http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/english/pdf/pubs/eyeoneiti.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publishwhatyoupay.org%2Fenglish%2Fpdf%2Fpubs%2Feyeoneiti.pdf;;;;"Accountability Government;Private sector corruption;Corporate Social Responsibility;extractive industries;Good governance corruption;Political corruption;Good Governance;Accountability private sector;Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;mining revenues;gas revenues;Business and corruption;Extractive industries;transparency;Good governance accountability;oil revenues;Resource curse;Governance;EITI"
eldis:A26212;Water Resource Development in the Drought-prone Uplands;;Improved agriculture in the Drought Prone Uplands (DPUs) depends critically on better water conservation and management. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding issues of water availability, allocation and local rights. Despite broad similarities in the goals of many programmes, there has been a lack of consistency and coherence among them. The focus of this paper is on the difficulties of developing a coherent analytical framework that would enable questions of technical and institutional choice to be addressed systematically. It is aimed primarily at development agencies interested in strengthening the effectiveness of programmes in DPU areas. Issues relating to the scaling up of appropriate approaches and technologies and the search for an effective research and development approach are also addressed. ;"C. Turton

eldis:A32440;Advancing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;;"This report examines the benefits that a resource-rich country can derive from endorsing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and implementing its Principles. It also searches for courses of action that the EITI Board can pursue to persuade more countries to endorse EITI. Both issues are investigated in the context of Angola, Indonesia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The authors argue that EITI is particularly beneficial for countries that suffer from the so-called “resource curse”. In these countries the natural resource wealth paradoxically does not lead to growth and reduction of poverty. The reasons for this are poor governance and corruption, inappropriate expansion of public spending, excessive borrowing and the collapse of other sectors. Three principle recommendations are made to the EITI Board: 

    prioritise among countries. Focus on those countries that offer the potential to generate tangible results within the next three years. 
     position EITI as “good cop” and outsource the “bad cop” to civil society and media. Frame EITI as an institution that offers assistance and helps countries to placate critics. Create momentum for EITI by exercising pressure. 
     formalise EITI’s positive impact on sovereign risk ratings and offer improved access to private capital as an incentive for the implementation of EITI principles.

eldis:A38542;Urban environments, wealth and health: shifting burdens and possible responses in low and middle-income nations;;"This paper examines urban health in low- and middle-income countries, in relation to two sets of environmental issues: 

    persistent local environmental health burdens, and most notably the water, sanitation and housing deficiencies prevalent in the poor neighbourhoods of so many urban settlements 
    emerging global environmental burdens that will be experienced in urban areas, and most notably those associated with climate change 

The paper situates these issues within a policy-relevant framework that can help to reveal the sorts of strategies best able to address them. The paper has four sections: 

    the first section considers how a health perspective can provide an alternative or complement to the dominant economic perspective on urban well-being. This is relevant to both local and global environmental issues, and to urban planning more generally. 
    the second section turns to some of the transitions commonly associated with “development”, including not only the economic and urban transitions, but also the demographic, health and environmental transitions. These transitions are presented as politically and socially contingent, and not as laws of development 
    the third section examines in more detail the environmental health risks associated with deficient water, sanitation and housing 
    the final section focuses on climate change 

While the challenges of urban housing, water and sanitation are clearly very different from those of cities and climate change, there are also important similarities particularly when it comes to health vulnerabilities and the need for action. The urban groups most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change are likely to be within the deprived urban populations that currently suffer from environmental health risks due to inadequate housing, water and sanitation. This reflects a broader generality: the urban populations most vulnerable to global environmental pressures are those already facing the greatest health risks as the result of local environmental burdens. Alternatively, even in low- and middle-income countries, settlements that have managed to address their local environmental challenges efficiently and equitably are likely to be in a better position to adapt to the challenges of global environmental change. Thus, urban settlements that have already addressed the water and sanitation challenges of their most vulnerable populations are likely to be in the best position to cope with increasing water scarcity. Similarly, urban settlements that have already addressed the land and housing challenges of their most vulnerable populations are likely to be in the best position to cope with increasing flood risks.

eldis:A21998;Tree and land tenure: rapid appraisal tools;;"Manual offers guidelines for using rapid appraisal methods to gather information on tenure and natural resource management. It translates the concepts elaborated in Community Forestry Note 5, rapid appraisal of tree and land tenure. The author defines rapid appraisal as ""a family of methodologies designed to encourage the  participation of local communities in the collection and use of information to improve their livelihood. The methods which have been used in all parts of the world, put a premium on the usefulness of research as well as the rapidity with which results are obtained."" The method developed divides resources into three broad categories - holdings, commons and reserves - and helps to structure information gathered to gain an understanding how villages and households approach tree and forest resource management in each category. To be effective, this method must not only provide  information quickly but also ensure that it is used. That is, agencies must be prepared to adapt their programs and activities in response to what they have learned about local        realities. Chapter 1 of this manual gives a brief introduction to tenure and rapid appraisal. Preparations needed to carry out a tenure study are discussed in Chapter 2.  Chapter 3 suggests practical techniques that have proved useful in gathering information  in the field. Chapter 4 presents methods that may be helpful in organizing and analyzing the information collected as well as writing the report. The final chapter discusses issues that may come up in using the information that has been gathered and notes some of the common problems that may arise.[author] ";K.

eldis:A69620;Land management and democratic governance in the city of Johannesburg;;"Land Management embraces systems of land administration, land use management, land information management, and land taxation. Land management is generally understood in South Africa as the manner in which land is controlled, managed, planned for, utilised and transacted. This study saw land management as having a number of dimensions including: the manner in which land is accessed and acquired; the process by which individuals, households and communities continue to have and to hold rights to land; the way in which land use is regulated; the systems by which land is developed; and how land is traded.

This study was born out of deep sense of concern regarding current land management practices, systems and protocols in South Africa. It tried to address the question of ‘what might a land management system look like that takes seriously questions of inclusive citizenship, rights to land, and social vulnerability?’. Five Johannesburg case studies were investigated: Diepkloof, Soweto; Kliptown, Soweto; Diepsloot, northern Johannesburg; Fourways, north-western Johannesburg and Hillbrow/Berea in the City’s centre. The five case study areas were chosen in an attempt to get a sense of the various settlement typologies in Johannesburg, in which different systems – social, cultural, formal and informal – are at work.

In a context such as Johannesburg there are diverse systems of land management ranging from highly formal and legally regulated to entirely informal systems. They also include various hybrids, which bring together the formal, informal, and even within this very urban context, the customary. Land management is also integrally related to broader concerns of participatory and developmental governance. The case studies focused on these dimensions and attempted to draw out the manner in which these formal, informal, and hybridised systems were being utilised by the communities and households in these areas. Many of the researchers emphasised tenure and tenure-related issues, which influence how land and property is held and protected. In part this relates to the interwoven nature of housing and land in South Africa, which are difficult to separate and often conflated. Land is often equated with residential development and ignored for commercial, industrial, ecological, transport and recreational purposes”.

The findings of the study pointed a number of different things; the first is the inappropriateness of the regulations governing the areas in question when contrasted against the people living and operating in these areas. The system attempts to maintain a unified and coherent modernist planning paradigm over areas that do not necessarily benefit from such an approach. There is clearly a severe disjuncture between what the people are doing in these areas out of senses of necessity and the kind of regulation that is in place, which appears at the level of rhetoric to be supportive to the needs of the poor but is in reality at best neutral but in most cases is actively obstructive. The raiding and occasional harassment of hawkers and beggars in Fourways, the lack of acknowledgement of the importance of urban farming are all indicative of a system that is not able to address the competing needs and goals of poor households and the organizing principles of government.

eldis:A27790;Krismon, farmers and forests: the effects of the economic crisis on farmers’ livelihoods and forest use in the outer islands of Indonesia;;Presents some preliminary results on the impact of the economic crisis on farmers’ livelihood and forest use, based on fieldwork in four provinces in Indonesia (Riau, West and East Kalimantan, Central Sulawesi). Stresses the great variation throughout the country, and the volatility of the situation. Price data reveal that some groups of export crops-oriented farmers enjoyed a short-term gain during the first 2-3 quarters of 1998. Soaring food prices and a stronger rupiah since October 1998 have, however, gradually made real prices move towards their pre-crisis levels. Indeed, authors found that the crisis has had a larger negative impact on farmers than initially hypothesised, whereas the short-term impact on forest might have been smaller than some feared. Most poor farmers lack the means to take advantage of higher crop prices. Better-off farmers, immigrants and urban dwellers with capital are more likely to utilise the opportunities created by the crisis and convert forests to high profitability crops. Found limited evidence in the survey area of return migration from the cities. An underestimated effect of the present situation might be the lack of law enforcement and a power vacuum, which have made illegal logging and encroachment of protected areas more likely.

eldis:A11667;Whose business?: a handbook on corporate responsibility for human rights and the environment;;This handbook aims to provide an introduction to the key issues driving efforts to promote corporate social responsibility and accountability worldwide. It focuses especially on the links between the environment, labor rights, and human rights in the context of globalisation.The central theme of this handbook is that the institutions and regulatory frameworks now governing the global economy have not adequately protected human rights, the environment, and labor rights. Free markets are not really free: they merely privatize the benefits of globalisation, while socialising the human and environmental costs. Moving to a new paradigm of socially responsible business will require a creative and synergistic combination of popular pressure, corporate initiative, and global regulation. The handbook describes actions being taken at all three levels.Three case studies of oil company operations spanning Nigeria, Ecuador and the Caspian, and four case studies of high tech company operations spanning India, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan are incorporated along with studies from other industries.The handbook includes the following chapters:chapter one examines the global context in which multinational corporations operatechapter two outlines the connections among the environmental, labor, and human rights issues that plague MNC operations in developing countrieschapter three focuses on the emerging movement to increase the social responsibility and accountability of MNCs. It looks at the tactics and strategies employed by external sources—activists, nonprofit advocates—as well as those used by internal stakeholders—workers, investors, shareholders, and corporate managers themselves. This chapter also discusses how corporations have responded by adopting codes of conduct and exploring other ways to go beyond compliance with existing regulationschapter four examines efforts to set new global rules and guidelines for MNCs. Drawing from existing and emerging international law and agreements, these rules encompass fundamental principles of human rights, labor rights, and environmental protection. This chapter also covers right-to-know laws, which require corporations to disclose information about overseas social and environmental performanceThe handbook concludes by suggesting that businesses and civil society groups must refine and redouble their efforts to change, and that any effort to create global standards must be a collaboration among all stakeholders. Public education at all levels—high school, university, adult school, and popular education—is at the center of winning hearts and minds. Young people have an especially important role to play. ;"S.

eldis:A12413;Zimbabwe: fast track land reform in Zimbabwe;;This report considers the human rights implications of the 'fast track' process of land redistribution in Zimbabwe, under which the government has revised the constitution and amended legislation in order to allow it to acquire commercial farms compulsorily and without compensation, and the land occupations that have accompanied it since early 2000. It focusses on the violence that has accompanied the land occupations since this time, on the discrimination on political grounds that has accompanied the allocation of new plots, and on adverse effects that the fast track land reform process has had for one of the constituencies which was supposed to benefit the rural poor. ;;;Human Rights Watch ;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"land;land reform;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"202;ZWE";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12413;http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/zimbabwe/ZimLand0302.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrw.org%2Freports%2F2002%2Fzimbabwe%2FZimLand0302.pdf;;;;"Human rights;Conflict and security;democracy in Africa;elections;Agriculture and food;Land tenure;land reform"
eldis:A41113;Urbanisation, global environmental change, and sustainable development in Latin America;;"Despite the central role of urban areas in socio-economic and geo-political change processes at the local, regional, and global level, as well as in the regional and global biophysical processes, little attention has been paid so far to the complex and dynamic interactions between urban areas and the biophysical and chemical processes of global environmental changes.This book contributes to the knowledge about these interactions. It is a collection of the work by a group of Latin American researchers of various disciplines, focused on studying the interactions between global and regional environmental changes and urban areas. These interactions can be grouped into two broad areas: 

    those associated with climate change and variability
    those associated with changes in land use and land cover

The first three chapters of the book focus on the various aspects of the interactions between climate and urban areas. The next three present case studies of changes in land use and land cover. The last chapter introduces a series of reflections that may guide future areas of research on the topic and improve the relation between scientific research and the management practices of urban areas in Latin America.The discussion in the book reveals how important it is that the urbanisation process in Latin America be directed toward a more balanced growth and better living conditions for millions of urban inhabitants. It also recognises and analyzes the opportunities afforded by sustainable development during this growth, while stressing the need to base this concept on multidimensional, integrated, and operational perspectives to enable better management of the complex reality of urban systems in Latin America.The authors also emphasise that attention to urban problems in the region shouldprovide balanced consideration of small, medium, and large urban centres since they have problems similar to those in mega cities, but they have fewer available resources to tend to their problems.

eldis:A11908;Land policy for pro-poor development: draft;;"This draft paper outlines a strategy for World Bank involvement in land policies. It focuses on property rights to land, land transactions, and socially optimal use of land. The report recommends three principles which land policy should aim to promote:it should help to realize the potential of the private sector who will have to be the main engine of growth and who will greatly benefit from clarity in the assignment of property rights and low transaction costs and all the benefits associated with thisgiven that land policy has in the past often severely discriminated against the poor, specific actions to
empower this group are justified to provide them with equal access to economic opportunitiesan appropriate land policy implies a very important role for government to provide the basis for functioning of markets, to regulate such markets, and to provide public goods.On property rights to land, key conclusions include:Socially accepted and low-cost mechanisms of managing and resolving conflict so as to reduce its socially disruptive and investment-reducing impact, and to prevent it from escalating into large-scale (ethnic) confrontation, are likely to become of increasing importance, especially in Africa. effective protection of property rights can have a considerable positive impact on equity as well as efficiencyhigher levels of tenure security will greatly increase the incentives for land-related investment and will induce better land management.the fundamental role for government is to provide with tenure security to land through both legal measures and the effective implementation of these in institutions. While individualization of land rights is a more efficient arrangement in many circumstances,  there are many cases (e.g. for indigenous groups, herders, and marginal agriculturalists) where definition of property rights at the level of the group, together with a process for adjusting the property rights system to changed circumstances where needed, can help to significantly reduce the danger of encroachment by outsiders while ensuring sufficient security to individuals. As long as groups can internally decide on individuals’ resource access and other issues following basic conditions of representativeness and transparency, securing group rights can contribute to better and more sustainable land management as well as more equitable access to productive resources.On land transactions,  land sales and land rental markets are found to have different advantages and shortcomings. Key conclusions include:Land rentals can provide access to land in a low-cost fashion as a response to exogenous shocks, off-farm employment, changing
 opportunities and interests, or even in situations where the final ownership status of land is still being clarified. In most situations, rental markets (including share cropping  arrangements) improve the allocation of land and enhance equity. Where property rights are not secure, land owners will not be willing to rent out under longer-term contracts. The impact of rental markets on equity will depend on the way in which the surplus is shared between landlord and tenants, something that is dependent on the alternative opportunities open to the latter. Even though the transaction costs associated with land rentals are normally lower than those in sales markets, there are opportunities to reduce them by making information on land ownership, contractual forms, and prices more widely available.Land sales markets are normally associated with much higher transaction costs than are land rental markets. Acquiring land through purchase requires a considerable outlay of cash which may be out of reach for households who do not have access to non-agricultural income. In situations where markets for credit and insurance are imperfect, the supply of land in the sale market may be mainly through distress sales. Distortions which favor larger farmers, as well as the tendency of land prices to exceed the capitalized value of agricultural incomes from land imply that, even in situations where there is a strong productive advantage of small farmers, the contribution of land sales markets to bringing about a farm size distribution that is more efficient and more equitable may be limited.Government imposed restrictions on land market transactions have not yielded the expected outcomes because they were difficult to enforce, and in fact the restrictions resulted in efficiency losses. The conclusions from this are that:there is very little merit to land rental restrictions and the only relevant policy question is how to sequence their elimination in a way that minimizes disruptions and negative equity impactsin most settings it will be unrealistic to assume that restrictions on the functioning of markets will lead to significant re-distribution of land and other productive assets to the poor. Other mechanisms will be required to accomplish this with the possible exception of very loosely defined restrictions on maximum farm sizes, universal limitations on sales markets are unlikely to be effective but may lead to the emergence of large bureaucracies that develop a self-interest in the maintenance of these restrictionscohesive communities may impose restrictions on
 transferability of land to outsiders at certain stages of their development out of a concern for social harmony and the prevention of landlessness. Policy should ensure that the mechanisms for reaching such a transition are transparent and representative, and that changes in such rules are feasible where they do no longer serve the interest of the majority of community members.Recommendations on how to contribute to socially optimal use of land include: land reform policies need to be embedded in a broader strategy for recipients’ productive development, which decentralizes as much responsibility as possible, and which (while transferring wealth to the poor), adheres to basic principles of constitutionality and fairness.regulation to avoid socially and environmentally harmful outcomes and to ensure that externalities are internalized, is justified. This includes mechanisms to ensure the protection of fragile environments which, through various channels (biodiversity, hydrological flows, carbon sinks), provide local or global public goods.Government regulation is also critical in peri-urban areas, in two respects. On the one hand, there need to be provisions to avoid externalities and provide public goods, including green-spaces and the preservation of unique historical and cultural values. On the other hand it is important to have mechanisms in place to facilitate that land for urban expansion and the associated services will be available in a cost-effective way and therefore be accessible to the poor.[adapted from author] ";;;World Bank;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"development;land;contract farming;property rights;land tenure;land rights;poverty;rural development;land markets;land reform;transaction costs";Land & Investments;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A11908;;;;;;"contract farming;property rights;Animal production and health;pastoralism land rights and tenure;Poverty;institutional reform;land tenure;Agriculture and food;Governance;land rights;land markets;conflict;rural development;Poverty focused aid;Land tenure;Pastoralism resource management;land reform;Aid and debt;Pastoralism;urban development;transaction costs"
eldis:A70263;The case for land and agrarian reforms in Pakistan ;;"In Pakistan, the case for both land reform and, more broadly, agrarian reforms, is premised on the need to create sustainable livelihoods which is widely agreed to be the most effective method of alleviating poverty. In addition, land reform combats social injustice while achieving sustained economic growth.

Land ownership in Pakistan is highly concentrated, and, in the NWFP province for which data from the Federal Land Commission is available, this is even more evident between 1980 and 1990. This paper examines this case of land reforms in Pakistan stating that land reforms that are based on specifying a ceiling on individual land holding creates the opportunity to distribute land to landless labor and tenant farmers. However, without the strong support network of agrarian reforms, the redistribution of land per se may not create sustainable livelihoods.

The paper notes that agrarian reforms are also called for because, over the last 56 years, the trend has been and remains that of a rapid increase in the number of small farm as a proportion of total farms. As land becomes more fragmented, large landlords, who have the requisite liquidity, can add to their holdings. Thus the goal for the state is both to ensure a fair distribution of land holdings and also ensure broader agrarian reforms that ensures that small farm cultivation is both just, if under tenancy contact, and sustainable if under self-cultivation

The paper concludes by suggesting the abolition of exemptions such as for orchards, stud farms, farm machinery and gifts; land ownership ceilings should apply to households rather than to individuals; only cultivable and not wasteland should be resumed and this should be done in a timely manner; strong legal framework that support quick dispensation of appeals and to ensure the reforms are not reversed, extension and credit support will be necessary.

eldis:A45138;A disharmonious trade: China and the continued destruction of Burma’s northern frontier forests;;"The report documents on illegal logging and illegal export of timber to China in Kachin State in Burma, which is on the border of China and where deforestation is at its worst. It also documents the response of the relevant authorities in both Burma and China to ‘A Choice for China’, a Global Witnessexposure of the massive illegal timber trade between Burma and China in 2005 which resulted in a ban on logging and timber transportation in Kachin State in Burma and a Chinese ban on the importation of Burmese timber followed by Interim Measures to control the trade.Key findings are:

    there is a decline in the Illegal timber trade on the Burma-China border
    international trade in timber illegally logged in Kachin Stateis ongoing
    there is a decline in illegal logging in Kachin State since the launch of Global Witness’ report ‘A Choice for China’ in October 2005
    half of China’s timber imports from all countries are probably illegal.

The paper gives three key recommendations broken down and targeting the different parties involved.The recommendations given are:

    end illegal logging in Kachin state and associated Burma- China timber trade
    combat illegal logging and associated trade in Asia and beyond
    disassociate from human rights abuses in Burma

To the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC):

    make all relevant authorities and businesses in China aware of the 11 May 2006 ‘Interim Measures to Manage Timber and Mineral Cooperation between Myanmar and Yunnan Province’
    establish permanent measures to manage the Burma- China cross-border timber trade
    monitor the environmental and social impacts of Chinese logging companies and Chinese companies clearing forested land for the production of cash crops operating in Burma
    ensure that Chinese companies in Burma are made familiar with, and operate in accordance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and State Forest Administration guidelines for Chinese enterprises engaged in ‘sustainable forest cultivation’ overseas
    ensure that the draft guidelines for Chinese enterprises engaged in logging overseas are finalized and issued, following the stakeholder consultations that took place in 2008
    encourage “ASEAN Plus Three” to include environmental crimes, in particular the trade in illicit timber, as a priority area for discussion/cooperation
    To the State Peace and Development Council
    continue efforts to stop illegal and unsustainable logging in Kachin State and end the illegal crossborder timber trade with China
    ensure that foreigners and foreign companies are not involved in timber harvesting in Kachin State
    ensure that natural resources in Kachin State, including forests, are managed in an equitable, participatory, sustainable, and transparent manner
    prepare and implement a national strategy to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD)
    contribute fully to Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) in ASEAN and encourage the participation of the Myanmar Ministry of Forestry, relevant officials within the armed ethnic opposition groups’ administrations, and civil society in FLEG.

To the armed ethnic opposition groups in Kachin State:

    notify the relevant authorities in both Burma and China of all illegal timber transportation when it passes through areas under their control and prior to its export to China
    suspend logging activities, development projects and commercial operations that are unsustainable or are of questionable economic and social value.

To the International Community:

    establish a working group with representatives from the SPDC, armed ethnic opposition groups, civil society, United Nations agencies and the Chinese authorities to facilitate measures to combat continued illegal and unsustainable logging in northern Burma and support initiatives to promote sustainable development in Kachin State
    implement a timber procurement policy, which requires central and regional government authorities to purchase only timber and wood-derived products originating from legal and sustainable sources.

eldis:A42268;From conflict to peacebuilding: the role of natural resources and the environment;;"Conflicts associated with natural resources are twice as likely to relapse into conflict in the first five years, an imminent report suggests. Indeed the natural resource curse has been a primary determinant of intra-state conflict in terrible theatres of war such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia. Yet it extends far beyond the battle to acquire precious commodities. With climate change and population growth placing ever-increasing demands on the environment, it is widely recognised that conflict over basic resources, such as water and arable land, will increase – see Darfur and the Middle East. This new report from the UN calls for environment and natural resource issues to be integrated into peacebuilding, decrying that less than a quarter of peace negotiations aiming to resolve conflicts linked to natural resources have addressed resource management mechanisms. The authors draw three main conclusions from their research: 

    natural resources and the environment can be implicated in all phases of the conflict cycle, contributing to the outbreak and perpetuation of violence and undermining prospects for peace
    the environment can itself fall victim to conflict, as direct and indirect environmental damage, coupled with the collapse of institutions, can lead to environmental risks that threaten health, livelihoods and security
    natural resources and the environment can contribute to peacebuilding through economic development, employment generation and sustainable livelihoods 

And offer a number of recommendations, including: 

    further develop UN capacities for early warning and early action - include environmental and natural resource issues in international and regional conflict early warning systems and develop expertise for preventive action
    improve oversight and protection of natural resources during conflicts - develop international certification mechanisms to ensure that natural resources can be tracked more effectively
    address natural resources and the environment as part of the peacemaking and peacekeeping process - ensure that there are processes in place within peace agreements for the transparent, equitable and legitimate definition and realisation of property rights and resource revenues and tenure
    integrate natural resource and environmental issues into post-conflict planning - systematically conduct post-conflict environmental assessments that identify environmental risks to human health, livelihoods and security and prioritize needs in the short and medium term.

The event agreed there was a pressing need for greater regional consolidation of knowledge on improving water management for smallholder farmers. The meeting allowed participants the opportunity to explore how an emerging concept developed under GWI EA of Water-Smart Agriculture (WaSA) could support future policy attention to and investment in this critical area.  This collection of articles develops further the WaSA approach in East Africa, providing a starting point for thinking and inspiring future efforts.

In order to redress centuries of dispossession, this highly complex process has the potential to encourage economic growth and poverty reduction. Based on a 2004 conference in Cape Town, this publication details the major themes in the de-racialisation of land ownership in South Africa.The book covers the work of ten key voices on the issue of land reform both regionally and in South Africa. The first section of the book establishes a historical, theoretical and comparative context for the South African debate. In the second section, contributors present their perspectives on how the land question should be framed in South Africa, analyse existing land policy and its results, and propose alternatives and future directions for policy and practice.This collection represents reflections on the land situation during a decade of democracy which, with the added benefit of hindsight, can can contribute to a more robust and focused policy debate. ;"L.

eldis:A76305;The cost of irrigation water in the Jordan Valley;;"The purpose of this study was to determine the financial cost of irrigation water in the Jordan Valley and the corresponding impact of higher water prices on farming. The analysis shows that JVA needs significant tariff increases to be able to attain a more financially sustainable footing. In case JVA wants to at least cover its operating and maintenance costs in 2013, it will require JD 0.108 per m3 - assuming that the current cross-subsidies and current inefficiency levels remain unchanged. Yet, if the JVA would be able to reduce its billing and collection inefficiencies, the required irrigation water tariff drops to JD 0.066 per m3.

The more efficient JVA becomes in providing irrigation water, the smaller the required tariff increases. The JVA can improve its efficiency by (i) changing billing and collection practices; (ii) change in the revenue policies; and (iii) efficiency gains in the delivery of JVA services.

The impact of tariff increases on farmers’ incomes is in general very moderate because water costs make up only a small part of the total cost of farming. Certain cropping patterns will be much more affected by the tariff increases than others. It is especially crops that tend to consume large volumes of water (citrus), that will feel the impact of the irrigation water tariffs. Because the agricultural sector in Jordan is under stress, any government policy to rationalize irrigation water subsidies should where possible try to increase the resilience of farmers.

The farmer survey found that 17 percent of the survey respondents could be classified as poor for which specific measures may be needed to help them cope with the effect of higher water prices.

eldis:A76268;Climate change vulnerability in fisheries and aquaculture: A synthesis of six regional studies;;"Global reviews of the impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture systems carried out in 2009 revealed a paucity and patchiness of information concerning climate impacts on the sector. Six follow-up regional case studies were then launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in an attempt to start filling the gaps and to provide direction and initial steps in adaptation planning. Fisheries and aquaculture systems were selected across the globe to allow for diversity.

The approach of the case studies followed a template allowing them to: (i) define vulnerability to climate change by understanding potential impacts on the system, the sensitivity of the system to such changes and the current adaptive capacity;

(ii) identify gaps in existing knowledge in assessing the vulnerability of the system;

(iii) identify potential strategies for reducing vulnerability to climate change; and

(iv) provide policy guidance in reducing system vulnerability.

The objective of this publication is to consolidate, further interpret, refine and draw conclusions from the information gathered on climate change impacts, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of fish production systems in the diverse and geographically distinct social-ecological systems covered by the six case studies.

Although the specificity of each case study and the complexity of vulnerability prevent a generalization of issues and the drawing of broad conclusions, the present document captures common threads from a close examination of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the systems considered. Information on these three characteristics of vulnerability is particularly relevant to policymakers, development practitioners and members of the academic community concerned with the impacts of climate change on aquatic resources and the communities and economies they support.

It can be used to identify areas in which interventions, policy development and/or further research are needed to better equip these systems and their stakeholders to reduce their vulnerability and enhance their adaptation to long-term climate-induced changes. It can also be used as a benchmark against which improvements in capacity may be measured or monitored over time.

eldis:A64947;Water security & the global water agenda: a UN-Water analytical brief;;This analytical brief serves as a starting point for dialogue on water security in the United Nations system. Through this brief, UN-Water aims to capture the constantly evolving dimensions of water-related issues, offering a holistic outlook on challenges under the umbrella of water security. It highlights the main challenges to be addressed, the role water security plays in policy agendas and possible options for addressing water security challenges. The paper stresses that water security needs to be included in the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG process must incorporate a goal and related targets for achieving water security, as this will address multiple priority development areas under consideration. The paper also argues that investment in water security is a long-term pay-off for human development and economic growth, with immediate visible short-term gains. ;;;UN-Water;eldis;01/01/2013;en;"climate change;research";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A64947;http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/watersecurity_analyticalbrief.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in%2Ffiles%2Ffile%2Fwatersecurity_analyticalbrief.pdf;;;;"Global Governance;SDGs;Climate change;International climate change negotiations;Water in climate change;CDKN;research;Governance;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;tfmimport;Funder"
eldis:A14501;What drives tropical deforestation?: a meta-analysis of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation based on subnational case study evidence;;Using the framework of the Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) Science/Research Plan this study takes 152 studies of deforestation in different regions of varying size from around the tropics and analyses them to assess how important different causes of deforestation really are. It claims to be the first which quantifies the impact of cultural or socio-political driving forces upon deforestation.The study gives a brief rationale why subnational – and not country-wide – case study evidence constitutes an important tool  in LUCC and outlines the analytical concept of proximate and underlying causes of land change used in LUCC research.  The authors then attempt to generalize results across regions or broad geographical entities (Africa, Asia, Latin America). Results are presented in three sections:frequency of occurrence of broad clusters of causes and more specific activities (or actor-driven processes) associated with tropical deforestation. patterns of causality (interlinkages) both at the proximate and underlying levels (and between them), in terms of the mode of connection of causesvariations of results other than by broad geographical entities – i.e., by forest type, area size, topography, spatial pattern and process at work, deforestation rate, and poverty- versus capital-driven deforestation.  Finally the paper compares its findings against other empirical evidence on tropical deforestation and conclusions are drawn.Empirical findings versus prevailing explanationsCauses and drivers of tropical deforestation cannot be reduced to a single variable, or to a few variables even. Rather, the interplay of several proximate as well as underlying factors drive deforestation in a synergetic way. While the expansion of cropped land and pasture is clearly the most important proximate cause of tropical deforestation, shifting cultivators are not always the key agentsChain-logical causation in the form of simple tandems (or 2-factor chains) underlies about two thirds of the proximate as well as underlying causes. On average, 4 to 5 tandems are associated with each case of tropical deforestation. Rather than single or direct fundamental causes, underlying driver tandems were identified to be most important. These are mainly economy-, policy and institution - and culture - driven tandems impacting upon the proximate level Population pressure in the form of natural increases in number of population due to high fertility is clearly not the major underlying driving force. Rather, inmigration into forested (not natural increase in densely populated) areas plays an important role in cases of frontier colonization. In all cases, however, population does not operate as a single force but is interlinked with other underlying factors. With view on variations of cause frequencies and causality patterns, there is empirical indication that in cases with high rates of annual deforestation pre-disposing biophysical factors are at work or shape the pattern of deforestation.The explanatory power of PAT variables (population, aff luence, technology) is astonishinglypoor. This model obviously fails to consider policy and institutional factors shaping market opportunities as powerful explanatory factors of tropical deforestation.The multiple factors intervening in tropical deforestation also make it particularly difficult to develop generic and widely applicable policies that best attempt to control the process. Many land-use policies are underlain by simplifications on the drivers of change. Such simplification suggest simple technical solutions and sometimes may serve the interests of critical groups (Lambin et al., 2001). From the results of the meta-analysis it is clear that any universal policy or global attempt to control deforestation (e.g., through poverty alleviation) is doomed to failure.Implications for modelling and controlling deforestationDeforestation is a complex, multiform process which cannot be represented by a mechanistic approach. This has implications for modelling as many of the simulation models of land-use change tend to be mechanistic. The case study evidence examined in this meta-analysis clearly suggests that we still lack an overarching theory to encompass the different factors which intervene in the processes of deforestation.Empirical evidence shows that the complexity and diversity of driving factors of deforestation is reduced when looking at specific processes – e.g., subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture, colonisation activities or logging activities – and specific geographic situations – i.e., frontier areas, roadside areas, peri-urban areas.The overall dominance of the broad cluster of agricultural expansion is well perceived in the modelling of tropical deforestation. However, this is not always the case when it comes more specific agricultural uses and other than agricultural land uses such as logging.Implications for future case study comparisonsThe LUCC research framework proved to be a fruitful platform from which to proceed to develop a general understanding of the drivers of land use and land cover change.Concerning regional representation of case studies in future comprehensive comparisons, the study found that weighting bias in our meta-analysis was low, but also found indication that future work will have to include considerably more African less Asian and about the same number of Latin American cases, Concerning weighting bias in terms of agents involved in the process of deforestation, a better understanding of logging company behaviour and/or industrial forestry plantation activities is requiredFinally the study found a systematic comparison of local-scale case studies is an extremely productive methodology.[authors] ;"H.

eldis:A64940;Reflections on 20 years of land-related development projects in Central America: 10 things you might not expect, and future directions;;Drawing upon several sources of information and types of analysis, including literature reviews, field visits and rapid participatory assessments, this paper provides a critical assessment of land-related development policies and projects over the past two decades in Central America. Reflections on past land-related development policies and projects in Central America are based on their contributions to growth and poverty reduction. The paper calls for future projects to better integrate poverty reduction and development goals, natural resource management, disaster risk management and climate change into a territorial approach stressing local governance and planning. The paper concludes with six specific recommendations, which can serve as the basis for future discussions on the direction of future development support to countries’ land policies and projects in Central America, as well as other regions. ;P.

eldis:A101484;Can workplace secondments build trust in the mining sector?;;"Mutual suspicion has characterised the relationship between the South African government and mining companies, particularly in recent years. Resolving the current impasse would require a panoply of policy interventions because of the complexity and age of the mining industry. This briefing proposes that one such intervention could be the introduction of a structured workplace secondment programme between the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) and mining companies – together identifying critical areas for co-operation and skills transfer. A well-managed and properly resourced secondment programme offers the potential to deepen understanding, share expertise, improve trust and ultimately facilitate a more functional and productive sector. Secondments carry their own risks, but these can be mitigated through rigorous design, and are far outweighed by the risk of doing nothing to alter the status quo. Recommendations:The Department of Mineral Resources should take the lead in establishing a long-term partnership with the private sector for an ongoing workplace secondment programme for public servants into mining companiesthe programme should be assigned sufficient human and financial resources to succeed. It should be co-designed by the government and the private sector; target mutually agreed critical areas for building expertise; and be co-funded by the state and the private sectorrigorous upfront design and consultation should be undertaken to mitigate risks and ensure a coherent and tightly managed process, right through to the secondees’ return to their workplace ";J.

eldis:A45892;Access to water: a woman’s right?;;"Having enough water for food production is a key issue in many countries. As water becomes scarce and food requirements increase, there will be a need to produce more food using less water, to protect the quality of water and the environment, particularly in Africa. To achieve this, it will be necessary to improve women’s access rights to water.Research from
the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations looks at the
issues facing poor communities, and especially women, trying to ensure access
to water. Water is a scarce resource in many countries and water-use
decisions are difficult. However, access to water for poor communities is
necessary if countries are going to meet the first Millennium Development Goal
of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. 
There are many demands for water
in developing countries. 
Irrigation schemes can increase crop production
and enable farmers to diversify into higher value crops.
Rain-fed agriculture relies on moisture
preservation measures and water harvesting. 
Aquaculture provides both income and food. Coastal
and lake fisheries are sustainable because they do not reduce the water supply
and can be combined with other activities.
Food processing and marketing require water for
cooking. These activities provide income in rural and urban areas.
Using water for cooking and washing places a
major burden on supplies and often requires women and children to travel long
distances to fetch supplies.
In most parts of the world, women
play in key role in these activities. Their knowledge of water conditions and
the environment is a vital factor in their ability to provide enough food for
their families. However, very few women own land. Only ten percent of female
farmers own land in India, Nepal and Thailand (even less in other countries)
making it difficult for women to gain access water which is often on other people’s land. 
Water shortages can also cause
problems. With so competing demands on limited water supplies, many regions
need tighter controls over use. One solution would be to raise water prices,
which, in theory, encourage more efficient use, but this is unfair on poor
people and in fact reduces their access to water. 
Policies need to increase poor
people’s access to water, especially landless women. This will require strong
measures such as:

Governments must promote the participation of women
in water resource management. South Africa has already successfully
achieved this.
Women must become active members of water users
associations, including leadership positions.
Women must have more influence in the planning and
management of farm activities. 
Water is needed to restore degraded land. The local
knowledge of both men and women can assist this process, along with an
understanding of the ways poor people use land.

In many places, customs and laws
determine women’s access to water and their role in water-related activities.
These can be hard to overcome, but women must have more influence in determining
patterns of water use and access. This is very important if this increasingly
scarce resource is to be used in the most efficient and productive ways.

eldis:A22343;Vietnam Red River Delta irrigation management: incomplete recognition of local institutional innovations;;Prepared as part of a study on innovations for irrigation management, this report analyses the history of changes and processes around the de-collectivisation of agriculture in Vietnam in the 1980s.At this time, emerging farming households in the Red River Delta became directly involved in agriculture. New water service requirements arose from de-collectivisation. Former irrigation and drainage management companies (IDMC) lowered their involvement in irrigation activities to the benefit of cooperatives that developed local irrigation capacities. The paper asks the questions: How extensive was this evolution? Has this technical evolution had impact on the institutional framework of the activity? To what extent are farming households involved in decision making?The paper finds that the Vietnamese State was not able to combine flexibility with accountability. It combined strong top-level policy with an inability to monitor their implementation at the local level. The present challenge is to create formal room for water management flexibility. This would improve water management if farmer participation is stimulated and cooperative social and collective mandates are respected. ;J-P.

eldis:A17629;Land reform: new seeds on old ground?;;"Following initial enthusiasm in the post-war period, land reform fell out of favour with donors from the early 1970s. Nonetheless, sporadic efforts to redistribute land continued: Ethiopia in 1975, Zimbabwe in 1980 and a renewed commitment to land reform in the Philippines in 1988. These reforms stemmed from shifts in the domestic balance of power between landowners and landless workers and peasants, which were quite independent of donor policies. In the 1990s, decollectivisation and privatisation in the former socialist economies have provided a new dimension to land reform; so too has majority rule in South Africa, where the racially- skewed ownership of land is under challenge and where market-based measures to achieve land redistribution in favour of blacks are being tried. In the Philippines non-market policies are being supported by donors, now that the Cold War is over. Whereas the geographical context and individual country strategies may be new, the range of land reform measures being adopted and the implementation problems encountered are not.

eldis:A25425;How prices and macroeconomic policies affect agricultural supply and the environment;;There is clearly a link between agricultural incentives and the environment, but quantitative data on such topics as soil quality and land use are inadequate for sound analysis.Mamingi studies the literature on how agricultural prices and macroeconomic policies affect agricultural supply and how that supply affects the environment. He addresses the question of how effective agricultural incentives are in boosting the agricultural supply, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.Certain generalizations are common in the literature: Farmers are rational. They increase their output in response to an increase in real output prices. The agricultural supply response is inelastic in the short run (as low as 0.02), but elasticities for individual crops are generally higher than those for aggregate output. Elasticities are higher in the long run than in the short.In theory, if farmers are rational, if output responds to price increases, measures should be taken to eliminate price distortion. But, Mamingi points out, our understanding of the quantitative dimensions of the agricultural supply response is surprisingly weak. He points to four potential sources of bias in the estimates: The simultaneity of variables is disregarded in many studies, although most variables are jointly determined in agriculture.  Bias results from the omission of such key variables as roads (density and quality), population, education, and land characteristics.  Bias results from improper pooling of data from different countries. In many cases, results are very sensitive to the degree of pooling. Moreover, some variables  the consumer price index among them  are not directly comparable across countries.  In most time series studies, the aggregate supply response is treated as reversible, but according to fixed asset (or sticky asset) theory, the supply response is irreversible. Output is more responsive to price increases than to price decreases, as land, trees, buildings, and equipment acquired when prices were high are not discarded when prices are low.There is clearly a link between agricultural incentives and the environment: an increase in agricultural supply  mainly through expansion of the area cultivated  can lead to erosion, sedimentation, soil degradation, and a reduction in natural habitat. But quantitative data on relevant aspects of the subject  for example, on soil quality and land use  are very inadequate.This paper  a product of the Environment, Infrastructure, and Agriculture Division, Policy Research Department  is part of a larger effort in the department to understand the impact of macroeconomic policies on growth, poverty, and the environment.

eldis:A70981;Climate Change, Out-migration and Agrarian Stress: The Potential for Upscaling Small-scale Water Storage in Nepal;;"This report explores the potential role of small-scale water storage infrastructure in two subbasins within the larger Koshi River Basin in central and eastern Nepal, yet shows that upscaling such infrastructure requires an appreciation of the other drivers of change in agriculture aside from climate (e.g., rising cost of living and poor terms of trade for agriculture). It also identifies the social relations and dynamics (distribution of land, water and labour) which could mediate the success of future interventions. It is clear from the research that, while small-scale water storage has the potential to significantly strengthen livelihoods in the Nepali hills, it is necessary to tailor projects to the existing political-economic context.

eldis:A44268;Modes of land access and welfare impacts in Uganda;;This paper estimates the poverty reducing impact of land access in rural Uganda. The paper firstly states that land acquired through markets or otherwise may play an important role for rural household welfare. Conversely, there are concerns that poverty reduction effect of access to land through the market may be inadequate, due to land markets that can increase land concentration among the rich and inefficient producers. In this context, the paper argues that poverty reduction effect of land can be effective when more efficient farmers are able to acquire additional land through a mode of land access with stronger welfare increasing effects.The paper notes that land, whether accessed through the market or not, is an important determinant of household welfare. Indeed, households with more of owned land, operated land, or market-accessed land would gain a significant welfare-improving effect of better land access. However, this is conditioned to controlling for both endogeneity in land access and unobserved heterogeneity effects on welfare. The paper's findings indicate significant poverty reduction effects of increased land access in form of owned, operated and market-accessed land. Furthermore, the poverty reduction effect for land accessed through the market was significantly larger than the poverty reduction effect of land accessed through inheritance. The paper argues that this is likely to be the case because land markets, to a larger extent, transfer land to more efficient producers. The paper concludes that land markets enhance efficiency as well as contribute to poverty reduction. ;"A. Tatwangire

eldis:A39239;Browsing on fences: pastoral land rights, livelihoods and adaptation to climate change;;"This paper presents an overview of pastoral systems and addresses rights issues around access and control of resources in the context of climate change. The document brings together the inputs made by over 120 participants in a 2006 web-based forum and also includes material from a number of projects from around the world.While more needs to be understood about the likely impacts of climate change on different environments, this paper focuses on the main factors that will make herding communities most likely to gain or lose from these challenges.Some of the key points highlighted include:

    pastoralists’ vulnerability to climatic variability is less a function of declining resources than a result of their increasing inability to respond to such changes
    social, political and economic marginalisation is a keyword that explains pastoralists’ current inability to deal with and adapt to changes, including environmental ones 
    the merging of pastoralists and farmers has weakened relations between the groups, and heightened competition for access to natural resources 
    enhancing pastoralist entitlement to a wider range of resources, both agro-ecological and socio-economic, and enabling them to use such resources as needed, is vital to reducing their vulnerability and enhancing the sustainable development of marginal lands
    climate change may offer a new framework with which to approach pastoralism, and to take stock of its capacities for production on marginal and unpredictable lands, in an environmentally sustainable manner. 

The paper recommends key controversial issues that need to be addressed by national policies and international development assistance with respect to pastoral development in a context of climate change. These include: 

    pastoralism should gain recognition by policy makers as a viable system with the potential to sustain livelihoods
    pastoralists need to be acknowledged as good custodians of variable environments
    pastoralists need to benefit from the economic wealth generated by the exploitation of the rich underground resources
    appropriate changes in government opinion and policy directives towards pastoralism needs to be initiated.

eldis:A69218;Climate change, conflict, and cooperation: global analysis of the resilience of international river treaties to increased water variability;;"This paper focuses on water variability which is predicted to increase due to climate change. It highlights that such environmental changes may aggravate political tensions, especially in regions that are not equipped with an appropriate institutional apparatus.

This paper argues that the best attempts to assess the ability of states to deal with water variability in the future rest with considering how agreements have fared in the past. The paper investigates to what extent particular mechanisms and institutional designs help mitigate inter-country tensions over shared water. The study’s findings suggest that country dyads governed by treaties with water allocation mechanisms exhibiting both flexibility and specificity evince more co-operative behaviour. Country dyads governed by treaties with a larger sum of institutional mechanisms likewise evince a higher level of cooperation, although certain institutional mechanisms are more important than others.

Policy brief 67 Helen Dancer
There are gender-differentiated impacts when land is harnessed for commercial investment. Land policy needs to address the gendered nature of power relations within families and land tenure systems, and the implications of rural social relations on processes of community consultation, land management and dispute settlement. Without this, land investment policies will not reach their goals of tenure security for all, agricultural productivity and increased revenue. From the outset the full participation of women as well as men, good local leadership and gender-sensitive business practices at the local level are needed, to ensure that the fruits of land-based investment deals in the countryside are gender-equitable.

eldis:A27817;Impact of Access to Credit on the Poor: Research Design and Baseline Survey for a Longitudinal Study;;Presents the baseline survey for a study of the impact of microfinance services offered by Alalay sa Kaunlaran sa Gitnang Luzon, Inc (ASKI). ASKI is a microfinance institution based in Cabanatuan City in the Philippines, and is a member of the BWTP Network.The baseline survey is the first step in a longitudinal process. There have been comparatively few studies in the Philippines of the impact of microfinance on poor clients. Moreover, in the Philippines as elsewhere, very few studies have featured a longitudinal design which commences with the careful collection of baseline data concerning the target population. This study is designed to address that gap. The report sets out in detail the research design for the study. The dependent variables, which are to be measured over time to indicate impact, cover matters such as income, expenditure, assets, land and housing, level of economic activity, saving and borrowing behaviour, role in household decision-making, and participation in community activities.

eldis:A13956;Child farm labor: the wealth paradox;;This paper is motivated by the observation that children in land-rich households are often more likely to be in work than the children of land-poor households.The vast majority of working children in developing countries are in agricultural work, predominantly on farms operated by their families. Land is the most important store of wealth in agrarian societies and it is typically distributed very unequally. These facts challenge the common presumption that child labour emerges from the poorest households. This article suggests that this seeming paradox can be explained by failures of the markets for labour and land. Credit market failure will tend to weaken the force of this paradox. These effects are modeled and estimates obtained using survey data from rural Pakistan and Ghana.The main findings are that in both Ghana and Pakistan the daughters of land-rich households are more likely to work than the daughters of land-poor households, even after controlling for household resources and other relevant household, child, and community characteristics. Introducing control variables mitigates the paradoxical patterns in the data for boys. The estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that the wealth paradox can be explained in terms of imperfections in land and labor markets.  This effect appears to dominate any effect of credit market imperfections.The main policy implications of these findings are:Given that the majority of working children in developing countries work on family-run farms, some of the policies that have recently received attention from economic theorists and journalists interested in child labour (minimum wage legislation, trade sanctions) have limited direct relevance to the problemThe results highlight the gender differential in work and school participation and identify gender differences in the determinants of child labour. They are a useful guide to interventions designed to close the gender gap. In Pakistan, where the gender gap is enormous, closing the gender gap would substantially reduce overall child work participation ratesThe finding that farm size increases child labor suggests that, at given levels of household income, the return to work relative to the return to school is a significant determinant of child labor, especially among girls. A natural policy implication is therefore to invest in raising the returns to education. Additional incentives for the attendance of girls in schools should be consideredPolicies that improve the functioning of labor and land markets in rural areas will reduce child labor, especially of girls ;"S.

eldis:A100475;A stitch in time: preventive diplomacy and the Lake Malawi dispute;;A low-intensity dispute between Malawi and Tanzania threatens regional peace as the two countries contest the demarcation of their national boundaries at Lake Malawi. This long-standing dispute became more urgent when in 2011 the Malawian government issued licences for oil prospecting beneath the lake’s northern shoreline. Although tensions have waxed and waned in accordance with the respective countries’ election cycles, both seek a speedy resolution of this dispute. Potential oil revenues are a significant game changer for these two highly indebted poor countries – but perhaps more so for Malawi, which is less endowed with natural resources. In the absence of a functioning SADC Tribunal to mediate the dispute, the task has been assigned to the Forum for Former African Heads of State and Government, but there are also other regional mechanisms that could assist with the task. In particular, it falls within the purview of the many early-warning mechanisms in SADC and the AU that already exist and whose raison d’être is to prevent the escalation of disputes. This paper explores the failures and challenges that plague Africa’s preventive diplomacy institutions and advocates that the region would do well to empower these institutions. This would foster stronger and more legitimate regional institutions that would be better able to act decisively on dispute settlement. It is apparent from this paper that there are a number of bodies that are concerned with the resolution of disputes such as the one posed by the Lake Malawi/Nyasa dispute. Although these institutions are aware of the problem to varying degrees, there is little to suggest that they are able to co-ordinate efforts among themselves, or in the service of the governments in question. Arguably, the fortification of these institutions at regional and sub-regional levels would depoliticise much of the process and inch the continent towards stronger, more transparent and democratic outcomes. ;A.

eldis:A72045;The search for a model land legislation: the new land bill and its challenges;;"The draft Indian Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on September 7, 2011 is one of the most important legislations waiting for Parliamentary approval. In its present form, the bill is a major improvement over the archaic 1894 land law that has contributed to the impasse over land acquisitions across the country. The bill makes a genuine push for a better land acquisition regime in the country by doing three things: combining both compensations, resettlement and
rehabilitation (R&R) into a single bill; raising the prospects of better compensation and R&R for millions of land owners and other project stakeholders; and reposing some faith in participatory grassroots institutions such as Gram Sabha in the acquisition process.

On the other hand, the proposed legislation fails on many fronts to address some of the vexed issues on land acquisition. It fails, for example, to read the land market which is witnessing a major transformation due to rapid changes in the economy, industry and urbanization in the country. Even as the government resolves some of these policy loopholes and contradictions, the new legislation faces an uncertain future for a wide variety of reasons. The key objectives of the new law would remain nothing more than rhetoric in the absence of accompanying administrative and structural changes in the nature of governance system and systemic efforts to clean the land market and free it from the influence of parties with vested interest, particularly the political class, officials, and the land mafia.

eldis:A11799;Fine grain-Finance:  financial choice and strategy among the poor in rural North India;;This report gives a description of the financial life of residents with a limited basis for  cash-crop and off-farm opportunities, hence restricting them to size of landholding as a  critical indicator of wealth and status and  influences access to cheap bank finance.The authors demonstrates that the use of informal mechanisms like reciprocal gifts, interest-free lending and borrowing and taking credit in kind from shopkeepers, is widespread and does not decrease with increasing wealth. As one goes up the wealth scale, it was found that respondents regularly accessed an increasing number and range of devices, including those used by poorer respondents. As such, within this region, greater access to the formal sector does not preclude use of informal mechanisms. The report also revealed the following:Use of bank credit is open only to a minority whose landholdings are generally above 5-7 acres.In order to become a force for change, banks will need to increase their outreach even within the agricultural sector and to develop policies and products which promote innovation and higher value cropping. These might include financing the development of market and storage infrastructure for cash crops, tie-ups with seed and buy-back companies and schemes to facilitate the purchase and lease of land.For the poorest among the Farmer-Labourers, access to any institutional finance will depend on their capacity to build up an asset base which allows them to manage shocks and contemplate higher wage (but more risky) income options.[Adapted from Author] ;"O.

eldis:A11012;Zoning—lessons from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;;"Over the last 25 years a range of management ‘tools’, including zoning plans, permits, education, and more recently management plans, have been applied to regulate access and to control and mitigate impacts associated with human use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park GBRMP.A multiple-use zoning approach provides high levels of protection for speci c areas whilst allowing reasonable uses, including certain  shing activities, to continue in other zones. Zoning has long been regarded as a cornerstone of Marine Park management,
separating con icting uses through application of the various zones and determining the appropriateness of various activities. Zoning in the GBRMP has evolved and changed considerably since the  rst zoning plan in 1981, along with other management approaches.This paper outlines what aspects of zoning have worked well, what has necessarily changed, and the zoning lessons learned from over two decades of ‘adaptive management’.

eldis:A70534;Supporting livelihoods through the protection of natural capital: A case study of the Agulhas Plain;;"Ecosystems are a form of natural capital. Invasions by introduced alien plant species alter ecosystems, often reducing supplies of valuable ecosystem goods and services and imposing substantial costs on South Africa’s economy. Reversing these losses by removing alien plants imposes further costs because clearing and control operations are expensive. However, the high costs can be offset by the benefits of creating employment opportunities through such operations and the livelihood benefits that can be derived from the cleared land.

Using the Agulhas Plain as an example, this policy brief compares two different post-clearing land-use options that can be used to support livelihoods in the area, namely: restoring natural capital to allow wildflower harvesting, or using the land for bioenergy production. The different costs and benefits associated with each option are illustrated, together with guidelines about how to deal with selecting post-clearing land-use options.

eldis:A69842;Urban management: the redevelopment of the Mitchells plain town centre;;"Mitchells Plain is about 20km from the Cape Town city centre. It was built in the 1970s as a township for people classified as ‘Coloured’, who were forcibly removed from areas that had been declared ‘whites only’ under the Group Areas Act. Various attempts were made to upgrade the Mitchells Plain Town Centre (MPTC) after the advent of democracy in 1994, but these were disjointed and lacked a champion to drive the process. In 2001, national government launched the Urban Renewal Programme (URP) to address infrastructure deficiencies and declining economies in areas characterised by widespread poverty and neglect.

This study looks at the township redevelopment project of Mitchells Plain centre and makes recommendations for efficiency. Mitchells Plain is a typical example of apartheid spatial planning, which relegated the residents of townships to the margins of economic activity. The area is effectively a dormitory town with a great deal of vacant, unsafe space. Along with a number of adjacent townships established for Africans, Mitchells Plain is isolated from the rest of the city. It is surrounded by geographical barriers and distant from amenities and economic opportunities. It suffers from high levels of poverty, crime and gang violence.

At the time of the 2001 census, 305 343 people were reported to live in Mitchells Plain in 67 746 households. Most lived in houses (65 per cent), 20 per cent lived in town/cluster houses, and about 6 per cent lived in shacks in informal settlements. Afrikaans was the most common home language (50 per cent of households) followed by English (37 per cent) and Xhosa (12 per cent).

The project was targeted at creating a safe, convenient, seamless environment for public transport users, the project team sought to create a safe and pleasant environment for shoppers, to boost informal trading activity in a prime location, to provide opportunities for further retail development, and to generate opportunities for other economic development activities, such as training institutions.

Some of the lesson learnt from this project include building community consensus, sticking with the process, being solution-oriented, getting high-level political buy-in, avoiding a ‘perfect’ plan, being flexible enough to accommodate community needs, constantly revisiting budgets, build good relationships with key officials amongst others.

eldis:A101023;Land, farming and Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): a case study of the Middle Manyame Sub-Catchment;;Zimbabwe's water reforms that were undertaken in the 1990s were meant to redress the colonially inherited inequalities to agricultural water, increase water security against frequent droughts, improve water management, and realise sustainable financing of the water sector. They were underpinned by the 1998 Water and Zimbabwe National Water Authority Acts, which were based on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principles. This article describes how IWRM has been implemented against a backdrop of an ever - ev olving land reform programme and a struggling agriculture sector. We examine how water is accessed and used in and around three water sources in the Middle Manyame Sub-Catchment, one of the seven sub-catchments of the Manyame Catchment. The Sub-Catchment is of particular significance because there was significant agricultural production on white-owned large-scale farmers, which have now been extensively allocated to small black farmers. The study demonstrated that while the land reform has, in theory, broad ened access to water, irrigation water usage has remained low because of a depressed agriculture sector, shortage and high costs of electricity, and lack of capital needed to restore damaged or stolen irrigation equipment. The findings indicate that the as sumption of a self-financing water sector, based on a well-functioning agriculture sector, which is the largest water user, has not been realised, and this has negatively affected implementation of IWRM in the Middle Manyame area and in Zimbabwe in general. ;"Takunda Hove

eldis:A11151;Potential carbon mitigation and income in developing countries from changes in use and management of agricultural and forest lands;;This paper explores the opportunities for mitigating atmospheric carbon emissions and generating development income in developing countries through a combination of sustainable agricultural practices on existing lands, slowing tropical deforestation, and reforesting degraded lands.The analysis shows that over the next ten years, forty-eight major tropical and subtropical developing countries have the potential to reduce the atmospheric carbon burden by about 2.2 billion tonnes of carbon. Given a central price of $10 tonne of carbon and a discount rate of 3%, this mitigation would generate a net present value of about $16.1 billion collectively for these countries. Achieving these potentials would require a significant global effort, covering more than fifty million hectares of land, to implement carbon-friendly practices in agriculture, forest, and previously forested lands.Estimates of host-country income potentials do not  consider that outside financial investment may or may not be available and take no account of the additional benefits of carbon sequestration in forest soils undergoing reforestation, increased use of biomass, and reduced use of fossil fuel inputs and reduced agricultural emissions.Realising these incomes would necessitate substantially greater policy support and investment in sustainable land uses than is currently the case. ;"J.

eldis:A101024;Whose waters? Large-scale agricultural development and water grabbing in the Wami-Ruvu River Basin, Tanzania;;In Tanzania like in other parts of the global South, in the name of 'development' and 'poverty eradication' vast tracts of land have been earmarked by the government to be developed by investors for different commercial agricultural projects, giving rise to the contested land grab phenomenon. In parallel, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM ) has been promoted in the country and globally as the governance framework that seeks to manage water resources in an efficient, equitable and sustainable manner. This article asks how IWRM manages the competing interests as well as the diverse priorities of both large and small water users in the midst of foreign direct investment. By focusing on two commercial sugar companies operating in the Wami-Ruvu River Basin in Tanzania and their impacts on the water and land rights of the surrounding villages, the article asks whether institutional and capacity weaknesses around IWRM implementation can be exploited by powerful actors that seek to meet their own interests, thus allowing water grabbing to take place. The paper thus highlights the power, interests and alliances of the various actors involved in the governance of water resources. By drawing on recent conceptual insights from the water grabbing literature, the empirical findings suggest that the IWRM framework indirectly and directly facilitates the phenomenon of water grabbing to take place in the Wami-Ruvu River Basin in Tanzania. ;"Aurelia van Eeden

eldis:A68414;Water, food and energy nexus challenges;;"Comprehensive yet concise report outlining the key challenges and projected demands in the global agricultural sector, from an energy-water-food nexus perspective.
Based on several existing data-sets, this paper by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development seeks to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of the main challenges associated with increasing demand for agricultural products. The authors use the concept of a water-energy-food nexus, viewing agriculture in a multi-sectoral and integrated fashion that incorporates land management, water use, demand projections, energy use, markets, climate change impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions . The paper assumes a business-as-usual scenario in formulating projected supply and demand trends and climate change impacts, indicating the need for a proposed “Green New Deal” that tackles multiple areas simultaneously to tap into different cost and benefit streams and enhance co-optimisation. 
The report summarises the projections and challenges, including that:
Food demand is expected to increase by 60 per cent by 2050 compared to 2005-2007 levels, due to population growth (70 per cent) and increased per capita calorie intake (30 per cent). Global meat demand is expected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030.
Demand for roundwood, wood panels, and paper are expected to rise between 1 per cent and 4.1 per cent annually for the next two decades, while demand for biofuel is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. 
Around 90 per cent of the required increase of food production has to come from intensification. While globally arable land is expected to increase in by 4.5 per cent, in developed countries it is expected to decrease by 40 million hectares.  
Regarding impacts on water, it is expected that by 2050, irrigated agriculture covering 16 per cent of cultivated land will be responsible for 44 per cent of all crop production. However, greater competition for water from other sectors could reduce the water available for agriculture by 18 per cent.
Climate change impacts on agriculture include higher temperatures leading to more variable annual production levels, decreasing yields and nutritional value of crops, and increased costs and fertiliser use.  
Global energy demand is projected to increase by 80% by 2050. The food sector currently accounts for 30 per cent of global energy use, and agricultural commodity prices are highly sensitive to energy prices.
Energy and the food system, including land-use change, account for almost half of global greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, emissions will increase by 50% between 2012 and 2050.
Increased salinity of soil, the build-up of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds through agricultural water pollution, and drinking water contaminated with high nitrate concentrations all pose significant challenges.

eldis:A63801;Governing the forests: an institutional analysis of REDD+ and community forest management in Asia;;"This report examines the history, structure and monitoring mechanisms of REDD+ to better understand how it impacts upon, and interacts with, Community Forest Management (CFM). It presents case studies of CFM and REDD+ governance from Bangladesh, Indonesia and India, and concludes with some lessons learned.REDD+ is an example of multilevel governance that uses a variety of institutional structures and processes aimed at promoting sustainable management of forests, including financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. At the national level, countries have their own systems of governance, often jointly managed by multiple interests, including CFM. Having given an overview of REDD+ itself, the paper explores how REDD+ influences and reacts to local circumstances.The case studies feature different aspects of CFM and REDD+ governance. The paper highlights the emerging role of CFM in reducing carbon emissions in Bangladesh, presents lessons from the implementation of a public/private partnership in Indonesia and explores indigenous carbon management practices in India.Conclusions drawn from the case studies on challenges and implications for REDD+ governance include the following.

    The role of forest stocks in international regimes requires clarification; forest stocks must be managed in ways that incentivise communities and governments to avoid deforestation and degradation, whilst remaining sensitive to the needs of forest-dependent communities.
    Local government capacity must be sufficiently strengthened so as to provide support in connecting local and global governance. 
    There is a need to link carbon management with local practices and economic activities; community forums should be established to allow all stakeholders to collaborate and explore strategies that harness local opportunities for income diversification.
    Issues of land tenure and carbon rights must be clarified and strengthened to provide lasting security to forest-dependent communities.
    Monitoring, reporting and verifying the participation of all stakeholders requires greater effort and resources.
    Protocols are required for resolving ecological problems and dispute settlements; interaction should be more informal and decisions made by consensus rather than majority rule.

eldis:A32894;Vedanta cares?: tusting the myths about Vedanta’s operation in Lanjigarh, India;;"This report investigates the threats to the livelihoods of Indian Lanjigarh locals after the arrival of a subsidiary of Vedanta. It presents the myths about Vedanta in relation to this project and unravels the truth behind each with evidence from official reports, journalists, Action Aid’s own field visits and first hand accounts of local people. The locals of Niyamgiri mountain, in Kalahandi District, Orissa, India have lived for decades by foraging in the forests, raising chickens and growing vegetables and rice. Families are living in fear for their future due to the arrival of Vedanta’s bauxite mining and alumina refinery project. Villagers claim to have been involuntarily displaced from their homes and refused compensation for their lost land, and yet their protests have been repeatedly ignored by officials and the company. Local campaigning groups are making calls to action. These include: 

    Vedanta must halt all mining and refining activities in Lanjigarh and the Niyamgiri mountain area. This should include a halt to further construction work and deforestation and any transportation of bauxite 
    the Government of India and the Government of Orissa must recognise that the project represents a fundamental violation of Indian environmental and human rights laws
    to protect communities, global minimum human rights standards for companies must be developed within the UN, backed by international complaints mechanisms for communities to seek justice at the United Nations Human Rights Council.

eldis:A58967;Migration and land rental as risk response in rural China;;"Households in developing countries take various actions to smooth income or consumption as a means of managing or responding to risk. This paper examines migration and land rental market participation as responses to risk in rural China. 
The authors show that over the last 30 years, there have been significant reforms in China, which have increased labour mobility and the functioning of rural land markets. The authors emphasise that while limitations still remain, the reforms have to date increased the efficiency of the allocation of these important factors of production. 
The document’s findings are listed below: 

    the nature of exposure to risk affects people’s ability to manage risks
    individual shocks can often be managed through intra-village insurance arrangements such as risk-sharing arrangements or social safety nets
    however, these strategies work primarily because the shocks that are insured through these strategies are not widespread 
    as a result, individual income risks do not affect household rental market participation
    nevertheless, risks threatening households increase land rental market participation, but decrease participation in migration
    because death in a household reduces a household’s redundant labour, these individual labour shocks significantly lower the likelihood that a household will participate in migration

eldis:A71800;Peru’s deadly environment: the rise in killings of environmental and land defenders;;"The world’s attention was be on Peru December 2014, as governments from 195 countries convened in the capital Lima for the UN Climate Conference. As delegates negotiated a global deal aimed at averting catastrophic climate change, a parallel human rights crisis is still unfolding in Peru and around the world. An increasing number of people on the frontline of the fight to protect the environment are being killed.

The recent murders of Peruvian indigenous leader Edwin Chota and three of his colleagues, who died trying to defend their land in the Amazon from illegal logging, are part of a global trend in violent crime against activists. Global Witness research, published earlier this year, shows that on average, two such ‘environmental and land’ defenders are being killed each week around the world, a rate that has been increasing in recent years. Governments aren’t doing enough to stop it.

As global demand for natural resources intensifies, more and more ordinary people are having to defend their rights to land and the environment from corporate or state abuse. Many of the killings stem from conflicts over the ownership and use of land, particularly in the face of expanded mining and logging activities. An estimated 93% of extractive and agriculture projects happen on land that is already inhabited. The author's research found that Peru is the world’s fourth deadliest country to be an environmental or land defender, behind Brazil, Honduras and the Philippines. Between 2002 and 2014, at least 57 such activists were killed in Peru. More than half died during the last four years.

eldis:A72587;What climate services do farmers and pastoralists need in Tanzania?;;This report presents final findings from the baseline data collection exercise conducted for Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) Adaptation Programme in Africa. The GFCS programme, having a focus on agriculture, food security, health and disaster risk reduction, is implemented in Tanzania and Malawi. Under the auspices of this GFCS project, the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) is responsible to support baseline data collection and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to evaluate climate services for farmers and pastoralists in Tanzania. The purpose of this report is to inform national partners on farmers’ current access and needs for climate information services. Communities of agro-pastoralists and pastoralists interviewed have little access to climate information, which is generally not associated with agricultural advice. To increase the relevance and communication of climate information in their communities, respondents have recommended training of local extension agents and traditional leaders on the concepts of climate information, having site specific information and using local languages and brochures. The forecasts of greatest interest include start of the rain and expected amount of rainfall over the season. Preferred formats cited by men are radio messages, visits from extension agents while women selected voice message on cell phones and villages communicators. Messengers suggested for radio presenters, local extension agents and village leaders highly recommended by women. The Adaptation Program in Africa, which targets Tanzania and Malawi, is the first multi-agency initiative to be implemented under GFCS. It is a 3-year project, funded by the Government of Norway, that aims to strengthen capacity both to develop and use climate services and combines cutting-edge science with traditional knowledge. ;J.Y.

eldis:A60370;Mitigating greenhouse gases in agriculture;;"Prepared by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture, this in-depth report seeks to shed light on the climate mitigation potential of agriculture. It argues that with an increasing demand for food, global agriculture will soon become the dominant area of greenhouse emissions, with the two main sources being nitrous oxide from the soil and methane from animal farming (of particular concern as developing countries convert increasingly to a high-protein, 'western', diet). The scientific case for the significance of agricultural emissions is presented in parts one to six of the report. As well as presenting data detailing agriculture's share of total global emissions, it breaks down emissions region-by-region and within agricultural sub-sectors. Carbon sequestration is discussed, including information on soil types, fertilizers, and crop selection and management. Current regional trends in agriculture and mitigation, such as the general decline in agricultural emissions in the developing world, are provided within the context of global trends that indicate dangerous increases in nitrous oxides and methane in the coming decades. With such significant emissions, agriculture represents a huge opportunity for mitigation strategies; as such the authors argue that nothing less than a new climate-friendly agricultural paradigm is needed. The core principles of such a new paradigm must:

    account for trade-offs and synergies and adopt a systematic approach
    look beyond mitigation, i.e. adaptation and food-security 
    be aware of and prepare for uncertainties and knowledge gaps 
    include strategies targeting consumption and wastage before making extensive policy recommendations of their own.

Amongst the areas covered are the potential use of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in mitigation, the effect of climate change on rice production and the need for tight monitoring of bio-fuel production in Brazil. Policy recommendations are extensive and cover all the research areas presented throughout the report, including specific policy recommendations for the UN, the EU, Brazil and Indonesia. They cover the five primary goals identified through the research: 

    increase soil carbon 
    realise closed nutrient cycles 
    change consumption and waste patterns 
    improve scientific knowledge of nitrous oxide dynamics 
    develop optimal assessment methods.

eldis:A15214;Land and schooling: transferring wealth across generations;;This article, a summary of the book sharing the same title, examines issues around the allocation of land and education within families.  Based on household surveys in Ghana, Indonesia and the Philippines, the book attempts to answer key questions, including:How do parents allocate land and education between sons and daughters?How do changing returns to land and human capital affect parents’ investments in children?What do gender differences in land and  schooling mean for the welfare of men and women?Is gender equity compatible with efficiency and growth?The authors find that:in the Philippines, where farming is much more intensive in male labour, sons inherit more land, and daughters receive more schoolingin Indonesia, in areas where men work primarily on rubber agroforestry and women specialise in lowland paddy production, men inherit rubber fields and women inherit paddy fields.  In schooling investments, men and women were treated equally.in Ghana women contribute about 30 percent of the labour required in cocoa farming and own nearly 30 percent of cocoa land.  However, women were disfavoured in both land transfers and schooling, although this gender gap has been appreciably reduced over time.The implications of these findings for policy include:policies must extend and strengthen schooling systems in rural areas and increase women's educational attainment:parents' decisions to invest in girls' education are more sensitive to the price of education, the quality of schooling, the extent of learning, and teacher attitudes than are their decisions to invest in boys' educationinvestments that reduce distance to school, as well as investments in basic water and energy infrastructure, can help female enrolment rates in part by reducing the opportunity cost of schooling for girlspolicies must promote competition in non-farm labour markets so as to eliminate discrimination against women. Investments in time-saving infrastructure, such as adequate childcare, can reduce women's opportunity costs of participating in the labour marketin labour-constrained economies, new technologies could make women's labour more productive by, for instance, improving the efficiency of food processing or fuel collection.[adapted from author] ;"A.R.

eldis:A101933;Legal limits to tribal governance:  coal mining in Meghalaya, India;;Land in Meghalaya, India, was traditionally agricultural land, owned by the community. With increasing privatization and rising commercial value of land for non-agricultural use, many owners have sold the land for mining operations. So-called rat-hole coal mining has resulted in environmental degradation as well as in the loss of lives of miners, most of whom are from outside the state. The National Green Tribunal has banned coal mining until safer, more environmentally sound policies and practices are in place. Critics in Meghalaya claim that the ban encroaches on the tribal way of life and point to constitutional provisions exempting Meghalaya from the purview of national mining laws. However, the courts are clear: Meghalaya’s exemptions do not allow them to violate the constitutional right to life of all Indian citizens. The traditional institutions are not strong enough to mitigate the rising inequality among citizens following from mining and other commercial operations. ;H. Stokke;;Chr.

eldis:A41339;Malawi's green gold: challenges and opportunities for small and medium forest enterprises in reducing poverty;;"Approximately 85% of Malawi’s population live in rural areas and depend in some way on forests for their livelihoods. Recent government policies have highlighted how forest resources could do more to help reduce poverty through the development of small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs). This scoping  study describes the main opportunities and constraints facing SMFEs in Malawi.The authors draw on field-based interviews with entrepreneurs involved in four different forest product value chains - plantation timber, cane furniture, fruit juice and wood carving - and an analysis of national policies and how they affect SMFEs.The study finds that, excluding cane products, the demand for most SMFE products seems strong. As a  result, the increasing pressure that SMFEs put on the forest is a major challenge, both for them and the country. The perception that SMFEs are acting illegally and pose a threat to the natural environment may translate into more hostile government policies. However, the advantage of SMFEs is that the resource on which they depend is renewable if properly managed. International demand is high for ‘natural’ and  community-based’ products which offers an opportunity for SMFEs to reduce local poverty through their businesses.The implications for government policy include:

    there is a need for champions of SMFEs to clearly articulate to government and NGOs that SMFEs can play a role in the sustainable management of forest resources
    there is also a need to demonstrate the potential of the SMFE sector as an engine for economic growth and poverty reduction
    security of resource access is key to encouraging financial service providers to offer affordable credit to SMFEs - potential investors must also be helped to see the SMFE subsector as an area with potential for growth and investment
    governments should consider creating credit guarantee schemes and a credit reference bureau to assist SMFEs to access loans from non-government finance institutions
    to achieve economies of scale, improve production processes and encourage further investment, producer associations must be formed and strengthened - this can be achieved through training and encouraging the formation of a full-time secretariat
    while the majority of current policies and programmes appear to be supportive of SMFEs, the Department of Forestry should play a more proactive role in developing SMFEs, not just in monitoring and controlling forest use.

eldis:A25511;Research on Land Markets in South Asia: What Have We Learned?;;"What have we learned about land markets in South Asia  about land reform, land fragmentation, sharecropping, security of tenure, farm size, land rights, transaction costs, bargaining power, policy distortions, and market imperfections (including those associated with gender)?Faruqee and Carey review the literature on land markets in South Asia to clarify what's known and to highlight unresolved issues. They report that:  We have a good understanding of why sharecropping persists and why it can be superior to other standard agricultural contracts. We have less understanding of what determines the relative efficiency of sharecropping in different environments and why other apparently superior contractual relationships are rare.  Insecure rights to land adversely affect production and investment incentives in areas outside of South Asia, but in South Asia strong evidence linking investment and rights to production is scarce.  An inverse relationship between farm size and output per unit area is a recurrent feature in data from South Asia, apparently related to land labor interactions.  Although small farms seem to be more efficient than large ones, small farmers have trouble raising their profitability and enlarging their holding, largely because of credit constraints but also because of poverty and policy that discriminates against them.  Misguided land reform in the past has made tenancy unattractive to landowners, so large capital intensive farms have developed. Political economic analysis is needed to explain the failure of past land reform, as well as distortions in agricultural input and output markets in South Asia.  Land fragmentation (as distinguished from farm size) has caused productivity losses. Those losses have not been quantified and the reasons fragmentation persists are poorly understood.  Transaction costs are a significant impediment to functioning land markets. In South Asia, transfers of land rights are complicated by lack of explicit title to land, and by informal and customary rights.  One pressing research problem is gender discrimination, an important factor in land market imperfections  especially (within the household) the separation of land management and its control.Research needs include more systematic regional comparisons, the use of more panel data, and an investigation of how agricultural productivity is affected by gender problems and land fragmentation.This paper  a product of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Division, Country Department I, South Asia  is part of a larger effort in the department to identify policy questions related to land markets in South Asia. The study was funded by the Bank's Research Support Budget under the research preparation grant ""Land Market Imperfections in South Asia"" (RPO 68012).

eldis:A61846;Development of a Gender Concept for the Forests and Climate Change Programme (FORCLIME) in Indonesia;;The Forests and Climate Change Programme (FORCLIME) is a collaborative initiative implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. The project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the forestry sector and improve the livelihoods of Indonesia’s poor rural communities. This report outlines the results of a gender analysis of Indonesia’s forestry sector undertaken to inform the design of a gender strategy for FORCLIME. The report’s findings are derived from institutional analysis, based on literature reviews, focus groups and interviews, and participatory analysis, undertaken in a forest community in West-Kalimantan. The report concludes with a set of recommendations for gender mainstreaming and women empowerment and then outlines elements of a gender strategy for FORCLIME. ;E.

eldis:A18779;Investment in land, tenure security and area farmed in northern Mozambique;;The analysis of land investment and tenure security usually assumes land scarcity. However, some developing countries have communities with land abundance. This article therefore examines the effects of land abundance for investment and tenure security. The author finds that in contrast to the literature, area farmed is a determinant of investment and tenure security. However, no link exists between investment and tenure security. These findings have strong implications for rural development policy in land abundant communities.These findings have potentially serious implications for the design of rural development policies in land abundant tropical agriculture. Rather than the modification of formal land rights regimes,  agricultural development may benefit  from:removing social and institutional inequalities in land accesscapitalising households with assetsencouraging credit and labour marketsgenerally reducing market access barriers at the household and community levelsMost importantly, the authro states, available land could be more effectively used with less uncertainty, more asset endowments and less social discrimination (especially against women). Under such a scenario, and in strong contrast to findings from land scarce areas, the area farmed and hence farm output could rise significantly without resorting to intensive production techniques. ;T.

eldis:A42186;Agriculture in urban planning: generating livelihoods and food security;;"This report, by researchers working in urban agriculture (UA), examines concrete strategies to integrate city farming into the urban landscape. Drawing on original field work in cities across the rapidly urbanising global South, the book examines the contribution of UA and city farming to livelihoods and food security. The case studies covered by the authors, focus on the following aspects of urban agriculture:

    food production diversification for robust and secure food provision 
    the socio-economic and agronomic aspects of urban composting
    urban agriculture as a viable livelihood strategy 
    strategies for integrating city farming into urban landscapes 
    complex social-ecological networks of urban agriculture 
    public health aspects including the impact of pesticides, micro-biological risks, pollution and water contamination on food production and people. 

Ultimately the book calls on city farmers, politicians, environmentalists, and regulatory bodies to work together to improve the long term sustainability of urban farming as a major secure source of food and employment for urban populations. It also concludes that UA is now part of the debate on how to improve our cities - it is now a recognised field of research that has seen some rapid policy development in the past 15 years. This is because UA supports livelihoods and generates an economic value from land that would otherwise be idle or vacant. Its economic impact reaches far beyond farmers: it stimulates employment further along the chain of production for those who market, transport and sell produce, as well as for those who provide the tools and other means of production.

eldis:A73769;The eternal conflict: Land, peasants, and the military in Mexico;;"Land has always been an important site of struggle in Mexico, often bringing peasant movements and peasant communities into conflicts with the Mexican military. This CMI Insight focuses on the key conflict dimensions since the Mexican revolution (1910-1917) and up till today. The analysis highlights how the relationship between peasants and the army has changed from one of tentative mutual understanding in the post-revolution period to one in which the army increasingly acts as an oppressive agent; on behalf of powerful interests within its own ranks at first, and then on behalf of the Mexican state and private economic interests.

The analysis is based on a mathematical model, IDMC’s innovative Pastoralist Livelihoods and Displacement Simulator, a real-time tool that estimates displacement outcomes based on interactions between climate and human-induced factors. The study explores several scenarios to identify potential impacts of climate change and demographic trends and to test the effectiveness of measures to prevent and respond to droughts. Therefore, the primary intended audience for this paper are those in national and regional governments responsible for reducing and managing disaster risks – drought in particular – and for protecting the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs).

It argues that World Bank supported efforts at land and real estate reform have had too  narrow a technical focus, at the expense of institutional reform. The article finds that:some efforts emphasize  one set of reforms (such as mortgage finance) while ignoring others essential to those reforms (such as clear property rights and land registration)some efforts emphasize one sector (such as urban land) while ignoring its interaction with another (rural land conversion)to be successful, reforms need to be comprehensive in design, even if implementation is phased over timeReforms should include the following three elements:institutional reforms that better define property rights, reduce information asymmetry, and improve contract enforcementcapital market reforms that make mortgage finance available at reasonable rates, especially for the poormarket reforms that reduce or eliminate the main distortions in the prices of goods and services produced by land and real estate assets ;"A.

eldis:A40943;Land tenure and mining in Tanzania;;"This study focuses on mining related conflicts in Tanzania, a relatively new mining country. It argues that unclear land and mining rights, and conceptual differences in how land and mining rights are perceived, contribute to conflict in the country and to a feeling among both local people and human rights advocacy groups that the government has betrayed ordinary people.The study finds that there have been seven recorded conflicts related to mining companies in the country, six of them taking place over the last seven years. A majority of the large mines in the country have experienced conflicts with small scale miners and/or local communities. Of the “five big”, North Mara, Golden Pride, Bulyanhulu, Buhemba and Geita Gold Mine, three have been involved in serious conflicts.The author lists three main reasons which contribute to these conflicts:

    the system for granting concessions to mining firms is highly centralised, giving the commissioner for mining and the Minister responsible for mining immense power
    once a concession has been granted, lawful occupiers of land are not allowed to erect buildings or other structures in the area “without the consent of the registered holder of the Mineral Rights concerned” . This has led to bitterness and frustration, and poorer livelihoods in some communities
    there are constant rumors of alleged corruption among senior officials both in local authorities and in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals. Corruption is a major problem in the court system and probably in the land registration procedures as well

The author concludes that with a legacy of extremely ambiguous land tenure and a mining policy and mining laws that favor large scale mining over small scale mining and local communities in the name of national development, there seems to be no room for optimism when it comes to reducing mining related conflicts despite certain government initiatives to increase revenue from FDI and to reduce mining conflicts ";S.

eldis:A63657;Applying the concept of human security to research on the consequences of mining-induced displacement and resettlement;;The development of international mining projects is one of the most visible consequences of globalisation. But developments in the mining industry are the cause of about 10.3 percent of all displacements in the world. This means that more than a million people per year may be resettled as a result of resource extraction in various parts of the globe. Countries displaying the greatest growth rate of this phenomenon include India, China, Ghana, and many other African counties. The most burning issue is the establishment of large open-pit mines in developing countries, such as the Tarkwa Mine in Ghana, and the Tedi and Porgera Mines in Papua Island. The impact of mining on the dynamics of internal displacements remains a topic rarely analysed research. Authors are more concerned with displacements induced by the construction of large dams and the creation of national parks or by ongoing urbanisation processes. Instead of contributing to the well-being of local communities, the extraction of resources leads to a growing number of resettlements, environmental destruction, and a deterioration of the situation of marginalised groups. The consequences of the aforementioned problem do not diverge significantly from other categories of development-induced displacements such as oil-induced displacement, dam-induced displacement, or conservation-induced displacement. The analysis of internal displacement has become the focus of different fields of study. Sociology, social anthropology, human rights and development studies, and even philosophy are amongst disciplines particularly useful in the exploration of the consequences of development induced displacement. Research into this category of displacements, now under development for more than 40 years, has prompted the creation of specific theoretical concepts (i.e. the IRR model). The notion of human security also appears to be a useful scientific tool for more in-depth social analyses. Classification included in the Human Development Report published in 1994 distinguishes seven basic aspects of human security: economic security, food security, personal security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. Extraction of mineral resources leads to substantial threats to each of these aspects. An application of the aforementioned classifications to the research on the consequences of mining-induced displacement and resettlement helps to understand the broader context of problems encountered by the displacees. However, it should also be supplemented by two specific categories: gender security and cultural security. ;B.

eldis:A68541;Implications of community-based legal aid regulation on women’s land rights ;;"Improving women’s ability to securely access land is recognised as an effective means to increase gender equality and advance other key social and economic development goals. Despite progressive laws in many African countries, gender disparities commonly persist in women’s access and ownership of land.

Although legal empowerment of women can help to strengthen their claims to land, developing country governments commonly lack the capacity to offer legal services. Civil society is increasingly stepping in to fill the wide gap in legal service provision, with the aim of empowering marginalised groups and individuals to exercise their legal rights. Although legal aid has wide application, this brief looks on the consequences of regulating services provided at the community level to support women’s land rights, with a special focus on Tanzania.

The authors recommend areas for further investigation to inform future legal aid policy and regulations in Tanzania and beyond:


	
	evaluate the implications for geographic coverage and program quality by defining at least two distinct tiers of paralegals to provide legal services at different levels of decentralisation
	
	
	identify the appropriate educational criterion for each tier of paralegal that will identify individuals with the facility to access training materials and complete reporting requirements
	
	
	undertake additional research to establish distinct, paralegal training curricula that consider topic breadth versus relevance according to the services provided in each tier. Curricula for community paralegals should be based on analysis of the cost-effectiveness of initial training investments versus regular periodic training
	
	
	for additional insight on modalities to reduce paralegal attrition, conduct analysis on the cost effectiveness of paralegal compensation to assess the implications on programme quality and sustainability

eldis:A38048;Making the most of scarcity: accountability for better water management results in the Middle East and North Africa;;"Part of a series of development reports, this paper highlights the key challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa Region (MENA). In particular, it aims to show how water is integrated into the wider economic policies of the countries of the region and for that reason, it brings water issues to non-water specialists, addressing a multi-sectoral audience. It is argued that despite its diversity of landscapes and climates - from the snowy peaks of the Atlas mountains to the empty quarter of the Arabian peninsula - most of the region’s countries cannot meet current water demand. It is estimated that per capita water availability will fall by half by 2050, with serious consequences for the region’s already-stressed aquifers and natural hydrological systems. A series of technical and policy changes to the water sector in most MENA countries is needed if the countries are to accelerate their progress in the water policy arena and avoid the economic and social hardships that might otherwise occur. Potential solutions to the region’s water problems are well known but have often not been implemented because of constraints in the broader political economy. However, the authors assert, water need not be a constraint to economic development and social stability in MENA. Strong and diversified economies are themselves likely to give governments more political space for the reforms necessary to improve water management. Key actions that could be undertaken include:

    planning that integrates water quality and considers the entire water system including the promotion of demand management and irrigation, strengthening of government agencies, decentralising responsibility for delivering water services to financially autonomous utilities, and stronger enforcement of environmental regulations 
    developing measures that improve accountability for water planning and services tend to push the political economy toward more sustainable water management. These measures add information to the decision making process, give service providers incentives to improve performance, and reduce the chances that small groups will benefit disproportionately 
    evaluate the level and efficiency of public expenditure on water: Ministries of finance, economy, planning, trade, and agriculture need to know how much public money is spent on water and whether it is spent efficiently 
    define goals for public spending and cost recovery: governments, through the political process, determine the level of public spending on water that is appropriate for their circumstances. Governments can reduce public expenditure without reducing investment or services while recovering the costs from the beneficiaries.

eldis:A21914;Land registration in Maputo and Matola Cities, Mozambique;;Assesses the process of land registration in peri-urban areas of Mozambique and its outcomes for poor and marginalised groups. The research finds that there is little awareness of land registration processes on the part of low-income groups. The ‘individual’ registration process is slow and bureaucratic with high transaction costs and corrupt practices on the part of state institutions. Unlike the case of rural land, specific regulations governing the use of urban land are not yet in place. Some farmer associations have used community registration processes to secure their land rights but high levels of organisation and persistence are required to do so. Individual registration is beyond the means of low-income households and mainly serves high income, well connected groups and private companies. This situation is exacerbated by active informal land markets which are transforming peri-urban land use. There are real concerns that farmers, and low-income groups in general, may be losing access to land through registration processes which favour applicants who are well-connected and wealthy. Regulations governing urban land, the simplification and dissemination of registration procedures and improved governance are required for land registration to serve the majority.This report forms part of a series of seven papers based on a research programme entitled “Securing Land Rights in Africa: Can land registration serve the poor?” led by IIED. ;"D.

eldis:A8922;Sahelian Shepherds still struggling 25 years after the big drought;;Since the early 1970s, the position of pastoralists in West Africa's Sahel zone has become ever more precarious. Their plight is evidenced by rural-urban migration movements as well as the results of field surveys. The last major drought of 1983-1985 delivered a major blow to communities which derive most of their food and revenues from herding. In many rangeland areas there is civil unrest - even building to armed conflict in places - owing to mounting tensions between various pastoral groups. Daunted by the complexities of the issues and the difficulties of finding appropriate ways of intervening, more and more aid organisations are becoming less and less involved in pastoral development. ;Brigitte Thebaud;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"common property;land tenure;pastoralists";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A8922;http://www.id21.org/society/10aas.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fsociety%2F10aas.html;;;;"Sahel;Pastoralists;droughts;Africa;land tenure;Agriculture and food;Common Property Regimes;Grasslands Ecology;common property;Land tenure;Communal land"

The issue has been highlighted by the rise of Islamic militancy in the 1990s. Four aspects are examined: the meaning of Islam  for the people of Kashmir; the role of Islam in the formation of Kashmiri political identity; the secularization of this political identity; and the implications for the politics of fundamentalism. The paper concludes that despite the sharpening of  their Muslim identity, the logic of Kashmiri politics continues to be governed by the demand for autonomy - a question which remains largely non-communal.  The basic issue for the people still remains the right of the political community to determine its own political future. [author] ";R.

eldis:A20605;Key experiences of land reform in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa;;"Since 1994, the South African government has embarked on an ambitious land reform programme to redistribute and return land to previously disenfranchised communities. However, many black people lack the knowledge, skills and experience needed to manage their land. Furthermore, this paper finds that the way in which the government is implementing its land reform programme is constraining many of its beneficiaries from making agriculture a more important part of their livelihoods.The paper finds that there is a need for the government to invest more heavily in the ""pre-designation"" phase of the land reform process. Frequently many of the problems experienced by land reform groups in the ""post-designation phase"" can be traced to issues that were inadequately discussed before the land was transferred, and often the problems are more difficult to resolve after the pre-designation phase leading to inefficient resource use.The paper provides a number of conclusions and recommendations regarding changes to the pre- and post- designation parts of the process. For the pre-designation phase, these include:broadening the programme so that it is able to address a much wider range of issues than is currently occurring. These should not be restricted to technical agricultural matters; they must also embrace social, organisational and management issuesthe process should be made more inclusive, recognising that land reform beneficiaries have limited knowledge of agriculture and the risks and opportunities involvedthe sometimes hidden objective of preventing beneficiaries from settling permanently on their land must be addressed.A successful post-designation phase requires:ensuring that all beneficiaries, not just the better off, are able to gain access to their farms at a reasonable costinforming beneficiaries of their obligations to financial lenders and providing better access to the credit marketrevisiting the logic of transferring large technically complex farms to black people who have few of the relevant assets required to manage farms of this natureformulating a new model for land reform that allows the household, to start farming and providing a favourable institutional environment for expansion if they wish to make agriculture a more important part of their livelihoods.[adapted from author] ";A.

It argues that clearly defined land rights can help identify which actors are necessary to address drivers of deforestation and can determine shares in benefits from reduced deforestation. Local resource management may even improve forest outcomes. This brief aims to assist in the identification of rights relevant to REDD+ implementation and how those rights can be applied or supported to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of REDD+ activities. After introducing key concepts and legal and policy benchmarks, this brief outlines the technical elements of rights associated with REDD+, as well as options for and examples of asserting these rights. The final section lists a number of tools and resources available for additional information.

eldis:A25287;Open-range management and property rights in pastoral Africa: a case of spontaneous range enclosure in South Darfur, Sudan;;The enclosure of open rangeland and its allocation to individuals or groups is a component of many African livestock development projects. In project after project, however, pastoralists have declined to fence or reallocate ownership of their land according to project specifications. It would now appear that the promise of a more efficient system of livestock production and range management is not, in itself, sufficient to induce pastoralists to adopt a fenced system of ranching. The present paper therefore examines some of the economic, social and legal factors which may discourage or encourage pastoralists to enclose common rangeland. ;R. H.

eldis:A25286;Are stable agreements for sharing international river waters now possible?;;Proposed here is a new scheme for allocating international river water that accounts for the stochastic nature of water supply and the dynamic nature of its demand. The suggested scheme is expected to improve the efficiency of river basins' water allocation and the riparians' welfare.International river and lake basins constitute about 47 percent of the world's continental land area, a proportion that increases to about 60 percent in Africa, Asia, and South America. Because water is a scarce and increasingly valuable resource, disputes about water allocation within these basins often contribute to regional tensions and conflicts.Many principles of international law have been developed to allocate water within a water basin and to prevent or resolve international water disputes. Unfortunately, they rarely are easy to apply and often are contradictory. Sharing river water is particularly difficult because the effects are one-way, with upstream downstream supply disputes have been among the most common. Agreements about the allocation of river water often last only until the first drought, when reduced flow denies some their full shares.Kilgour and Dinar develop a simple formal model of water allocation among states within a river basin. They analyze the model in the context of variable flow rates, to project the behavior of riparian states during periods of above normal and below normal flow.Their objective: to understand when, where, and how much the economic interests of the states conflict, to develop principles guaranteeing efficient allocations of scarce water supplies, and to identify when stable (self enforcing) allocation agreements are possible. They also consider the possibility of using alternative sources of supply and of accommodating growth in demand.Satellite technology will soon dramatically improve the ability of riparian states to predict annual flow volumes. In addition, water basin authorities will have real-time data on riparians' water use. These developments will have important implications for the enforceability and the flexibility of river water allocation systems.This model shows how flexibility can be used to construct more durable systems for sharing water among riparian states. The new allocation methods proposed here should contribute to the better management of scarce water supplies, a crucial issue in an increasingly thirsty world.This paper a product of the Agricultural Policies Division, Agricultural and Natural Resources Department is part of a larger effort in the department to implement the World Bank Water Resources Management Policy.

eldis:A12735;Double standards: women's property rights violations in Kenya;;"This report recounts the experiences of 130 women from various regions, ethnic groups, religions, and social classes in Kenya who have had their property rights flouted because they are women.The report presents evidence that women are excluded from inheriting, evicted from their lands and homes by in-laws, stripped of their possessions, and forced to engage in risky sexual practices in order to keep their property. When they divorce or separate from their husbands, they are often expelled from their homes with only their clothing. Married women can seldom stop their husbands from selling family property. A woman’s access to property usually hinges on her relationship to a man. When the relationship ends, the woman stands a good chance of losing her home, land, livestock, household goods, money, vehicles, and other property. These violations have the intent and effect of perpetuating women’s dependence on men and undercutting their social and economic status.Recommendations to the Government of Kenya include adopting key provisions in the draft constitution:prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status;guaranteeing women’s right to equal treatment with men, including equal rights to inherit, have access to, and control property;prohibiting any law, custom, or tradition that undermines women’s dignity, welfare, interest, or status;guaranteeing every person the right to acquire and own property;ensuring that every person has the right to adequate housing; andrequiring parliament to enact laws protecting spousal rights to inherit land and laws protecting matrimonial property during and at the termination of marriage.Recommendations for donors and international organisations, include the following:The World Bank, donors, and UN agencies must work with the government of Kenya to ensure that development policies and programs are designed and implemented to promote women’s property rights and that concrete steps are taken to eliminate discriminatory laws and customs that undermine development efforts, specifically in the area of women’s equal property rights.The World Bank and the IMF should press the Kenyan government to abide by its commitments under its current PRSP and make the elimination of women’s property rights violations a central part of its next PRSP. Donors should increase financial and technical assistance to civil society organisations and government offices that combat women’s property rights abuses, including those that provide legal services; shelter, educational assistance, food, and medical care; credit; civic education programs on women’s property rights; and training of judicial officers on international and domestic laws relating to women’s equal property rights. In particular, donors should support organisations that provide information (e.g., through paralegals) to men, women, and traditional leaders in rural areas, and should provide funding for local language translations of laws and informational materials. Both the timeframe for funded projects and the amount of assistance should increase in light of the chronic and widespread nature of women’s property rights abuses.The UNDP, UNIFEM, UNAIDS and other international organizations should study the links between women’s property rights abuses, poverty, violence, and HIV/AIDS in Kenya.The special rapporteur on adequate housing appointed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights should continue and expand his reporting on women’s property rights violations, including by examining how discrimination in inheritance and division of family property impede the realisation of women’s right to adequate housing.Other recommendations are made to these bodies and for institutional and programmatic reforms and initiatives ";;;Human Rights Watch ;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"land;land tenure;property rights;property;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KEN;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12735;http://www.sarpn.org.za/documents/d0000333/P313_Kenya_Report.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sarpn.org.za%2Fdocuments%2Fd0000333%2FP313_Kenya_Report.pdf;;;;"Human rights;land;gender;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;Gender;property"

eldis:A70829;The status of agricultural water use, access, and productivity in the Limpopo Basin — opportunities for poverty alleviation ;;"The Limpopo River Basin is home to 14,000,000 people, at least half of whom live in rural areas. Over ten million South Africans live in the basin - nearly 25% of the national population. The remaining population live in Botswana - one million people, nearly 60% of the national population - Mozambique and Zimbabwe. While there are no major cities located on the river, several major urban areas in or adjacent to the basin impact water availability including quality.

Rainfall over much of the Limpopo is highly variable within and between years, so that farmers who rely on rain fed agriculture are vulnerable. Those with resources to invest in storage and water-saving technology are better able to withstand the chronic weather-related shocks. Yet few small-scale, resource-poor farmers have the resources to make the necessary investments, which many see as a risky venture.

The policy environment for management of natural resources in the four Basin countries has developed over the last 15 years, but further attention is needed in the following areas:


	strengthen Limpopo River Basin Commission (LIMCOM’s) capacity to plan and monitor water use and quality
	develop a secure framework of land tenure and water rights for rural populations to encourage investment and sustainability
	price and prioritise the use of water by small-holders to ensure their economic viability; and
	plan for water resources development with an eye toward the variation from the historical record of current and future precipitation scenarios

It is necessary to establish a coherent legal framework and to create the basis and conditions for a legalised gender culture, among both the beneficiaries of the law and the institutions. Likewise, it is essential to make fundamental changes in the cultural patterns and institutional mechanisms so as to anticipate and ensure the access of rural women to land, aiming for a sustained increase in agricultural productivity, ensuring a more efficient land use and contributing to food security. The modification of beliefs and customs is a long and complicated task. Therefore, it is necessary to invest resources and efforts to design ongoing, integral and long-term programmes that are geared to make community members, NGO personnel and institutional officials aware of the productive role played by women and the importance of their participation in rural development. At the same time, it is essential to dedicate human and financial resources to develop, promote and use all necessary means for the enforcement of programmes and development strategies that have a gender perspective. ;;;Sustainable Development Department, FAO SD Dimensions;eldis;01/01/1999;en;"land;land tenure;food security;land access;women";"Land & Gender;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";419;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A29250;ftp://ftp.fao.org/sd/AccessLand.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.fao.org%2Fsd%2FAccessLand.pdf;;;;"Food security;Gender roles in agriculture;Food security and gender;Gender;land tenure;Agriculture and food;agriculture gender;women;land;gender;Land tenure;land access;agrarian reforms;Gender roles within agriculture"
eldis:A102452;The ‘new’ African customary land tenure. Characteristic, features and policy implications of a new paradigm;;"Most of the land in sub-Saharan Africa is governed under various forms of customary tenure. Over the past three decades a quiet paradigm shift has been taking place transforming the way such landl is governed. Driven in part by adaptations to changing context but also accelerated by neo-liberal reforms, this shift has created a ‘new’ customary tenure in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper reviews some of the evidence and analyses the ways in which this neo-liberalisation of customary tenure has been transforming relations of production and how land is governed in sub-Saharan Africa. It identifies how core neo-liberalisation processes such as privatisation of rights, commoditisation, de-regulation; re-regulation and flanking have led to a formal reconfiguration of the way people relate to land. It presents a characterisation of the ‘new’-African customary tenure before sketching out evidence of outcomes associated with neo-liberalisation of customary tenure. The paper identifies five outcomes marking out the new customary tenure’s legacy. These are: creating new class dynamics (those with registered rights and those without), altered institutional power relations (extending statutory governance), local rank order change (replacing the traditional ‘big men’ of rural Africa with ‘new’ big shots), miniaturisation of smallholder farming and the growth in medium scale farms, growing inequality and potential social differentiation.

eldis:A27370;Livestock, land use and agricultural intensification in sub-Saharan Africa;;This paper focuses on extracts from a recent comparative analysis of livestock and land use surveys across a range of agro-climatic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa, based on information from systematic low level aerial reconnaissance and complementary ground studies in Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan and Tchad, between 1980 and 1993. Results indicate a highly significant relationship between livestock biomass and the intensity of land use, and suggest that cultivation and human habitation are the best predictors of livestock distribution.These findings are consistent with expectations of the Boserup hypothesis, and are indicative of the `autonomous intensification' of agricultural production associated with the growth of human population, through closer interaction between livestock and arable farmers. The autonomous control of tsetse and trypanosomiasis is a further consequence of the environmental impact of human population growth, which has favoured the southward dispersal and year-round presence of cattle in the Nigerian sub-humid zone. This in turn has created circumstances which have favoured the spread of animal traction and livestock fattening, which are themselves indicative of the intensification process. ;"D. Bourn

eldis:A38045;Land degradation assessment and prevention: selected case studies from the ESCWA region;;"This report looks at possible ways for policy-makers and decision-takers to combat and/or prevent land degradation in the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) region, both generally and specifically in the following countries: Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
The report begins by reviewing the extent, causes and impact of land degradation and examines the complexity of assessing land degradation programmes. It emphasises that successful programmes should entail certain criteria that would enable their stakeholders to judge easily their usefulness and to encourage their active participation in programme activities. The major criterion is predictability, which emphasises the issues of credibility, stability and formal entitlements; promoting collective action and a participatory approach; and ensuring that the programmes should be replicable and/or transferable to new environments while still being implemented successfully.   
The following case studies are used to illustrate these points:

    the Egyptian North-west Delta - traditionally a range land area but now facing coastal erosion and salinisation, mostly as a result of the increasing urbanisation process 
    two programmes/projects in Jordan, namely: the Al-Karak Agricultural Resource Management Project located in the south central highlands; and the Yarmouk River Basin project in an agricultural area highly affected by land degradation 
    the Syrian Arab Republic range land area of the Bishri Mountains, located in a semi-arid to arid Badia zone and intensely affected by land degradation due to inadequate land management practices
    the Ras Al-Khaimah Emirate in the north of the United Arab Emirates, which is mostly arid and affected by salinisation, moving sand dunes and water depletion 

The paper finds that there are a number of supportive elements which improve land degradation prevention. These include: 

    encouragement of including local knowledge in policy planning 
    use of strong well-planned, well-supported public institutions 
    coordination between different stakeholders

In conclusion, the paper notes that the ESCWA has developed a methodological framework to assess land degradation, which has so far been applied in Jordan and Lebanon. It is suggested that the framework could assist member countries in regularly identifying areas affected by land degradation, or “hot spots”, and areas responding well to measures of combating land degradation, or “bright spots”. A brief overview of the ESCWA framework is provided.

eldis:A63087;The Green Belt Initiative and Land Grabs in Malawi;;"FAC Policy Brief 55by Blessings Chinsinga and Michael Chasukwa
There is often a mismatch between the apparent benevolent intents and the practical manifestations of the large scale land deals. The empirical realities of the large-scale land deals call for critical scrutiny and interrogation of the underlying interests of the stakeholders involved to assess the extent to which they genuinely prioritize win-win scenarios. As the experiences of the Green Belt Initiative (GBI) in Malawi demonstrated, the smallholder farmer is almost always the loser.
This raises doubt as to whether the international initiatives such the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) voluntary guidelines on responsible governance of tenure of land and other natural resources; the World Bank’s principles for responsible agricultural investment; and the Africa Union’s (AU) framework and guidelines on land policy shall make any significant difference on the actual outcomes of the large-scale land deals across the continent.

eldis:A11335;National forest programme: forestland tenure systems in Tanzania;;"This paper begins by exploring the history of tenure in Tanzania's forests. It states that, while the government has retained ownership of forests centrally; locally, people have used forest resources without restriction. This has led to the over exploitation of many forest resources and a lack of sense of ownership and responsibility among forest communities.The author states that the government plans to transfer management rights for forests while retaining tenure centrally, but that there is confusion over how this division of rights can occur legally. He discusses a lack of knowledge of forest resources, which in turn means there cannot be titles for land to transfer. There is also a lack of knowledge among the public around the proposed new laws.The paper recommends three priorities:improved tenure through participatory land use planning, land surveys, valuation and titling of land and transfer to relevant partiesthe development of land information systems though remote sensing training and infrastructure developmentsensitization of the public thorough the media about their rights and responsibilities with regard to forests.

eldis:A34891;The Amazon’s vicious cycles: drought and fire in the greenhouse - ecological and climatic tipping points of the world’s largest tropical rainforest, and practical preventive measures;;"The Amazon forest greatly influences the global climate and may be coming under increasing threat due to climate change. This report explores the relationship between the Amazon, climate, and the changes in this relationship that are underway as a result of forest destruction and the release of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. The paper seeks to interpret the best information available to determine how close we are to a point of no return for a major forest “dieback” in the Amazon, and to identify some steps that might be taken to counter this process. The paper highlights the following on the link between the Amazon and the climate: 

    the Amazon forest complex is intimately connected to the world’s climate, acting as a giant consumer of heat, storing large amounts of carbon and discharging a large amounts of water into the ocean 
    climate change will probably reduce rainfall in eastern Amazonia by more than 20 per cent and increase the overall Amazon region’s temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsisus 
    current trends in agriculture and livestock expansion, fire, drought, and logging could clear or severely damage 55 per cent of the Amazon rainforest by the year 2030 
    extensive degradation of forest could be speeded through the synergistic influence of several vicious feedback loops that exist within and among the ecosystems and climate of the Amazon region 
    the ecological tipping point will be reached when fire-resistant native forests are degraded into fireprone brush through repeated forest damage from drought, logging, or fire 
    Amazon deforestation may accelerate in the future through two major trends: the growing world demand for soybeans, biofuel, and meat are increasing the profitability of agriculture and livestock production and the risk of accidental fire
    large-scale degradation of Amazon forests could speed the global climatic disruption, influencing the rainfall in far-flung places around the planet 

The report concludes that the conservation of the Amazon forest is necessary to stabalise the world’s climate and the stabalisation of the world’s climate is also necessary for Amazon forest conservation. The report highlights several opportunities to reverse current trends: 

    the growing demand for higher environmental performance that is evident among the buyers and financiers of agricultural commodities could move the Amazon agro-industrial and livestock sectors towards greater compliance with the law and the adoption of best agricultural practices 
    forest recovery and tree crop establishment on degraded lands can restore transpiration and buffer regional climate against extreme climate events 
    sustainable timber management involving “reduced impact” logging techniques represents an important economic alternative to deforestation-dependent farming and ranching
    merely implementing existing land-use policies and programmes within the Brazilian Amazon and extending these policies and programmes to other Amazon countries could reduce deforestation by half.

eldis:A11330;HIV/AIDS and its impacts on land tenure and livelihoods in Lesotho: comments on Lesotho country study;;"This paper addresses the amelioration of the impact of AIDS on land tenure and livelihoods. The author argues that, in Lesotho,  land policy development should be informed by the status of community support and welfare for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. He offers three main policy recommendations as follows:
 Land administrators should be fully informed about the epidemic and various legislations that govern the rights of the affected households. This will help to ensure uniform implementation of measures to support affected households. The importance of land to communities calls for concerted efforts to make the public aware of current Land Acts and proposed changes to land policy. Particular attention should be paid to provisions likely to affect households affected by HIV/AIDS. Provisions likely to have negative impacts should be removed or reformulated and those likely to have positive impacts should be strengthened. This should include a review of the likely impacts of the present trend towards concentration and commercialisation of land holding and agriculture on HIV/AIDS affected households and suitable action to secure their livelihoods. Mechanisms already being used by communities to make land policies suit their present circumstances should be examined and where possible adopted in current or proposed land policy and legislation. This should include mechanisms to ensure that sharecropping can continue to support the food security of affected households. [Adapted from author] ";A.

Through an examination of contests over land, forest and water resources, the paper looks at the emerging power dynamics between new elected authorities at municipal and council level and traditional authorities (chiefs and headmen), and raises questions about the efficacy and long term sustainability of decentralisation reforms as currently conceived.Main conclusions include:the ongoing process of decentralisation, coupled with major policy developments in land and water sectors, is altering the mechanisms through which rural people gain access to key assets and servicesthe difficulty of establishing a new system of local elected local government in the rural areas has been greatly exacerbated by the presence of tribal authorities, which continue to operate in much the same way as they did in the pre democratic eraboth traditional leaders and elected local representatives are frustrated at the lack of clarity regarding the functions of their respective institutions and the lack of guidance being provided by national governmentlocal level government decision making is highly dependent on higher level bodiesCouncillors can create a valuable and direct link between local government and the communities they servethe links between the current decentralisation process, the management of natural resources and the livelihoods of the rural poor are extremely complex and often unclear. the ability of people directly affected by such development to positively influence the process appears to be  limitedthe failure by the state to deal decisively with the question of traditional leaders and tribal authorities creates an ongoing dilemma for these institutionsdespite the changing political landscape, and the loss of certain powers and privileges, it is likely that the system of village governance, based on village assemblies, and currently dominated by traditional leaders and tribal authorities, will survive in one form or another for a long time to come[Adapted from author] ;"Z.

eldis:A29264;Paper tiger, hidden dragons: the responsibility of international financial institutions for Indonesian forest destruction, social conflict and the financial crisis of Asia Pulp & Paper;;This report documents the environmental and social impacts of Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), assesses the role of international financial institutions in fuelling APP’s unsustainable and damaging operations and examines the link between this unsustainable practice and APP's financial crisis.Financial institutions should acknowledge that it is far more than the financial failure of APP that proves that they seriously underestimated the risk in financing the company. Indeed international financial institutions have failed to sufficiently recognise and act upon a number of risks that are inherent in any investment in the Indonesian pulp and paper industry. These risks are identified as follows:unsustainable supply of raw materialsillegal loggingdistorted global paper marketpoor financial regulationhidden debt burdendebt-driven expansionsocial conflictAPP & covert marketingAs a result of their inadequate investigation and understanding of the Indonesian pulp and paper industry, combined with their substantial investment in those companies over a number of years, financial institutions must accept their share of the responsibility for the crisis facing APP. Lessons in risk learned from the APP crisis should be applied by financial institutions to all their pulp and paper investments. Without ensuring that their investments are both socially and environmentally sustainable, their investments will not be economically sustainable.Recommendations for financial institutions:to help minimise risk and ensure the sustainability of APP and the pulp and paper industry both in Indonesia and other parts of the world, financial institutions are urged to undertake the following recommendations:financial institutions should adopt and enforce more effective due diligence practices to fully assess the financial risks involved with the pulp and paper sector and to ensure that they are not providing funds for illegal or unsustainable practicesfinancial institutions should not provide funds for any new pulp and paper processing capacity in Indonesia and Malaysia for the forseeable future. This should include halting investment in Borneo Pulp and Paper in Sarawak (Malaysia) and two other proposed pulp and paper plants in Kalakaban in Sabah (Malaysia) and at Sungai Danau in Kotabaru, South Kalimantan (Indonesia)financial institutions supporting APP and its subsidiaries should take immediate action to ensure that the fibre supply to APP’s pulp mills comes from legal and sustainable sources and does not involve the destruction of any more rainforest. Financial institutions should agree upon a strategy for achieving this with APP and make the group’s raw material supply chain open to independent verification. To achieve this, financial institutions should take steps to ensure that APP’s processing capacity is reduced and / or to ensure that timber from natural forests is replaced with sustainably harvested pulpwood from independently certified sources. Reducing capacity and ensuring supplies are legal may have the benefit of helping raise global paper pricesfinancial institutions should ensure that they do not invest in pulp and paper projects that are likely to generate social conflict. In the case of APP, financial institutions should work with the group to resolve the conflict between its plantation company and the Sakai people in a manner that is equitable for the affected communitiesto ensure the long term survival of the pulp and paper industry, financial institutions should support projects that utilise agricultural waste products and recycled materials as a more sustainable raw material replacement for timber. More sustainable sources of supply often carry lower risk ;"E. Matthew

eldis:A60895;Forest management and climate change: a literature review;;"This literature review assesses current and potential future changes occurring within the forestry sector. It identifies challenges posed to forests and analyses the relationship between forests and climate change. While it is relatively safe to assume that temperature increase is a threat to the survival of many ecosystems other challenges, such as extreme weather and precipitation levels, are harder to predict. Other challenges identified include the management of climate change related human migration and maintaining an equitable balance between adapting to new market conditions and retaining ecological integrity. The review explores forest management options for mitigation and adaptation strategies with an emphasis on monitoring, capacity building, market influences and risk reduction. The review also identifies gaps in enabling conditions that require further research and action, including knowledge of potential climate change impacts, the capacity of forest managers to adapt, technology and the institutional environment. 
Mitigation strategies highlighted in the review include: 

    clearer definitions of land, forest and carbon rights
    raising awareness of climate change amongst forest managers 
    documentation and sharing of best practice and lessons learned 
    establishment of stakeholder platforms to ensure transparency and equity. 

The document includes the following suggestions for strengthening adaptation measures. 

    More research is required in monitoring systems, the adaptability and flexibility of different species to climate change, optimum management cycles, impact modelling and incentive mechanisms.
    Training in sustainable forest management should be improved. 
    Improvements are needed in the institutional framework to clarify rights, ensure greater equity, provide a multi-sectoral approach, improve local governance and provide financial and technical assistance (particularly for carbon markets).

eldis:A75213;Land rental market activity in agrarian reform areas: evidence from the Philippines;;"Using data from 3,120 farm households surveyed in 2000 and 2006, the paper tests for factors that affect the degree and extent of households’ participation in the rural land rental market. The survey period coincided with the full implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) which imposes restriction on the conveyance and transfer (including rental) of all lands awarded under the program.

Econometric results show that the rural land rental market is not functioning efficiently. Transaction costs in land leasing are significant resulting in high proportion of nonparticipants and incomplete adjustment toward desired cultivated area for households that participate in the market. Moreover, the poor and landless have limited access to the land rental market since participation in the market is not determined by agricultural ability but is strongly influenced by endowment of land and access to formal credit. While households with less land tend to rent-in more land, the demand for land increases for household owning land more than five hectares.

On the other hand, the wealth bias of rural credit market is creating more barriers for the poor to access land. The poor has been able to participate in the rental market through share tenancy arrangements but dependence on informal credit markets constrains them to operate desired cultivated area. The twin effects of inefficient land rental market and credit market imperfections can offset labor advantages of family farms and cause farms to operate below optimal level. The need to achieve an efficient farm size is critical for rural development and should be viewed separately from land ownership. In particular, the land rental market plays a critical role in access to land by the poor and in households’ adjustment to an optimal farm size. It would thus be desirable for the government to improve the regulatory framework for the land rental market to operate efficiently.

eldis:A20356;Contracting out of human rights: the Chad–Cameroon pipeline project;;Will an oil pipeline investment agreement between the governments of Chad and Cameroon and a consortium led by ExxonMobil, including Chevron and Petronas pose a serious threat to human rights in Chad and Cameroon? A report by Amnesty International examines possible roots of human rights abuses that might occur in the context of this foreign direct investment.The report argues that certain aspects of the agreement, primarily due to a lack of clarity,  may signal a disregard for the international framework set up to protect human rights and could:hold back the governments of Chad and Cameroon, which have poor track records on human rights, from taking steps to improve the human rights protection of those affected by the pipeline projectmake it more difficult to hold the consortium to account for abuses of human rights that result from its activitiesencourage the governments of Chad and Cameroon to ignore their human rights obligations, by claiming that the agreements prevent them from taking measures that would destabilise the financial equilibrium of the project, even if such measures are intended to respect, protect and fulfil human rightsbe interpreted to allow the oil companies to extract and transport oil and operate the pipeline project free from full accountability under domestic laws against human rights abuses.The report calls on governments, international financial institutions and companies involved in the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project to revise the project agreements to include an explicit guarantee that nothing in the agreements can be used to undermine either the human rights obligations of the states or the human rights responsibilities of the companies. In particular Amnesty International is urging that the investment agreements:allow the regulation of actions of the companies involved, to ensure that they do not abuse human rightsremove obstacles to progressive realisation of human rightsavoid placing a price tag on human rightsgive precedence to international human rights law over industry standardsrespect the right to an effective remedyensure the right to equalityprotect labour rights and the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. ;;;Amnesty International ;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;"TCD;202;CMR";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A20356;http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/POL34/012/2005/en/76f5b921-d4bf-11dd-8a23-d58a49c0d652/pol340122005en.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amnesty.org%2Fen%2Flibrary%2Fasset%2FPOL34%2F012%2F2005%2Fen%2F76f5b921-d4bf-11dd-8a23-d58a49c0d652%2Fpol340122005en.pdf;;;;"Human rights;human rights abuse;pipeline;Exxon;International capital flows;Extractive industries;investment agreement;International capital flows FDI;Extractive industries oil;Finance policy;corporate social responsibility;oil;Petronas;Chevron;Foreign Direct Investment;Corporate Social Responsibility;Business and human rights;CSR"
eldis:A41706;Illegal logging: current issues and opportunities for SIDA/SENSA engagement in Southeast Asia;;"This report provides an overview of the issues, root causes, and driving forces behind the crimes related to illegal logging. The report includes a comprehensive review of existing initiatives to address the challenges of illegal logging in Southeast Asia. The results are derived mainly from a literature review of various publications, websites, and project documents, but also from personal communication through interviews with people working on the issues of illegal logging in the region.
The paper outlines illegal practices in the forest sector, including logging, timber smuggling, tax avoidance, illegal timber processing. Illegal logging can be seen as a symptom of wider problems. In order to combat illegal logging, it is important not only to target the symptom itself, but also to understand and address the underlying causes. The causes are complex and often lie outside the forestry sector.Some of the key drivers and trends behind illegal logging in Asia include:

    export-driven growth and expanding demand for cheap forest products
    increasing trade
    land conversation

However, not all trends in the region are negative. Some positive trends are pushing for increased attention to be paid to the issues of illegal logging. These include:

    awareness of and demand for legal wood
    increased community management of forests
    mechanisms in response to climate change

eldis:A28250;Displacement, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Reparation and Development [as a result of dams];;"Reviews recent practices relating to displacement, resettlement, rehabilitation and development of people negatively affected by the construction of dams, in order to locate  the global experiences in dam induced displacement and understand the socio-political context of displacement and resettlement. Further, the assessment focuses on how legal and regulatory instruments facilitating displacement and involuntary resettlement have performed in safeguarding the rights of affected people. This review then identifies the essential principles of good practices that would constitute a 'successful', displacement, resettlement, rehabilitation and development program. A framework to facilitate a process of negotiation between State and the displaced people and legal instruments and remedial action necessary to ensure accountability on part of governments and facilitating agencies for accomplishing negotiated resettlement goals are presented.Key findings include:Generally, displacement as a result of acquisition is legally sanctioned while there is no legal framework that governs the process of displacement itself: the land acquisition law protects the sanctity of what causes displacement (i.e., the dam) but not the displaced. In the absence of legal safeguards to ensure accountability on the part of the State, resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) entitlements promised often by executive order have rarely been implemented in its entirety covering all affected peopleFor the dams funded by multilateral development institutions the nature and extent of compliance of 'mutually' agreed criteria and guidelines have been mixed. Frequently, monitoring missions were either inconsistent in their appraisal of compliance standards or accepted undue delays and deviationsA theme common in almost all countries is that funds for R&R program were inadequateThe concept of programming resettlement as development programme mode is gaining currency though practice is limited. ‘Good practices’ in this respect are those that (a) focus on means of livelihood rather than on assets; (b) assume an inclusive relationship between people and assets; and (c) admit of a negotiated definition of ‘just’ compensation. The record indicates that in those cases in which compensation packages were negotiated with PAPs and other stakeholders, the process has resulted in better outcomes for the resettlement process as a whole. Even when, for whatever reason, the negotiated form of compensation proves not to be the most appropriate or effective option, PAPs tend to feel more satisfied, as a result of the negotiation process, as attested by the Zimapan resettlement program in Mexico.There is an inverse relationship between scale of displacement and extent of achieving successful resettlement outcomes even in countries with best policy, institutional capacity and political commitment to do proper resettlement. There are a few good examples of minimising displacementGenerally, participation of the affected people has been superficial or treated as unimportant by those responsible for the project. Real participation implies the capacity to influence or even modify decisions. Good practices from Brazil, Canada and other countries offer significant learning value for the WCD have emerged from the case studies and submission to the WCDIn several countries, the indigenous and tribal peoples displaced by large dams seem to have experienced higher level of landlessness, unemployment, indebtedness and hunger. The studies have also documented adverse impact of displacement on women and children. Only situations where loss of land and access to natural resources were replaced with sustainable resources women had opportunities to recover their social and economic worth and respect.Some of the specific dominant themes emerging from displacement literature are:The displaced and affected people rarely received complete and authentic information on the dam project, nature and extent of displacement and other negative impacts, and R&R provisionsAbsence of baseline surveys, inability to determine number of people displaced and affected. The displaced and affected people normally did not have any role in generation of baseline information, development of resettlement plans or its implementation and monitoring. Traumatic forced and delayed relocation; denial of development opportunity for years, and often decades due to long displacement processProblems (related to infrastructure, relationship with host communities, etc.) in resettlement sites Loss of livelihood of people living in downstream not properly assessed and compensated.Concludes that a ‘successful’ resettlement with development is a fundamental commitment and responsibility of the State. No development project can result in complete alienation of the rights, customary and legal, of people through payment of a one-time compensation or facilitated relocation. On the contrary the process must result in the creation of new rights that will render people direct beneficiaries of the development project. Just as displacement is not an inevitable consequence of infrastructure development resettlement need not necessarily result in impoverishment. Central to positive resettlement and rehabilitation will be the empowering of people particularly the economically and socially marginalised as a result of both the process and outcomes of resettlement with development.

eldis:A25359;The relationship between farm size and efficiency in South African  agriculture;;Commercial farms in South Africa could become significantly more efficient if they became smaller. The government could encourage that trend by removing policies and distortions that favor large over small farms.Drawing on international evidence, van Zyl, Binswanger, and Thirtle discuss the sources of economies of scale. Using representative farm level survey data for South Africa's six major grain producing areas and one irrigation area for the period 1975  90, they:Describe the structure of South African agriculture, detailing the distribution of farm sizes and results from previous studies of farm size efficiency. Analyze the evidence on scale efficiency in the former homelands. Analyze the relationship between farm size and efficiency in commercial farming and discuss how policy affects that relationship.Clearly policy has a crucial impact on the relationship between farm size and efficiency. They find that:Farms in the former homelands seem to be scale inefficient, which is unsurprising, given the historical lack of access to support services and infrastructure, policies that discriminate against farmers in the homelands, and the extremely fragmented and limited land use rights of farmers there. There is an inverse relationship between farm size and efficiency in the commercial farming areas for the range of farms analyzed, regardless what method is used. This inverse relationship seems to become stronger and more accentuated as policy distortions --- which tend to favor large farms over small ones --- are removed. Large farms tend to use more capital intensive methods of production, while smaller farms are more labor intensive. And managerial ability seems to be better on larger farms.There is an inverse relationship between farm size and efficiency in South African agriculture despite South Africa's history of policies favoring relatively large mechanized farms. Clearly, efficiency gains could be significant if commercial farms became smaller. To encourage that trend, policies and distortions that favor large farms over small should be removed.This paper --- a product of the Office of the Director, Agriculture and Natural Resources Department --- is part of a larger effort in the department to design appropriate strategies for land reform.

eldis:A25358;Testing the induced innovation hypothesis in South African agriculture : an  error correction approach;;Apparently factor prices do matter in agricultural production and in the selection of production technology. And in South Africa, more attention should be focused on the technological needs of small scale farmers. Current policies sustain the bias toward labour saving technical change, hardly appropriate for a labor surplus economy in which small farmers in the former homelands face a chronic scarcity of land.Thirtle, Townsend, and van Zyl investigate whether factor prices matter in agricultural production and in the selection of production technology.Each stage of the analysis corroborates the inducement hypothesis, which implies that factor prices do matter in agricultural production and in the selection of production technology.The empirical results also suggest that observed rates and biases of technological change are influenced by average farm size, by spending on research and extension, and by favorable tax and interest rate policies.In South Africa, the authors contend, more attention should be focused on the technological needs of small scale farmers. The lobbying power of the large commercial farmers, combined with policies followed under apartheid, must have influenced the allocation of research and development funds between labor and land saving technical change. This will have distorted the technological bias toward labour saving technical change, which is hardly appropriate for a labor surplus economy in which small farmers in the former homelands face a chronic scarcity of land.These results show that factor prices do matter in agricultural production and the selection of production technology. And there seems to be merit to the World Bank's usual policy prescription --- structural adjustment and market liberalization --- for economies in which prices are controlled and distorted.They investigate the role of factor prices by applying cointegration techniques to a model of induced innovation based on the two stage constant elasticity of substitution production function. This approach results in direct tests of the inducement hypothesis, which are applied to data for South African agriculture for the period 1947  92. They check the time series properties of the variables, establish cointegration, and construct an error correction model (ECM) that allows factor substitution to be separated from technological change. Finally, they subject the ECM formulation to tests of causality, which show that the factor price ratios induce the factor saving biases of technological change.This paper --- a product of the Office of the Director, Agriculture and Natural Resources Department --- is part of a larger effort in the department to design appropriate agricultural policies.

eldis:A14914;Report of the FAO/OXFAM GB workshop on women's land rights in Southern and Eastern Africa;;This document reports on a workshop held in South Africa in June 2003 to address continuing insecurity of women's land rights. It brought together a broad group of participants covering NGO, grassroots, government, UN agency staff, researchers, activists,  lawyers, and women living with HIV/AIDS. Some of the issues that emerged in the workshop were:ways in which women could mobilise in defence of their rights varied in relation to their social status, family networks, access to state services and attitudes of state officialsa low level of knowledge about rights and the lack of resources to pursue them often narrow women’s possibilities of accessing their rights to land and housing'formal' property rights administration systems are generally neither transparent nor accessible to slum dwellers and the poor in general because of their high costthere is a need to provide training and sensitisation in gender and human rights to the formal justice structures to create awareness and change perceptions and to improve the many flaws in traditional justice delivery structuresa human rights approach to housing and land rights is more effective and less contradictory than an approach which advocates land rights for women on the basis of the high percentage of work they do both within the household and on the landNGOs at grassroots level play an important role in helping women exercise their rights. However, their efforts are hampered by donor short-term commitment and externally-driven agendasinternational organisations ought to build on existing experiences rather than try to build things themselves.[adapted from author] ;;;Southern African Regional Poverty Network ;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"land;advocacy;land tenure;land rights;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KEN;202;BWA;MOZ;ZAF;UGA;ETH;MWI";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14914;http://www.sarpn.org.za/documents/d0000583/P537_WLR_SandE-Africa.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sarpn.org.za%2Fdocuments%2Fd0000583%2FP537_WLR_SandE-Africa.pdf;;;;"Gender;advocacy;land tenure;Agriculture and food;Ethiopia;land rights;pastoralism;Land tenure;Malawi;women's land rights"
eldis:A28257;Land tenure, investment, and agricultural production in Nicaragua;;While there is a consensus in Nicaragua that the security of property rights is a fundamental constraint to the long run development of the agricultural sector, there has been little empirical analysis to date of the relationship between land rights and rural economic activity.Using household level data collected between December, 1997– April, 1998 within the regions of Leon and Chinandega (known administratively as Region II), this paper investigates the relationship between rural land rights and agricultural credit, investment, and rural incomes (on farm and off farm).Results indicate total credit received was significantly and negatively related to female-headed households and households with no documented form of land rights. While there is no significant relationship in the data between investment (defined as either total investment or just agricultural investment) and land rights and household characteristics, tenure status is significantly related to the number of trees on the property (a form of long-term land investment).Results indicate that off-farm income is significantly and positively related to the education level of household heads and the lack of any form of documented land rights. Farm income, defined for the purposes of this study as gross agricultural revenues, is shown to be increasing in the degree of tenure security, the education of the household head, farm size, and individual operation, and decreasing in the years since acquiring the property.In sum, these results indicate that improved clarity and enforcement of rural property structures can have a positive impact on rural credit access and farm profitability.[author] ;"J.

eldis:A14916;Land theme paper (sustainable livelihoods);;"This paper examines the challenges of institutional, organisational and policy reform around land in Southern Africa. It analyses the land situation in South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and identifies key issues for further research in each of these countries.
Findings include:

    there is a convergence of policy in key areas in the region, determining the current approach to land and land reform, which can be attributed to its growing exposure to the forces of globalisation, and with it the influence of the international neo-liberal orthodoxy
    this policy convergence is characterised by the privatisation of resources, the retreat by the state from key areas of the economy, the pursuit of foreign direct investment and sweeping deregulation of markets
    the drive to reorient economies in the region in line with the new global imperatives is promoted by donor governments and international financial institutions and has been embraced enthusiastically by the ruling parties in Mozambique and South Africa
    this discourse also underpins much of current debate in Zimbabwe, where the government is struggling to reconcile its antipathy to structural adjustment with the demands of foreign donors and the pending collapse of key sectors of the economy
    in its unalloyed form, the discourse of globalisation resolves the equity-efficiency dichotomy entirely in favour of efficiency and a distinct concept of livelihoods cannot be sustained
    a variation on the neo-liberal position promoted wider distribution of land on the basis that this will result in efficiency gains, thus leading to enhanced livelihood opportunities for the rural poor, but this enjoys little support outside academic circles
    within the emerging orthodoxy, a number of older discourses, which do not directly challenge the dominant position, live on
    the main challenge to the neo-liberal orthodoxy comes from a range of populist discourse, mainly associated with NGOs and church groups with varying degree of support from peasant movements
    with a few notable exceptions, popular participation has not been a major feature of land policy in the region in recent years, in terms of either policy formulation or implementation

eldis:A25353;The development of industrial pensions in the United States during the  twentieth century;;"A survey of the development of pensions in the United States, addressing such issues as what employees want from pensions, what incentives the employer has to create pensions, and what desirable effects industrial pensions have on the economy.Pensions are retirement insurance: They offer protection in case you live long enough to quit collecting a paycheck and can stop working. In the United States, pensions are provided by both public and private sectors. Private sector pension funds are the largest formal financial institution for lifecycle saving, with assets of trillions of dollars.Pensions developed when more traditional forms of lifecycle saving became more difficult to carry out, job tenure increased, and there was a movement away from the spot labor market. Employers wanted to create a stable, experienced work force that was reluctant to leave --- that is, a stock of firm specific human capital. Thus they had an incentive to create a deferred wage. And workers wanted retirement insurance that was secure. As developing countries begin to employ an older work force with longer job tenure, the demand for defined benefit pensions will rise.Which institution can best provide pensions: the employer, a financial intermediary, or the state? If markets fluctuate because of financial instability, workers will prefer defined benefit plans, and they will want them to be provided by the institution in which they have the most faith.Funding is important in the long run. Sound accounting practices would dictate that the cumulative reserves match pension liabilities as they accumulate. The regular contribution to these funds would be the deferred part of the wage. But historically, in the United States, pensions were funded only when profits were high or tax incentives or regulation dictated.Developing countries will need a sound corporate tax structure and must be willing to forgo some immediate tax revenue, to create a large pension savings fund.This paper --- a joint product of the Finance and Private Sector Development Division, Policy Research Department, and the Financial Sector Development Department --- was presented at a Bank seminar, ""Financial History: Lessons of the Past for Reformers of the Present,"" and is a chapter in a forthcoming volume, Reforming Finance: Some Lessons from History, edited by Gerard Caprio, Jr. and Dimitri Vittas.

eldis:A69016;Land use land cover change in the fringe of eThekwini Municipality: Implications for urban green spaces using remote sensing;;"This study sought to determine a 22-year past and future land use and land cover trend and its implication on green spaces in an eThekwini Municipal Area’s peripheral settlement. Results show a consistent pattern of decline in land use and land cover types associated with green spaces and an increase in impervious surfaces. The study is taken to confirm recent urban bio-physical transformation and anticipated increased pressure on peripheral urban green spaces in eThekwini Municipality. These changes can be attributed to natural urban growth and government led efforts like the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Findings in the study highlight the challenges faced by eThekwini Municipality, and indeed other South Africa’s urban areas in maintaining urban green spaces and mitigating related implications like those associated with climate change. This study is taken to further demonstrate the value of multi-temporal remotely sensed datasets in planning, optimization and sustainable management of urban landscapes.

eldis:A75601;Brazil: no easy miracle increasing transparency and accountability in the extractive industries;;"Brazil’s consolidation as an emerging economy is not easily attributed to any political or economic miracle. Brazil has consciously adapted a large part of its commercial and financial strategy to changes in the global arena. As worldwide demand has grown for raw materials—especially for single-crop agriculture, oil and minerals—Brazil’s growing economy has become increasingly dependent on the export of commodities.

Mining and oil activities in Brazil are growing fast. Brazil is currently a major global player in the extractive industries, especially through Vale in mining and Petrobras in oil and gas. Rapid changes at the national level have not been accompanied by equally rapid policy developments to ensure access to public information, which would permit greater control over common resources and goods by the active global citizenry. New legislation for the mining and oil industries is being passed with little or no debate by Brazilian society.

As major companies such as Vale and Petrobras have strengthened Brazil’s position as one of the world’s leading oil and mineral exporters, there has been no forum for debate on the implications of this trend for health, environment, marine flora and fauna, employment, or impacts on life in affected communities. A debate on transparency and accountability is urgently needed in Brazil, together with the ability to imagine a different society, one that avoids the exclusion, marginalization and destruction of communities and nature.

Fortunately, there is an enormous network of social and political actors working on the issue: universities, NGOs, social movements and even agencies and institutes of government ministries. There is also a clear geographic focus for advocacy work: because Rio de Janeiro State and certain Amazonian states (Pará) have the largest volumes of oil and gas extraction, together they form a strategic area for work on extractive industries in Brazil. A strategy to increase transparency and accountability in Brazil’s extractive sector could begin with Petrobras and an international consortium of NGOs implementing the ISO 26000 international standard for social responsibility. This standard, together with the Social Balance Sheet developed by the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analyses, could serve as the foundation for a binding law for the entire extractive industry.

Brazil would benefit from the creation of a multi-stakeholder group that included civil society and corporations that could produce national reports on the extractive industries and social responsibility. Civil society initiatives should be strengthened, especially by forming common networks that can contribute to the creation of an overall strategic vision, both within Brazil and internationally—especially in connection with Africa and Latin America.

It would be useful to promote a political entity through which the Brazilian government could formulate transparency and accountability policies, creating mandatory reports on all overseas payments and projects by companies whose stock is listed on the stock exchange. And since the legislative debate is currently focused on the collection of revenue, it would be strategic to introduce transparency and accountability criteria into the debate on the mining code and royalties from oil extraction.

eldis:A65160;Agrarian Labour Relations in Zimbabwe after Over a Decade of Land and Agrarian Reform;;"Walter ChambatiApril 2013
This paper begins highlights some key features that shape agrarian labour relations in Zimbabwe, illustrated through the setting of Goromonzi district. The new agrarian structure that forms the basis of the reconfigured agricultural production systems and labour relations is then analysed. This allows for the examination of the labour mobilisation patterns among the different classes of producers resulting from agrarian restructuring. The assessment of the material conditions that farm labourers derive from selling labour in various ways and their responses to the challenges they face precede the conclusions.
The new agrarian labour relations are explored using empirical research in Goromonzi district. Research undertaken by the African Institute for Agrarian Studies (AIAS) since 2002, including a baseline survey in 2006 of 695 landholders and 173 farm workers in Goromonzi is used to illustrate the outcomes prior to economic stabilisation in 2009.iii The analysis draws from the results of the survey reported in Moyo et al. (2009) and the data referenced as AIAS (2007). Qualitative surveys in Goromonzi in 2012 are used to trace the dynamic changes to agrarian labour relations as further land redistribution occurred and the macro-economic context and agrarian policies shifted. Data was collected through interviews and observations from farm labourers, landholders, farm compounds, traditional authorities and state officials.

eldis:A19657;Corporate Social Responsibility in mining in Southern Africa: fair accountability or just greenwash?;;Based on case studies of mining in South Africa and Zambia, this article assesses CSR practices with accountability and fairness as key criteria.Main findings and conclusions of the report are:CSR is an increasingly prominent discourse also in southern Africa, particularly among mining companies due to mining’s potentially significant negative social and environmental impacts as well as inherent finiteness of the resource bodyaccountability - the emphasis on identifying and mitigating the impacts of core business practices - and fairness - the emphasis on helping the most vulnerable - are key criteria for any assessment of CSR policies and practicesthere are still important gaps between mining companies’ CSR activities, on the one hand, and accountability and fairness, on the otherin contrast to the business case argument for CSR, critical perspectives argue that CSR is primarily about greenwash, or the projection of a caring image without significant change to socially or environmentally harmful business practicesin South Africa, core business practices framed by the country’s colonial and apartheid history have been relatively resistant to socially motivated change, despite the increasing prominence of CSR policies and reportson the Zambian Copperbelt, CSR activities have played primarily an ameliorative role in the context of significant social disruption and uncertainty in the wake of privatisation.The article concludes that companies’ CSR-related claims, and particularly the reference to a business case for voluntary CSR, need to be treated with caution. However, CSR is not necessarily only greenwash. There are exceptions to the general trends considered above, and furthermore many of the CSR-related activities mentioned do represent important development contributions. ;"R. Hamann

eldis:A27679;Microdeterminants of Consumption, Poverty, Growth, and Inequality in Bangladesh;;What are the gains from a better education, more land ownership, or a different occupation in Bangladesh? Do the gains differ in urban and rural areas? Have they remained stable over time? Do household size, family structure, and gender affect well-being? Do consumption, poverty, and inequality depend more on characteristics of households or on the areas in which those households are located?Using household data from five successive national surveys, Wodon analyzes the microdeterminants of (and changes in) consumption, poverty, growth, and inequality in Bangladesh from 1983 to 1996. Education, demographics, land ownership, occupation, and geographic location all affect consumption and poverty. The gains in per capita consumption associated with many of these household characteristics tend to be stable over time. Returns to demographics (variables in household size) have the greatest impact on growth, perhaps because of improving employment opportunities for women. Education (in urban areas) and land (in rural areas) contribute most to measures of between-group inequality. Location takes second place, in both urban and rural areas. Wodon introduces the concept of conditional between-group inequality. Existing group decompositions of the Gini index along one variable do not control for other characteristics correlated with that variable. Conditional between-group Ginis avoid this pitfall. He also shows how to use unconditional and conditional between-group Ginis for simulating policies. [author] ;Q.T.

eldis:A16545;Forests and floods: drowning in fiction or thriving on facts?;;"This new report from FAO and CIFOR challenges the conventional wisdom linking large-scale flooding to deforestation. The report acknowledges that forests can play a role in minimising runoff that causes localised flooding. But it concludes that there is no evidence that a loss of trees significantly contributes to severe widespread flooding. Even at the local level, the report notes, the flood-reducing effects of forests are heavily dependent on soil depth and structure, and saturation levels, not exclusively on the presence of the trees. Instead the authors believe that the sharp increase in the economic and human losses attributed to flooding is caused not by deforestation but mainly by the simple fact that more people are living and working in flood plains. As a result, many floods that previously would have been only minor events now become major disasters.The authors go on to claim that there can be a political interest in leaving the conventional wisdom about forests and floods unchallenged. For example, they say, it allows governments to simply respond with logging bans and give the appearance to the public they are taking decisive steps to stop flooding. The practical effect of such policies is to force poor farmers—who are routinely portrayed as major perpetrators of ""illegal logging""— to abandon their lands. They give as examples the catastrophic floods in China, Thailand and the Philippines which prompted logging bans that put millions of people out of work. Furthermore international agencies may also have a stake in maintaining the forest-flood ""myth"", according to the report, as it helps in ""channelling aid funds to upland reforestation projects.""The FAO and CIFOR state that it is time for national and international policy makers and development agencies to acknowledge that objective scientific research does not provide easy answers when it comes to understanding flooding. Instead, they point to a complex interplay of natural and man-made conditions that produce major floods and exacerbate their impact. For example, the report notes that large floods always have been a natural—and beneficial—part of the ecosystem. But a range of human activities, such as draining and developing wetlands and damming and altering stream flows, can make them worse. They call for an integrated approach which recognises the limitations of working only in the uplands to minimise floods or only in the lowlands to reduce their damage. Such an approach combines land-use management in the uplands with land-use planning, engineering measures, flood preparedness and emergency management in the lowlands. Crucially, they say, it considers the social and economic needs of communities living in both the mountainous watersheds and the river basins.

Our premise is that ecosystem management is endangered by its ""bigger-is-better"" bias, the potential source of public backlash among landowners. We document both the expansionary nature of ecocentric management and the magnitude of inholdings (encumbered property interests) which accompany it. We contrast ""ecosystem inholders"" with inholders who, historically, have dotted our [USA] national parks, and show the complexity of entitlement in two ecosystem cases, one old and one new. We draw historical parallels between current ecosystem management and the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1970s and, in conclusion, point to the National Environmental Policy Act as an underutilized way to reduce conflict between ecosystem rights and property rights.

eldis:A26924;Staking Their Claims:  Land Disputes in Southern Mozambique;;Conflicting interests in land and resource use emerged in postwar Mozambique, giving rise to multiple layers of dispute. This article explores the disputes occurring between 1992 and 1995 in two districts which are notable for the severity of competition over land by virtue of their proximity to Maputo, namely, Matutuíne and Namaacha. Although private sector claims were beginning to be staked with the potential for displacing people occupying the same land, other conflicts still predominated. Some accompanied the contradictory, complex, and unstable peacetime population movements—people were dispersing into areas abandoned during the war, leaving overcrowded government wartime accommodation centers, and returning from neighboring countries. But, at the same time, insecurity and competition over land contributed to a new process of settlement concentration. In the context of severe drought, high unemployment, and contracting opportunity in South Africa, unemployed labor migrants, urban youth, and demobilized soldiers were attracted to the burgeoning and largely unregulated trades of charcoal-burning, fishing, hunting, and palm-wine tapping. These immigrants came into conflict with returning locals in bitter clashes which often focused primarily on trees, fish, and game rather than on land per se. Attempts to regulate resource exploitation were constrained by the inadequacy and corruptibility of fiscal controls, by armed groups, and by the crisis of authority at local level which characterized both government- and Renamo-administered areas.

eldis:A28427;Recent Developments in Land Tenure Law in Eritrea, Horn of Africa;;Describes the main features of the new Eritrean land law and its operative assumption that the legislation is meant to extend state control over land.The legal devices employed by the law are widely used in sub-Saharan Africa (and were largely inspired by colonial policies). The State of Eritrea frequently asserts that its recent independence gives it the opportunity to learn from other developing countries' mistakes and to avoid them.The basic patterns of the new land law, however, are common to the rest of Africa, notwithstanding the evident poor results. The central government wants its control to be widespread and pervasive. The fight against traditional social groups controlling land, at least in the highlands, is severe. Apart from a formal repeal of customary law, the state's acquisition of the power to modify village boundaries according to a scheme already completed at higher administrative levels and to introduce equal rights on land for women entails a disruption of the villages' social identity.Mandatory state control over landed property in Eritrea is, as usual, motivated by the necessity to address higher social needs. The ultimate intent, of course, is that the evolution from communal property to state property will eventually result in the widespread introduction of individual property once a sufficient level of economic development is achieved.This unfavorable attitude toward communal property is not supported by the evidence, which shows that, in fact, efficient land management can be obtained through renovation of traditional institutions [author] ;L.G.

Compared to the control, the fertilizer treatments had higher yield and fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) profitably. The 27 + 27 kg ha?1 fertilizer rate increased the grain yield by 19, 45 and 46% at Hawassa, Ziway and Melkassa, respectively, and it was equivalent to the higher rates. The value cost  atio (VCR) was highest with the lowest fertilizer rate, varying between seven and 11 in the treatment with 27 + 27 kg ha?1, but two and three in the banding treatment.

The paper states that Egypt hosts about 25% of the total wetland of the Mediterranean Sea, with a shoreline that extends for over 5800 km on the Mediterranean and Red Sea.Results presented in this paper highlight the potential impacts climate change induced coastal inundation in Egypt, including, salt water intrusion, excessive erosion, soil salinisation, deterioration of coral reef and mangrove communities, in addition to vulnerabilities to other changes of climate.Estimates of the socioeconomic implications and expected job losses over the coming few decades have produced alarming figures, the paper claims. In particular, the potential losses of world heritage sites cannot be underestimated.The paper states that preliminary investigations indicated that hard structure protection measures are probably the least costly and best available measure for short-term protection. Whereas long-term protection measures include the most expensive land use changes and integrated coastal zone management.The paper concludes by proposing a number of appropriate mitigation strategies, including:establishment of exit strategies for adaptation in coordination with the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources and Ministry of Tourism based on recent experience of climate variabilityidentification and Assessment of likely future trends based on regional scenarios with emphasis on socio-economic scenariosdevelopment of an information database concerning investment in the coastal zonecarrying out programs of raising awareness of decision makers, stakeholders and NGOs concerning impacts of sea level riseidentification of a coherent set of alternative policy options, priority measures and capacity building for more detailed analysis.This paper was presented at the OECD Global Forum on Sustainable Development: Development and Climate Change, Paris 2004.[adpated from author] ;M.

eldis:A28813;Good practices in drylands management;;"The objectives of this study are to analyze and synthesize the experience of the World Bank and other agencies in dryland management, with special emphasis on Africa.Recommendations are provided on ""good policies and practices"" in drylands management, which can support actions to fulfil obligations arising from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) for member countries and for international organizations, such as the World Bank. The paper focuses primarily on ""good practice"" related to the management of rangelands and dryland farming, and on drought preparedness.Conclusions:The understanding of desertification has undergone major changes over the last two decades. The problem is now seen more as one of reduction in land productivity in the drylands, rather than of productive land turning into desertsCloser studies of long-term landscape changes, of rangeland ecology, of community natural resource management regimes, and of agricultural intensification processes reveal many cases where the resource management practices adopted by the people living in an area have unjustly been seen as degrading the landThere is a need to understand drylands change and management in a local and site-specific context. There is a heterogeneity or variety of causes and consequences of environmental change. These differences effect agricultural development potentials, extension and research strategies, and natural resources management. Each country and region requires a different strategyStrategies to improve drylands management must build on a greater appreciation of the skills with which drylands people allocate resources and use opportunities, and of the constraints they face. Interventions by governments and donors must utilize the knowledge of local people, and be based on their views of what is appropriateResource management should be more participatory. However devolving power to local communities is not free from problems. Communties are usually heterogeneous groups, prone to be dominated by local elites. Delineation of landscape can cause disputes over border issues or shared resourcesDrought preparedness should be a primary concernEfforts to reduce dryland degradation require intensification in agriculture, translated as more efficient use of land, labor and capital, related to technological,  institutional and policy innovationsThe basic preconditions for improved drylands management are government concern, political will, and commitment. Focusing more attention on how government commitment is created and sustained - the political economy of drylands management - is therefore important. [authors] ";"R. Oygard

eldis:A65590;"Lineage and land reforms in Malawi: do matrilineal and patrilineal landholding systems represent a problem for land reforms in Malawi?""";;"This paper is about land tenure relations among the matrilineal and patrilineal cultures in Malawi. Data from the National Agricultural and Livestock Census are used to characterize marriage systems and settlement and landholding patterns for local communities. Marriage systems correspond to customary land tenure patterns of matrilineal or patrilineal land holding. The differences between the two major ways of land holding represent a particular challenge for land reforms intending to unify rules for land tenure and land devolution.

The paper discusses the problems of formalisation and the idea of maintaining the diversity. If diversity is not respected there is a chance that some sections of society, especially communities with matrilineal land holding, might be victims of formalization. Based on analogy of the resilience of the patrilineal land holding system in Norway it is argued that a democratic system will have difficulty removing the preferential rights of linage members and it is recommended that the existing land rights are formally recognized and circumscribed by fair procedures.

In a situation of diversity one goal of a well-designed land holding system should be to ease the transitions of the diverse customary tenure systems towards systems adapted to the requirements of a modern large scale society rather than to a unified national system.

eldis:A27100;Capital Outflow from the Agriculture Sector in Thailand;;To understand Thailand's policy on development and industrialization, one must also study its policy on trade and agriculture. Certain Thai policies have facilitated economic development in Thailand: Raising agricultural productivity even during the early period of import substitution.      The relatively equal distribution of land.  Decentralized industrial growth.  The labor-intensive export orientation of both rural and urban industries.      Generally open, merit-based access to education. Yamada studies capital flows between Thailand's agriculture and nonagriculture sectors, focusing especially on government policy for agriculture, which shapes government-based flows. He measures government- and market-based flows of both the agriculture sector and agricultural regions. Until the 1960s, Thailand's economy depended heavily on agriculture and most of the workforce was agricultural. Since the 1960s, Thailand has promoted industry. Between 1961 and 1991, agriculture continued to grow but because non-agriculture sectors grew even faster, agriculture's share of GDP fell from 37 percent to 13 percent. But agriculture still employs the majority of the labor force and still receives the third largest budget allocations (after education and national defense). Many believe that Thai development was made possible by capital accumulation based on an agricultural surplus. To some extent, the role of that surplus before 1975 should not be underestimated. But the government-based flow of capital from agriculture (measured as a percentage of GDP) was less than 6 percent in the 1960s and early 1970s (except for three years), and the market-based flow was only 3 percent of GDP in 1971, 2.5 percent in 1981, and 1.9 percent in 1991 (measured as deposits minus commercial bank lending). So capital flows from agriculture have not been as large as is typically assumed. Since the 1970s, the government has adopted an export-oriented policy emphasizing labor-intensive light industry, and investments to promote labor-intensive industries in rural areas has created jobs for rural people. With a fair level of investment in rural areas, the environment in rural areas is not drastically worse than that in urban areas (unlike Latin American and African countries), and migration to urban areas has been limited in Thailand. The government-based inflow (government credit for, and investment in, agriculture) was significantly greater for large farms areas than for small-farm areas. This might be attributable less to the political power of large-farm owners than to industrialization in Thailand's central region. [author] ;J.

eldis:A12731;Finding the way forward: how could voluntary action move mining towards sustainable development?;;"This report is primarily based on a review of research into the role of voluntary activities in the mining sector. The possible development of a global voluntary initiative (or initiatives) is a theme explored here in greater detail by addressing the following questions:What are the key drivers for sustainable development in the mining industry?What could voluntary initiatives achieve in the sector?What voluntary initiatives currently exist?What form of voluntary initiative is best?The report finds that there are few similarities among the initiatives currently in use in the mining and other sectors – this may reflect tailoring of initiatives to their respective goals, but it may also indicate a lack of sharing or development between initiatives. In the mining sector, there are indications that a high degree of confusion exists about which initiatives are appropriate and useful; in some companies, a feeling of ‘initiative overload’ heightens this uncertainty.Most initiatives fall into two categories:‘Broad guiding principles’ require a low level of commitment and hence tend to attract many signatories‘Differentiation mechanisms’, with third-party assurance against well-defined performance standards, may require a significant compliance effort from companies and tend to receive a lower uptake rateArguably, initiatives of both types are struggling to deliver real change in environmental and social conditions ‘on the ground’.A real ‘net move’ towards sustainable development by any  industry sector can only be achieved by initiatives that require a concrete commitment from signatories to improve performance but that also attract high uptake by fulfilling a key ‘need’ or by linking to a significant driver for business performance. Few if any initiatives fulfil these requirements at present, although many existing schemes have only recently been developed and may yet grow to fill this role. Examples include the Forest Stewardship Council, a certification scheme for sustainably sourced forest products.The mining industry cannot address the challenge of sustainable development on its own; its operations are too closely interlinked with government, communities, the financial sector, and wider societal expectations. Certification is one option, however, that could draw the industry and key stakeholders together around an agreed definition of best practice. ";"J. Walker

eldis:A100796;Review of the projected impacts of climate change on coastal fishes in southern Africa ;;The coastal zone represents one of the most economically and ecologically important ecosys- tems on the planet, none more so than in southern Africa. This manuscript examines the potential impacts of climate change on the coastal fishes in southern Africa and provides some of the first information for the Southern Hemisphere, outside of Australasia. It begins by describing the coastal zone in terms of its physical characteristics, climate, fish biodiversity and fisheries. The region is divided into seven biogeographical zones based on previous descriptions and interpretations by the authors. A global review of the impacts of climate change on coastal zones is then applied to make qualitative predictions on the likely impacts of climate change on migratory, resident, estuarine-dependent and catadro- mous fishes in each of these biogeographical zones.In many respects the southern African region represents a microcosm of climate change variability and of coastal habitats. Based on the broad range of climate change impacts and life history styles of coastal fishes, the predicted impacts on fishes will be diverse. The authors state that this review reveals that there is lack of fundamental knowledge in this field, in particular in southern Africa. Several research priorities, including the need for process-based fundamental research programs are highlighted. ;"W.M. Potts

eldis:A38550;Water democracy: reclaiming public water in Asia;;"Water crisis is largely a problem of governance. While there is an obvious bias towards privatisation as a solution to the water sector problems, the last few years have also seen many social mobilisations, consolidation of forces, and hard-won battles for peoples and communities’ water struggles, particularly in defending water as a human right.This collection of 19 essays by civil society activists, trade unionists and other water practitioners, give an overview of these developments in the water sector by presenting examples of both struggles against water privatisation and people-centred public water management from across Asia.The papers show that

    the ideology-driven privatization wave has now also reached Asian countries where public water delivery has been very successful. 
    in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan, where public utilities have largely achieved water for all, the governments are planning to boost the role of the private sector. 
    in Malaysia, the process of widespread privatisation has already led to predictable problems such as increased tariff
    in India, Cambodia, Indonesia and many other Asian countries where large parts of the population have for far too long remained without adequate access to water and sanitation, concrete, workable alternatives to water privatisation do exist.
    public water solutions are being developed and implemented in numerous Asian countries, i.e. progressive public water management models, often involving new forms of local cooperation between public water operators, communities, trade unions and other key groups.
    experiences in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala show that empowerment of communities and the democratisation of governance are strong positive tools for improving public water supply
    an important new trend is the emergence of public-public partnerships (PUPs), in which a well performing water operator assists a utility in need of support. Examples include PUPs in Indonesia and Cambodia

The overall conclusion is that although numerous public water utilities in large parts of Asia fail to supply safe water for all, privatisation is not the answer. The papers here show that there is no lack of workable public service reform approaches that could dramatically improve access to water supply and sanitation for people across the continent, if the political will is there.

eldis:A73770;By the gun or by the bribe: Firm size, environmental governance and corruption among mining companies in Guatemala;;"This U4 Issue discusses the corruption risks faced by mining companies in Guatemala, with a particular focus on the risks faced by small, “junior” mining companies primarily engaged in exploration. Several factors make such companies highly prone to engaging in corrupt behavior, especially when operating in weak institutional contexts: the highly competitive nature of the mining industry, the risky dynamics of the exploration stage, and the specific characteristics of junior companies – their short operational timelines, low reputational risks, highly mobile and flexible nature, and reliance on fickle venture capital. Additionally, public environmental governance, and in particularly the approval of the environmental impact assessment, represents a moment of acute vulnerability to corruption, particularly for junior companies. In order to mitigate corruption risks among junior mining companies, donor agencies should help to build community capacity to monitor mining operations, build central state government capacity for environmental governance, work with countries to improve the rigor for environmental impact assessment processes, increase the visibility and reputational risks for junior companies, and build cultures of compliance in junior companies’ countries of origin as well as within companies.

eldis:A24483;Forest dependence and participation in forest co-management in Malawi;;Using data from Chimaliro and Liwonde forest reserves in Malawi, this paper investigates how forest dependence influences households' decision to participate in forest co-management programme.  The key question of this paper is: What makes people participate in the forest comanagement (FCM) programme in Malawi? In particular, how does forest dependence (share of forest income) affect households’ participation decisions?The authors find that where forests primarily have a gap filling or safety net role in Chimaliro, high forest dependency induces higher rates of participation. However, with more commercial forest uses and a more heterogeneous social context as in Liwonde, high forest dependency reduces the incentives for participation.The findings point to the need to design parallel interventions alongside the forest co-management program in order to provide supplementary income sources to participants and increase the incentives for participation. ;"C.B.L.

eldis:A12741;Extractive industries and sustainable development: an evaluation of World Bank Group experience (volume one: overview);;The World Bank Group (WBG) has the potential to improve the contribution of extractive industries (EI) to sustainable development and poverty reduction.  However, this report by the WBG’s operations evaluation departments finds that although its EI projects have produced positive economic and financial results, it has not been successful in ensuring compliance to environmental and social safeguards.  The paper examines the World Bank, the IFC and MIGA, to assess their performance in moving away from a focus on economic benefits towards sustainable development, addressing the governance challenges associated with resource-rich countries, and mitigating environmental and social costs of the extractive industry.The paper finds that the WBG has not devoted enough attention to the developmental needs of poorly performing resource-abundant countries, and can do much to improve its performance. In particular it recommends that the WBG should:Formulate an integrated strategy that starts with the presumption that successful projects should not only provide returns to investors but should also provide revenues for governments, mitigate negative environmental and social effects and benefit local communities. To this they mustformulate a WBG sector strategy: that encourages sustainable development and the reliable mitigation of adverse environmental and social impacts. The WBG should not support sector expansion unless it can mitigate these risksaddress EI in Country Assistance Strategies (CAS): CAS should explicitly discuss the sector’s current and potential economy-wide linkages in order to guide future project design, facilitate monitoring and evaluation and provide a framework for WBG-wide coordination and collaboration in the sectorpromote governance improvements: by devoting greater management attention and administrative budget for advisory and analytical activities aimed at improving the policy, institutional, and governance framework for EI for resource-rich countries with weak macro and sectoral governancesupport private sector development and environmental sustainability: by continuing to support closure of uneconomic mines, reform and privatise state-owned enterprises, and mitigate pre-existing environmental and social problemsStrengthen project implementation: rigorous implementation of safeguard policies by the WBG is a minimum requirement for it to operate sustainably. The WBG needs to more systematically define, monitor, document, and report on the economic, social and environmental impacts of its projects.  Specifically, the distribution of benefits needs to be explicitly monitored and evaluated:improve project screening and monitoring: by providing clear and consistent guidance for categorising projects, identifying applicable safeguards, the appropriate scope and nature of instruments, and reporting and evaluation of safeguards implementationinvolve specialists throughout: by providing adequate resources and incentives for the participation of qualified environmental and social specialists at the preparation, appraisal and supervision of all projects likely to have adverse impactsenhance reporting of results: by strengthening reporting of its results by ensuring that project completion reports includeex posteconomic rate of return or net present valueevaluate the sharing of benefits: by estimating the distribution of project benefits among different stakeholder groups (government, private companies, local communities), the acceptability of benefit sharing should be discussed with key stakeholder groupsEngage with stakeholders:the WBG has played an important convening role bringing different stakeholders together, but it has inadequately addressed some areas – notably governance and revenue management.  The WBG’s performance in these areas can be enhanced through improved consultation with stakeholders (including local communities) and by systematically and transparently reporting on key sustainability indicatorsupdate policy framework: by consulting with stakeholders to periodically adjust the policy framework to reflect evolving industry practice and to address identified gaps such as those related to consultation and disclosure, community development, social issues of mine closure, security, hazardous materials management and gas flaring. It should also recognise the expanding awareness of the human rights dimensions of WBGs policiespromote disclosure of fiscal revenues from EI: by vigorously pursuing country- and industry- wide disclosure of government revenues from EI. The Bank should work toward and support disclosure of EI revenues and their use in resource-rich countries.  The IFC and MIGA should also consider requiring their private sector clients to publish their payments to governmentsdevelop and monitor sustainability indicators: by consulting with stakeholders to develop indicators of economic, social and environmental sustainability, establish baseline data, provide adequate monitoring, and report and evaluate the results during supervision and in project completion reports.  The WBG should encourage independent outside monitoring, ideally using local capacityincrease local community participation: throughout the life cycle of EI-projects. The WBG should assist countries to increase community involvement in EI decision-making processes, and ongoing consultation throughout the project life cycle, including closure ;;;Operations Evaluations Division, World Bank;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"development;extractive industries;sustainable development";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12741;http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/24cc3bb1f94ae11c85256808006a0046/fb2a79b1eb4b9a4d85256d7a00750357/$FILE/Extractive_Industries_Evaluation_Overview.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flnweb18.worldbank.org%2Foed%2Foeddoclib.nsf%2F24cc3bb1f94ae11c85256808006a0046%2Ffb2a79b1eb4b9a4d85256d7a00750357%2F%24FILE%2FExtractive_Industries_Evaluation_Overview.pdf;;;;"MIGA;Corporate Social Responsibility;social impact;Extractive industries;sustainable development;evaluation;Finance policy;environmental impact;International Financial Institutions;extractive industries;ifc;World Bank;IFIs World Bank and IMF"
eldis:A60151;Adaptation to climate change and desertification: Perspectives from national policy and autonomous practice in Malawi;;This paper explores the ways in which the interlinked challenges of climate change and desertification are managed in Malawi. The authors examine the synergy and conflict between local autonomous adaptation strategies and national adaptation policies, which are in accordance with international commitments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Malawi’s National Action Programmes (NAPs), that cover desertification issues, and the National Adaptation Programmes for Action (NAPA) still fall short of defining specific roles for the local government in supporting adaptation strategies, specifically in urban areas, which, it is argued, is indicative of a weak vertical synergy. The article assesses the extent of support offered across various levels of administration in order to address climate change and desertification issues, along with support given to autonomous adaptation at the community level. The article concludes that policy on desertification and climate change is poorly mainstreamed towards development processes, and suggests that national policy should facilitate local adaptation strategies to enhance resilience at a community level. ;"L., C Stringer

eldis:A42794;Rice land grabs undermine food sovereignty in Africa;;In the wake of the 2008 global food crisis, African capitals have been buzzing with renewed talk of the need for food self-sufficiency, and rice is often at the top of government agendas. Although everyone agrees on the need to increase production, the solutions coming out of the corridors of power boil down to the old formula of getting more fertilizers and “high-yielding” seeds to farmers. In the eyes of the decision-makers, this inevitably means either Chinese hybrid rice seeds or the Nerica rice seeds developed by the African Rice Centre, and backed by the most powerful donors and research institutes operating on the continent. The traditional knowledge and seeds of African farmers, which feed and provide livelihoods for the majority of people on the continent, are completely ignored.This report gives an example from Mali, which like several other countries in West Africa, recently went from being a net rice exporter to being a major importer. The government embarked on a multimillion dollar national rice initiative that was supposed to restore self-sufficiency by helping the country’s farmers to produce more. Unfortunately, this was done by handing over an enormous tract of prime rice land to an external investment fund and companies. The report concludes that while most African governments are proclaiming their commitments to food self-sufficiency, they are signing an alarming number of deals with foreign investors behind the backs of their people that give these investors control over their countries’ most important agricultural lands, including areas allocated for rice. These forces are threatening to take away the seeds and lands of small-scale food producers – the very basis of their capacity to feed people and to assure their livelihoods. ;;;GRAIN;eldis;01/01/2009;en;"food security;land grabs;land";Land & Food Security;;202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A42794;http://www.grain.org/articles_files/atg-19-en.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grain.org%2Farticles_files%2Fatg-19-en.pdf;;;;"Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Agriculture and food;Food security;agricultural lands;Africa;Soil and land management;Role of agriculture in development;food crisis;Land issues;Mali;national rice initiative"
eldis:A13081;Tackling gender issues in sustainable land management;;This toolkit provides a framework for main-streaming gender in rural development activities.It addresses the lack of conceptual and practical tools in the area of sustainable land management. Its modular design allows for individual approaches and targets development staff at the project and programme levels, with the aim of helping them to find practical ways of dealing with gender issues in rural development activities.

eldis:A8750;Democracy and deforestation. The politics of protecting the forests;;How can the process of tropical deforestation be controlled? We now know a good deal about the causes of deforestation but not its control. Research from the University of Leeds in Thailand and the Philippines fills this gap, showing that changes in the domestic political scene explain how deforestation processes have been controlled in the two countries. Environmental constraints and increases in agricultural productivity can curb the demand for farmland to some extent. Controlling deforestation will depend ultimately, however, on domestic political pressures demanding a change in policy and on the capacity of implementing institutions to carry them through to fruition. ;Alan Grainger;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"environment;land use;deforestation;agriculture;capacity building";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;PHL";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A8750;http://www.id21.org/society/2cld9.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fsociety%2F2cld9.html;;;;"deforestation;Ecology;tropical forest;capacity building;land use;Environment;land use Thailand;forestry deforestation;green revolution;Democratisation;Environment and Forestry;forestry deforestation solutions;farming;agriculture;institutions;policymaking"
eldis:A16719;Society and the uncivil state: land tenure reform in Egypt and the crisis of rural livelihoods;;This paper examines the impact of recent changes in the relationship between landowners and tenants in Egypt.  The paper explores the links between economic and political liberalisation, specifically rural livelihoods, asset redistribution and land tenure.The author identifies two questions relating to Egypt’s rural areas that the government is reluctant to address.the likely outcome of the state’s withdrawal from the provision of agricultural inputswhether civil society organisations have been able to substitute for the state’s withdrawal from agricultural provision, whether this has ushered in a new era for political liberalisation and democratisation.Donors and the government intended the 1992 reform of tenancy to promote improvements in Egypt’s land market and, in parallel, enhanced opportunities for rural political expression. However this has not taken place. Market liberalisation has generated greater rural poverty and unemployment, resulting in greater dependence on family resources for the peasants.The author argues that the current land reform situation in Egypt is characterised by the devastation of agricultural co-operatives, the non-existent rural trade unions, and agricultural research centres that are keen to accrue donor resources via economic liberalisation. ;R.

eldis:A44566;Micro-level analysis of farmers' adaptation to climate change in Southern Africa;;Adaptation to climate change involves changes in agricultural management practices in response to changes in climate conditions. It often involves a combination of various individual responses at the farm-level and assumes that farmers have access to alternative practices and technologies available in the region. This study examines farmer adaptation strategies to climate change in Southern Africa based on a cross-section database of three countries (South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) collected as part of the Global Environment Facility/World Bank (GEF/WB) Climate Change and African Agriculture Project. The study describes farmer perceptions to changes in long-term temperature and precipitation as well as various farm-level adaptation measures and barriers to adaptation at the farm household level. A multivariate discrete choice model is used to identify the determinants of farm-level adaptation strategies. Results confirm that access to credit and extension and awareness of climate change are some of the important determinants of farm-level adaptation. An important policy message from these results is that enhanced access to credit, information (climatic and agronomic) as well as to markets (input and output) can significantly increase farm-level adaptation. Government policies should support research and development on appropriate technologies to help farmers adapt to changes in climatic conditions. Examples of such policy measures include crop development, improving climate information forecasting, and promoting appropriate farm-level adaptation measures such as use of irrigation technologies.

eldis:A24174;Will pastoral legislation disempower pastoralists in the Sahel?;;Guinea, Mauritania, Mali, and Burkina Faso have all passed specific legislation in support of pastoralism. This paper reports that while some of these laws provide an improved framework for the management of rangelands and greater tenure security for pastoralists, they contain conceptual and practical problems which may ultimately further marginalise pastoral people.Crucially, the new legislation seeks to manage access to resources through complicated procedures controlled by various levels of government. In doing so, pastoral communities are disempowered as they neither understanding nor have any control over these provisions. Livestock mobility could be reduced and the authors fear that elites could ultimately capture exclusive rights to water and land. The report recommends that these issues be urgently addressed.In order for local communities to benefit from decentralisation, they must:build their capacities to influence local government decision-making and hold them accountable, particularly over land and other natural resourcespastoralists must learn to articulate a vision for pastoralism that can be understood by policymakersIn turn, policymakers themselves need to better understand the Sahelian pastoralist environments, the role social and political networks play in the management of natural resources and the central place of pastoralism as a viable system and major contributor to national economies.In summary, the paper concludes that pastoralists, through their associations, have to develop the necessary “leverage” to ensure that improved knowledge and understanding is actually used to improve policy and legislation in support of pastoralism as a livelihood system. ;"C.

eldis:A38014;Farmers' voices: practical perspectives on land reform and agricultural development;;"This report details the findings of a round table discussion on land reform and agricultural development in South Africa convened by The Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE) in October 2007. Bringing together a cross-section of farmers and other role players in agriculture from farming regions across the country, the round table discussion aimed to help identify a way forward for land restitution, redistributive justice and sustainable agriculture. The authors claim that important insights emerged from the discussion that are not being sufficiently emphasised in the ongoing public debate on land reform in the country. These include: 

    the extent of land under claim in commercial agriculture sectors (at least fifty percent in the sugar industry, thrity to forty percent in the timber industry) 
    the serious negative consequences of having such large tracts of land under claim for extended periods of time 
    the great likelihood that the restitution process will not be completed in 2008 
    the weakness of current state capacity, which is complicating the land restitution and redistribution process, and in many cases preventing the positive outcomes which the country needs 
    the disjuncture between current approaches to restitution and redistribution and the realities of commercial agriculture
    the serious accumulation of negatives in the agricultural sector, leading to declining investment in the domestic sector and the diversification of South African agriculture to other countries 

The authors conclude that land reform in any country is difficult, but that everyone has underestimated the complexity of getting this right in South Africa. They argue that a government-led environment must be urgently created in which frank discussion of the issues involved is encouraged and practical solutions found. The challenge is not the lack of goodwill, or farmers who are unwilling to participate positively in the process. Instead, they claim that a mix of dynamics - including the complexity of what is being attempted – are now producing a situation with unintended and serious negative consequences.  ";"A.

eldis:A65054;Protecting carbon to destroy forests: land enclosures and REDD+;;This paper argues that REDD+ will not stop forest destruction developing countries and the underlying causes of deforestation remain untouched. The paper suggests that because REDD+ is embedded in the logic that environmental destruction in one location can be ‘compensated’ in another, it acts to reinforce the underlying drivers of deforestation and climate change. It also gives forest destroyers a way to legitimise their actions as environmentally ‘friendly’ or ‘carbon neutral’. The paper continues that far from positioning itself as an ally to the many local groups that have preserved forested lands most strongly, REDD+ tends to silence debates about the unjust realities surrounding corporate pressures on land tenure regimes. The paper aims to provide a historical background and experiences on the ground in order to further the argument that because land and nature enclosures are central to its operation, REDD+ cannot be fixed. ;;;Transnational Institute ;eldis;01/01/2013;en;"climate change;land use;land;research";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A65054;http://www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/redd_and_land-web.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tni.org%2Fsites%2Fwww.tni.org%2Ffiles%2Fdownload%2Fredd_and_land-web.pdf;;;;"Climate change Forestry;Climate change;Land use;REDD;CDKN;research;Climate change mitigation;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;Climate change agriculture and food security;tfmimport;Funder;theme:cc forests"

eldis:A71957;Land grabbing in Latin America: opportunity or threat? ;;"In Latin America, government interventions in land grabbing processes provide some preliminary lessons on dealing with this phenomenon, while highlighting some serious threats.

This Brief presents cases of land grabbing in Latin America and explores the controversy around this phenomenon. It reviews the causes and characteristics of land grabbing around the world and specifies the ways in which land grabbing in Latin America differs from typical scenarios in Africa and Asia. In particular, this Brief explains the history behind land grabbing for soybean production in the so-called Soybean Republic (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and examines the strategies employed by the Argentine and Brazilian governments to capitalise on economic  opportunities presented by the current boom in this sector. The Brief also presents some initial policy responses that are intended to improve state control over foreign land purchases. Finally, it identifies the main enabling factors behind this process and summarises some key policy lessons.

Key lessons:


	land grabbing is a global phenomenon, yet it is also context specific. Public policy must be based on an understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of land grabs at different scales – national, regional and global – in order that this trend can lead to sustainable economic benefits and poverty reduction
	restricting land ownership can control land foreignisation without limiting the potential of the host nation to generate revenue from consolidation processes. This policy is proving to be particularly effective where backed by public investment in research and development
	latin American experience shows that the effectiveness of state intervention in controlling land grabs depends on two main factors: domestic and regional political power and institutional capacity to regulate land transactions and control the agricultural sector

eldis:A14968;Nepal: breaking new ground: leasehold forestry in Nepal: hills leasehold forestry and forage development project;;"This document presents the results of an evaluation of an IFAD project aimed at preventing land degradation in Nepal. The project is based on leasehold forestry, an innovative approach introduced by IFAD in the early 1990s. It works by providing forty-year leases to groups of households and giving them user rights over plots of degraded forest land. They then rehabilitate the land by banning grazing and by stall-feeding their livestock, and use and sell forest products such as timber, fuel wood and fodder.Outcomes of the project include:1,800 household groups were given user rights over plots of degraded forest land totalling 7,400 hectaresonce restored, the forest areas are a rich source of fodder, timber, and fuel as well as trees and plants that the groups use and sellgoat ownership has increased from an average of two to five per household, as has revenue from goat salesincome from grasses, grass seeds and other forest products is now significantweak market linkages and inadequate information concerning demand and market prices have limited sales in some areasthe 120 leasehold inter-groups and 18 multi-purpose cooperatives created during the project have been instrumental in tackling these issues due to their strong bargaining power and success in creating market outlets.Key insights from the evaluation include:the leasehold approach adopted so far is costly and needs adapting into a simpler, cheaper solution if it is to be scaled upcontinued collaboration and policy dialogue between the donor agencies supporting ""community forestry"" and IFAD, which supports the leasehold approach, is necessary to try to establish common ground between the two approachesforage improvement packages need to be more flexible, to focus on local knowledge and the natural regeneration of plants and trees rather than importing species that are costly and often unsuited to the soils and climate of the Nepalese hillsidesbetter use of technical assistance grants (for IFAD-supported projects) to strengthen project management capacities, train government staff and build sustainable organisations of leaseholders is crucialleasehold groups and cooperatives played a crucial role in creating market linkages, improving access to marketing information and providing financial, training and advocacy services.[adapted from author] ";;;Office of Evaluation and Studies, IFAD;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"development;forestry;land tenure;environment;community forestry;rural development;land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"NPL;034";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14968;http://www.ifad.org/evaluation/public_html/eksyst/doc/profile/pi/np.htm;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifad.org%2Fevaluation%2Fpublic_html%2Feksyst%2Fdoc%2Fprofile%2Fpi%2Fnp.htm;;;;"Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Environment;Environmental policies and management;Environment and Forestry;Rural development;Nepal;Soil and land management;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;Community forestry;soil erosion;Environmental protection natural resource management;Leasehold approach;Forest policies and management;land degradation;Agricultural policy"

eldis:A42153;Towards integrated natural resources management (INRM) in dry areas subject to land degradation: the example of the Khanasser valley in Syria;;"Using the Khanasser Valley in Syria as an example, this paper looks at Integrated Natural Resource management (INRM) as an approach to tackle land degradation. The authors argue that INRM is a better approach because of its comprehensive nature and simplification of the inherently complex socio-ecological systems. One of the greatest challenges currently facing humankind is the alleviation of poverty while maintaining life support systems. Many people are dependent on natural resources that are often unsustainably used by poor people themselves or by other powerful stakeholders. Drylands face a number of converging trends that include: high population growth rates, water scarcity, increasing dependency on grain imports for food security, increasing migration from rural areas, problems of restrictive international trade policies and subsidies, among others. The authors argue that INRM aims to help solve complex real-world problems affecting natural resources in agro-ecosystems. The main strategy to achieve this is to foster and improve the adaptive capacity and learning of all the involved stakeholders. The authors give a number of strategic directions that will facilitate this process by merging research and development, setting up a system for adapting and learning, and balancing biophysical and socio-economic sciences.In order to have a successful INRM Framework, the authors present a list of recommendations. 

    It is essential that Natural Resource (NR) managers, extension officers and researchers all participate from the initiation of the research 
    Scaling out and up should become part of the research process rather than a delivery mechanism for a finished product 
    The relevant stakeholders should be involved 
    Capacity building for INRM should be assessed in a wider perspective 
    In order to make a real impact, changes in NRM must be owned and internalised by NR managers and other stakeholders
    An alternative approach to impact assessment should be used to measure the improved performance of the system and the ability of the NR managers at various levels to adapt to external change 
    For knowledge management, proper database management, reporting skills and the ability to translate scientific findings in simple and clear messages are essential 
    Improved analytical skill is needed to integrate formal knowledge with informal knowledge

eldis:A33776;China in Burma: the increasing investment of Chinese multinational corporations in Burma’s hydropower, oil and gas, and mining sectors;;"While increasing attention has been paid to Chinese attempts to secure natural resources overseas, the case of Burma has often been overlooked. This background provides a summary of the operations of Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs) in Burma in the hydro, oil & gas, and mining sectors. The research finds that more than 26 Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs) are involved in more than 62 hydropower, oil & gas, and mining projects in Burma. The report describes the activities of Chinese MNCs in Burma which include the following:

    14 Chinese companies are involved in approximately 40 hydropower projects
    the largest hydro project involving China is the Tasang Dam on the on the Salween River, which is
    China currently has at least 17 onshore and offshore oil and gas projects in Burma, with investment from at least seven companies, including the three major Chinese oil and gas companies
    Chinese MNCs have announced the construction of an oil – and a parallel natural gas – pipeline, which would stretch for 2,380 km from Burma’s Arakan coast to China’s southwestern cities of Kunming and/or Chongqing
    at least five Chinese MNCs have been involved in five major mining projects over the past three years
    the largest mining project is the Tagaung Taung nickel deposit which represents an investment of US$ 600 million. 

The paper concludes that as China increases its position and influence in the world, the country has an opportunity to create a different model of natural resource extraction and investment. The report argues that the Government of China should keep a close control and regulate its own corporations operating overseas by ensuring that MNCs: 

    abide by domestic Chinese standards
    increase transparency about operations 
    undertake environmental and social impact assessment

eldis:A75130;The cost of redistributive land reform in the Philippines: assessment of PD 27 and RA 6657 (CARL) ;;"This paper examines the cost of implementing redistributive land reform in the Philippines. Land redistribution has become the core feature of land reform in the country since 1972 with the approval of PD 27. The coverage of the program was expanded to all agricultural lands under RA 6657 or CARL of 1988. Consequently, funding for land reform increased significantly as government chose to fully subsidize land acquisition, distribution, and transfers. From 1972 to 2008, the cost to implement the program has been rising in real terms both in absolute and relative values. The substantial increases in unit cost have been traced to administrative expense and compensation to landowners. Landowners’ compensation (LOC) is a major cost item specifically as land reform shifted from a confiscatory scheme to market land valuation. But the impact of market valuation has not been reflected in the initial years of CARP. It appears that most lands acquired in the early years of CARP are marginal lands thus the lower valuation compared to PD 27 which covered mostly irrigated lands with yields higher than average.

The impact of market valuation on LOC has been felt in Phase II of CARP when the program started covering lands planted to higher value crops. Over time, land reform has become a major burden to taxpayers and fully subsidizing the program is not tenable due to fiscal constraints and a growing consensus among scholars that land reform as a strategy to agriculture development has become passé. These same issues are likely to face the extension of CARP in the next five years. Government has to seriously consider alternative ways to land redistribution and alternative programs to achieve land equity and poverty reduction.

This paper suggests the following strategies: (1) facilitate negotiated land reform specifically for high value crops; (2) a leaner and rationalized DAR bureaucracy; and (3) effective land tax policy.

eldis:A20083;Israel and the Occupied Territories: conflict, occupation and patriarchy, women carry the burden;;"This report deals with the impact of violence against women in the Occupied Territories in the context of conflict, including violence committed by the Israeli state or its agents; the collapse of the rule of law within the Occupied Territories leading to a lack of implementation of existing laws; and the worsening effects of existing discrimination in both law and practice. This report highlights the gender related impact of violations committed by the Israeli forces in the context of conflict. It then looks at gender-based violence within the family and the impact of the militarization of the conflict by both sides on Palestinian women living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The report is part of the global Amnesty International campaign to Stop Violence Against Women. The campaign highlights the impact of gender-based and gender-related violence against women in conflict and in the family; and calls for states and communities to refrain from committing violence, prevent violence being committed by others and ensure that discrimination in law, custom and practice is ended. The report shows that the impact of the conflict on Palestinian women in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has lead to widespread violations of their rights – both civil and political such as the right to life, liberty and security of the person as well as economic, social and cultural rights- such as the right to health, housing and education. It highlights some of the main violations to which women have been subjected in the context of increased political violence, combined with existing and heightened pressures they face in a patriarchal society.

eldis:A25289;Cities without land markets : location and land use in the socialist city;;"How do the spatial dynamics of the socialist city compare with those of the market city? What happens to a city when all investment decisions are made without land markets? What are the outcomes when the forces described by familiar urban models are not allowed to work?Bertaud and Renaud describe the structure of Russian cities after 70 years of Soviet development. This is the longest socialist experience on record and its results are of paramount interest to urban economists.In the absence of price signals and of economic incentives to recycle land over time, the administrative command process has led to a startling pattern of land use. Its central feature is a perverse population density gradient, which rises as one moves away from the center of the city. (Driving from the center of Moscow, one passes through rings of Stalinera, Khrushchevera, and then Brezhnevera flats.)The Soviet city is also characterized by rusting factories in prime locations and high density residential areas in distant suburbs. Such a structure tends to maximize the economic and social inefficiency of the socialist city as well as its environmental ill effects.With market oriented urban reform, real estate prices are now emerging. Their negative gradient signals again the massive scale of past land misallocation in the Soviet city.The experience of socialist cities is also a powerful warning about the ill effects of public ownership and the allocation of land to achieve the ""socialization"" of land rents.This paper a joint product of the Transport Division, Transportation, Water, and Urban Development Department and the Financial Sector Development Department are the result of a program of technical cooperation carried out between the Russian Federation and the World Bank.

eldis:A21573;Land Registration in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia;;"This case study assesses the strengths and weaknesses of a simple, inexpensive, village-based land registration system put in place between 1996 and 1998 in Tigray, Ethiopia.The authors found that the system worked well and fairly - in large part due to it’s simplicity and low cost. Success also depended, however, on effective local governments which were able to prevent inequities from unforeseen shortcomings. At the same time, those same shortcomings are analysed and also serve as lessons: that the choice of a land description technology has consequences in use; that title is a legal conclusion that must be constantly updated to be reliable; that registering all the land of a household together under the name of the household head may lead to unnecessary recording problems and inequities when transactions, such as divorce, occur; and that intersections between registration systems (e.g., urban/rural, individual/community, small-holder/investor, cultivated/forested) may create problems.
The report concludes that:the Tigray process proves that land registration is not inherently anti-poor in its impactsthe distributional consequences of land registration will depend on the design of the process and governance of the institutions responsible for its managementland registration procedures can be elaborated which systematically address the risk of bias against poorer, more marginal groups, by considering:locationregistration feeslanguage usedrecognition of secondary rightsBased on these findings certain continuity, and certain changes, are recommended.This report forms part of a series of seven papers based on a research programme entitled “Securing Land Rights in Africa: Can land registration serve the poor?” led by IIED.

eldis:A14468;Land tenure in the Highlands of Eritrea: economic theory and empirical evidence;;This PhD study focuses on the land tenure systems in the highlands of Eritrea with a particular emphasis on land rental markets, land contract choice, and on the implications of land tenure systems for farm household’s resource allocation behaviour and efficiency outcomes.The author hopes that the theoretical and empirical analysis of these issues will also contribute to the debate on land tenure and economic development in general and the land policy issue in Eritrea in particular.The study empirically analyses four issues of land tenure in the highlands of Eritrea, namely:factor market imperfections and the land rental marketthe theoretical and empirical works on land contract choiceland tenure security, resource allocation and land productivityproduction efficiency across land contract typesThe main findings of the study include: by transferring land from less able to the more able households, land rental markets improve resource allocation, help reduce land fragmentation, and increase land productivity. Policies that improve the working of the land rental markets should thus be encouragedtenure security is found to affect investment and land productivity positively. Therefore, policies that enhance tenure security by extending duration of tenure are likely to result in higher investment in medium and long-term land improving inputs and hence increased land productivity. There is a need to reform the land redistribution system to allow sufficient duration of tenure and to introduce land tenure laws that allow and encourage long-term leasingthere is a possibility that the elimination of the land distribution system and or the its extension would produce an army of landless unemployed people in the rural areas. This possibility may not be a realistic scenario in light of the evidences indicating labour market imperfections. Yet, since land availability varies across villages, it may be necessary to approach the issue more cautiously. Some villages are so poorly endowed in land that there is a need to develop alternative employment activities alongside land reform measuresthe proposal calling for consolidation of holdings in the new land policy is a step in the right direction, but area consolidation through integrated farming schemes need to be reconsidered in light of the potential incentive problems they may createthere is room to increase land productivity by improving the working of the labour market and enhancing access to credit without even having to change the existing tenure system considerablyshare tenancy should be considered as an acceptable contract form in the land market as it allows the sharing of risk and a way out of imperfection in the labour and capital markets ;M.

eldis:A73079;Mining value chains and green growth in South Africa: A conflictual but intertwined relationship;;"The development of mining value chains is conflictual but deeply intertwined with the goal of sustainable development.  The response of mining value chains to the shift to a green economy cannot be business-as-usual and requires a proactive answer by business, Government, labour, non-governmental organisations and the research community in support of sustainable development. The transition to a green economy will not fundamentally challenge the central position of mining value chains in South Africa’s development path. The development of green industries and services will generate considerable mining-related opportunities, which South Africa is ideally placed to seize. The shift to a green economy will nevertheless structurally affect both the demand for mineral-based products, i.e. what to produce, and the means of providing them, i.e. how to produce. While many mining and manufacturing companies are already vigorously investing in the green economy, most prospects on both the supply and demand side remain underexploited or untapped.

This Working Paper builds on a research project on the impact of electricity price increases on the competitiveness of selected mining sector and smelting value chains in South Africa, carried out with the Global Green Growth Institute for the Economic Development Department and the Department of Trade and Industry of the Republic of South Africa.

Key policy recommendations:


	a comprehensive strategic and integrated planning for the sustainable development of South Africa’s natural resources should be developed
	institutional and legal confusion around environmental regulations should be addressed while environmental and social ‘licences to operate’ should be adequately enforced
	the use of renewable energy and cogeneration and the improvement of resource efficiency, particularly in the area of energy and water, should be accelerated and further supported
	the interplay between industrial development, trade and green economy in South Africa should be better understood, particularly in terms of potential risks and opportunities

This calls for direct interplay between donor assistance and the private sector (farmers, processors, traders) through intensive use of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Cooperatives to enhance domestic capacity of businesses to address problems which they face. In working towards effective and equitable economic growth, it is necessary to increase black ownership and investment at all levels of the economy. Given the major role of the agriculture sector in the NCAs, it is suggested that black empowerment in the agribusiness sector may be a logical start for the indigenization of the economy. ;E.T.

eldis:A71252;A promise betrayed: policies and practice penew the rural dispossession of land, rights and prospects;;"South Africans assumed on 27 April 1994 that their vote for freedom would erase the ethnic enclaves known as ‘Bantustans’ or ‘homelands’ and guarantee a common citizenship with equal rights under one law. Officially, the 10 homelands were dismantled under the interim constitution that introduced democracy in 1994, paving the way for the reversal of the dispossession that had been entrenched by the 1913 and 1936 land acts. Instead, 20 years later, a series of laws, bills and policies proposes a separate legal regime for people within the boundaries of those former Bantustans. The effect is to consolidate the unilateral authority of chiefs in relation to land ownership and to deny other rural South Africans the right to decide for themselves how to use and share the newly discovered mineral wealth of the land they have owned and occupied for centuries.

This policy brief argues for the following:


	national and provincial policy and legislation should remove superimposed tribal boundaries based on the architecture of apartheid and allow people to define their own identities. Customary
	law must be recognised as consensual
	the Department of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform should facilitate independent research to clarify the historical and customary entitlements of different groups. This would lead to more nuanced mining agreements reflecting the consent of those with specific interests in particular areas of land
	the provisions of the Interim Protection of Informal Land Right Act of 1996 must be actively enforced by the state
	the state needs to intervene in litigation by traditional leaders to uphold the right to tenure security set out in s25(6) of the Constitution and prevent threats to the basic land rights of poor people

The city has been identified as one of the 15 most climate change vulnerable cities of the world. This study was conducted to assess how urban and peri-urban residents of Khulna have been affected by the Mayur River through its use and abuse, and to explore adaptation measures. To complete the study, primary data was collected through field surveys, stakeholders' consultation, focused group discussion, key informantinterview and water quality analysis. Result shows that the Mayur plays a very important role by meeting the agricultural water demand; domestic water demand and water demand for capture and culture of fisheries for livelihoods. However, urban residents use the river as a dumping site for discharging solid waste. River encroachment through various means and practices is also a regular event. Analysis of salinity and tidal water level indicates that salinity intrusion would further increase due to sea level rise induced by climate change. Water and wastewater quality reveals that the river water is extremely polluted to support aquatic life and livelihood services.Physico-chemical parameters, DO, EC, TDS, Na+, Mg2+, PO43- and salinity exceed the recommended limits for drinking and irrigation set by the DoE and WHO. These overall situations often initiate water use conflicts. Finally, we discussed the current water management practices and adaptation for long term management of the Mayur.

Remaining fish and wildlife resource should be managed in conjunction with agriculture ,  protection of habitats in parks and reserves, creative use of resources in those protected areas, and ecotourism so that the greatest sustainable benefits for the human population can be attained in the future.

eldis:A8615;Healing the scars? Tracing links between environment, food and conflict in Africa;;A University of Leeds collaborative study has probed links between environmental change and famine – two problems perceived to lie at the heart of Africa’s current crisis – in the context of another all too often linked to the continent - warfare and civil unrest. Land hunger and environmental depletion in the aftermath of war are often cited as causes of famine that in turn will lead to further conflict. Is such a chain reaction really at work? Is there an inevitable causal link between environmental degradation and violent conflict? ;"Lionel Cliffe

Using ethnographic and participatory approaches, it documents the people's lived experience of a changing climate and water insecurity. While urbanization and climate variability alter the availability of water, the effects of this are aggravated by a complex interaction of caste, class, gender and locational factors. The most vulnerable are those whose identities are constructed at the intersection of these factors. The paper then describes the wide range of social, economic and institutional factors that shape the periurban residents' adaptive strategies. ;"P. Ranjan

eldis:A27858;The Impact of Globalization on Pre-Industrial, Technologically Quiescent Economies: Real Wages, Relative Factor Prices and    Commodity Price Convergence in the Third World Before 1940;;Paper uses a new pre-1940 Third World data base documenting real wages and relative factor prices to explore their determinants. There are three possibilities: external price shocks, factor endowment changes,  and technological change. As the paper's title suggests, technological change is an unlikely explanation.       The paper lays out an explicit econometric agenda for the future, although more casual empiricism suggests that external price shocks were doing most of the work, and declining-transport-cost-induced commodity price convergence in particular. Real wages in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America never showed any  signs of catching up with the European industrial leaders prior to 1914 hold their own. The ratio of wages to  land rents, on the other hand, declined up to World War I and so did the ratio of wages to GDP per capita. The trend reversed thereafter. These relative factor price movements help sharpen our understanding of the  sources of growth (or lack of it) in Asia and Latin America prior to 1940. They also offer strong hints about changes in income distribution there.

eldis:A73170;The nexus of oil, conflict, and climate change vulnerability of pastoral communities in Northwest Kenya;;"This paper focuses on pastoralism in the country of Turkana in northwest Kenya.

It highlights that an increase in drought frequency associated with global climate change and intensifying violent conflicts between pastoral groups, poses significant challenges for local communities. It points out that significant oil reserves have been discovered in the region which may compound the problem.

The paper aims to analyse how the oil exploration affects the communities’ vulnerability to climate change. Secondly, the paper explores the risk of 10 the oil explorations to create new conflicts or aggravate existing ones.

The findings are taken to suggest that the oil exploration increases the community’s vulnerability to climate change. Further, the paper argues, unmet community expectations for water, employment and development pose a significant risk for violent conflict between local communities and the operating oil company. Intercommunal conflict over water and 20 land could increase as well.

eldis:A23410;The global drylands imperative: pastoralism and mobility in the drylands;;"This document outlines the necessity of formulating development policies specifically targeted at pastoralists and their livelihoods.  The author reports that pastoralists have generally been ill-served by development policies and actions because of myths suggesting that pastoralists were 'backward'.  Previous policies focused on changing pastoralists into something more ‘modern' or progressive.  Fortunately, many of these policies are now changing and consider ways to flexibly develop policies that address the needs of pastoralists.Some of the myths and misunderstandings that informed previous development policies towards pastoralists include:nomadic pastoralism is an archaic form of production, whose time has passedmobility is inherently backward, unnecessary, chaotic and disruptivepastoralists do not take care of the land because of the 'tragedy of the commons'pastoralists contribute little to national economic activitypastoralism is a very low productive system. Sedentary cattle raising is more productive than mobile systemspastoralists need to settle to benefit from servicesThe authors suggest that a more realistic vision of future pastoralism envisages a flourishing economy, with well-educated and successful pastoral producers, no longer marginalised from mainstream society. In order to fulfil this, new policies need to address:the basic structure of the pastoral economy: a ranching model will not be successfulpastoral population growth: in many cases an overflow channel for herders who want to leave pastoralism is needed, so that pastoral populations can regain flexibility in relation to the natural resources that sustain them; also important is the diversification and processing or production of secondary products within pastoralist areasmanaging land use and natural resources to give priority to pastoralism where that is justifiedimproving natural resource tenure to remove present ambiguities and strengthen corporate

These inlcude:development of these lands must take a form more suitable to the sociological, political and ecological system to which these areas are best adaptedconventional range management techniques known to work elsewhere have had no success owing to unreliable and erratic rainfall with consequent irregular forage production. This means that in most cases it is not possible to devise a definite and regularly prescribed grazing rotationmany development plans are illsuited to peoples needs, and are therefore rejected. An example would be where development programmes emphasise cattle production in areas where camels and small stock are environmentally the best adapted speciesany developmental and environmental programme which seeks the welfare of the local pastoralists must first of all strengthen the present pastoral economy. Once the pastoral economy has been placed on a firmer and less vulnerable basis there is no reason why it cannot produce a surplus of livestock and meat for the wider economy as well as enriching the local communitydevelopment plans designed for marginal lands must also have provision for drought yearspastoralists should sell off stock rapidly when drought threatens.  his has two aspects. First, pastoralists should be encouraged to sell mature male stock in good years and to save money so earned in savings accounts (where such facilities are available) for use in drought years.

eldis:A23823;Land rights reform and governance in Africa;;"The main argument of this paper is that insecurity of land tenure is a socio-political condition that can be made and unmade. This discussion paper focuses on customary land rights, particularly in the African context. The paper reveals that:

    land tenure policies in the 19th and 20th century failed to recognise indigenous property rights derived through customary occupancy
    these policies have deprived millions of poor of the protection they need to withstand the worst effects of social transformation and the commoditisation of land
    20th century reforms often improved the access of poor to land through land redistribution and other schemes but made customary rights less secure
    in Africa over 90 percent of the rural population access to land through indigenous customary mechanisms, and around 370 million of them are definably ""poor""
    while rights over farms and houses are not routinely interfered with, common property ownership of pastures, forests and woodlands see constant attrition through state appropriation and reallocation to investors or interest-holders of its choice
    the lucrative and rising values of pasture, forest and woodland are still typically captured by governments in the form of logging, agribusiness land leasing and other fees depriving poor communities of a crucial capital base which could help them escape poverty.

The paper indicates that there are a small but growing number of cases in Africa, where customary rights are now accorded equivalent legal force with those acquired through non-indigenous systems and may be registered under state law. Pointing to the need for a more action-based and community driven process, the author argues that this will:

    better resolve conceptual confusions that still surround customary tenure and which frustrate sound policy development
    trigger the local level empowerment and institution-building needed to more appropriately shape, drive and sustain political will towards real removal of the chronic tenure insecurity of the poor
    limit the impacts of reform that is broadly market-driven and in the African context, often seeks more to bring as much customary land into the market place for investor acquisition than to secure customary rights and benefits
    bring threatened commons to the centre of reform, facilitating the evolution of stronger constructs for the ordering and protection of collective rights.

eldis:A20074;How Dutch public money is used to finance the oil industry;;"This report investigates how Dutch public money is being used to support oil production in developing countries through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs). It notes that the Dutch government contributes to MDBs in two ways: through financial contributions using public money and by voting on the boards of the banks.Three case studies demonstrate that recent oil projects financed by the Dutch government and MDBs are failing the poor. They are: the Chad- Cameroon Pipeline in West Africa; the Baku-T’bilisi-Ceyhan pipeline system in the South Caucasus and the Sakhalin-II Oil and Gas Project in far eastern Russia.. The report argues that if the Dutch government is to achieve its goals on development cooperation and on addressing climate change it must cease supporting oil projects in developing countries and support renewable and sustainable energy projects.The report covers the following areas:the development goals of International Financial Institutions and the west’s dependency on oilthe local, regional and global impacts of oil developmentcase studiesenergy securityopportunities for change It concludes:internal divisons within the Dutch government with regard to extractive industry policies need to be addressedthe Dutch Government  needs a clear policy on support for oil development, and on how this relates to climate change mitigationthe urgent problem of climate change and for a long-term national energy policy that encompasses the impact of oil dependence on developing countries and the global imperative for a clear strategy for moving towards alternatives to oilThe report recommends that:the Dutch Government should phase out over a limited timeframe, all public funding for the oil industryDutch participation in MDBs should be in

By analysing why, until recently, the Ilemi has been ‘unwanted’ and hence not economically developed by any regional government, the article aims to historically elucidate differences of perception and significance of the area between the authorities and the local herders.  This article places the disputed ‘triangle’ of conflict into historical, anthropological, sociological and political context.The article concludes by assessing the future of the dispute in view of the current initiative by the USA to end the 19-year-old civil war in Sudan and promote the country’s relationship with her neighbours particularly Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. However, the author is cynical of attempts to enhance international security and political stability that do not embrace ‘peoples of the periphery’, such as the herders of Ilemi, into the economic, social, and political rhythm of the mainstream society. ;N Mburu;;African Studies Quarterly;eldis;01/01/2003;en;pastoralists;;;202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12703;http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v7/v1i1.PDF/v7i1a2.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.africa.ufl.edu%2Fasq%2Fv7%2Fv1i1.PDF%2Fv7i1a2.pdf;;;;"Horn of Africa;pastoral;Human rights in conflict and security;Animal production and health;Participation;ilemi;Africa;pastoralism conflict;Governance;Agriculture and food;ilemi triangle;Pastoralism perception and visibility;Pastoralism representation;conflict;Conflict and security;pastoralism;pastoralism and conflict;Pastoralism;participation"
eldis:A36050;New agricultural frontiers in post-conflict Sierra Leone? Exploring institutional challenges for wetland management in the Eastern Province;;"Sierra Leone has recently emerged from a long period of political instability and civil war, and is ranked among the world’s poorest countries. Thousands of displaced people are in the process of returning totheir villages to rebuild their mainly farming-based livelihoods, and many are growing food crops for the first time in a decade. Drawing on recent fieldwork carried out in two rural communities in the Eastern Province, Kayima (Kono District) and Panguma (Kenema District), this paper considers how institutional arrangements function in Sierra Leone’s swamp wetlands and explores how stresses associated with a post-conflict environment are shaping land-use decisions and mediating access to resources in new ways. With pressure on food production increasing in rural areas, the inland valley swamps in particular, have been identified by the government as a vital resource for sustaining rural livelihoods and achieving food security through the production of rice and other commodities. However, previous government policies directed at enhanced wetland production have largely failed to achieve their goals, and have been criticised for neglecting the institutional challenges of development. The findings of the enquiry, the author asserts, have implications for Sierra Leone’s recently adopted commitment to decentralisation, a move that has, in theory, seen the state strengthen its position at the local level, and will allegedly create new spaces for increased interaction between state agencies, traditional leaders and communities. The author argues that two institutional challenges must be addressed - access to land and access to water - if decentralised reforms to resource management are to be effective for wetland rice production. The analysis concludes by considering one recent initiative at the forefront of efforts to decentralise the Ministry of Agriculture, the ‘Agricultural Business Unit’ (ABU) initiative, to elucidate some of the challenges faced in post-conflict wetland rehabilitation. It notes that: 

    local interests in rural society are embedded in unequal social relationships in far-reaching ways. As such, readdressing these tensions remains central to achieve the benefits of decentralisation
     the creation of democratic, accountable institutions at all scales will be essential not only in making rice wetland production more effective but also for achieving food security and keeping the country on track for sustainable development in the years to come
    the possibility of a return to pre-war systems of patrimonialism remains one of the greatest threats to derailing the recovery process and subverting its potential benefits in the countryside.

eldis:A72094;Oil, corruption and conflict in West Africa: The failure of governance and corporate social responsibility;;"Natural resources are a noted cause of intra-state conflict and deserve recognition as such by ECOWAS. Oil, in particular, is linked to frequent civil strife and conflicts induced by slow rates of economic growth, weak and undemocratic governments, rampant corruption and heavy militarization. Many African countries have already suffered the negative consequences of an oil-dependency, including Angola, which endured a brutal civil war that lasted for more than a quarter-century. Recent new discoveries of oil in West Africa have made the region a high priority for investment by International Oil Companies (IOC’s), especially since governments such as the United States have begun to regard West African oil production as an alternative to reliance on oil exports from Middle East.  Unless a concerted effort is made to change the nature of the industry, the hope that the abundance of oil in West Africa will foster significant poverty reduction will come to knot.

The aim of this monograph is to examine the correlation between corporate behavior and an increased potential for conflict in oil-producing countries. The study asserts that IOCs can and must change their way of doing business, and that by working cooperatively with the international and advocacy communities, that change will reduce or even eliminate conflicts and other maladies of resource-rich West African countries. The scope of this study includes oil producers in the Gulf of Guinea, particularly West Africa, but also includes Angola and newcomer Equatorial Guinea.

In conclusion, the author suggests that relevant elements of the Conflict Prevention Mechanism, including the Executive Secretariat, should strive to achieve a balance between the aims and interests of NGO’s, the international community, governments, indigenous communities, the IOC’s and private sector contractors. This is admittedly easier said than done, but for West Africans to benefit economically from extractive activities on their soil there must be a collective responsibility for that outcome, to be addressed as a regional priority, if future conflicts are to be avoided.

eldis:A70503;Win win partnership? China, Southern Africa and extractive industries;;"The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has prioritised Africa as a strategic partner at both the political and economic levels. According to some observers, the evidence of China’s growing African involvement suggests a strategy devised to secure access to the continent’s abundant resources.

Through a combination of soft power, tactical incentives, strategic investment and political collaboration. Observers declare Chinese interventions particularly troubling where they appear to (inadvertently or by design) support authoritarian regimes, hinder economic development, promote conflict and allow human rights abuses.

Africa’s dynamic relationship with China offers many new possibilities and potential advantages, but the form and content of this relationship should be shaped by Africans.

However, appropriate and effective policy responses (from both China and Africa) are required to ensure a mutually beneficial China-Africa relationship, particularly in relation to the most critical sector – natural resources. This study investigates the China-Africa relationship in relation to the extraction of natural resources across southern Africa and suggests policy options and dialogue processes that would help to create a more positive relationship and support mutual economic development.

In this context, policy options and dialogue processes become critical in advancing the interests of southern Africa’s economic development, human security and democratisation in the face of new challenges. The process of ensuring a win-win relationship with China should include the following:


	building and maintaining an efficient and effective mining public administration;
	developing the competencies to run the extractive industries;
	strengthening tax regimes;
	building linkages between the extractive industries and local economies;
	using China’s massive finances to support regional infrastructure development; and
	ensuring that Chinese companies are no longer let off the hook regarding corporate social responsibilities.


Ineffective governance and commercial regulation will inevitably allow for a poor result from any foreign involvement option. Southern African nations need to be more steadfast in pursuing their national interests and achieving their long-term goals. ";"G. Shelton

eldis:A75625;DAR, land reform-related agencies and the CARP: A study of government and alternative approaches to land acquisition and distribution;;"This study examines the land acquisition and distribution process of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) by analyzing the nature and extent of participation of the various government agencies. Attempts are also made in identifying the areas where land reform can be hastened. While there are opportunities for change, the paper concludes that the overall impact of these changes on land reform may not be as large in terms of area coverage. Generally, there are many agencies involved in land reform, many documents required and many check and balance systems have been instituted that tend to prolong the land acquisition process.

eldis:A8593;Conflict to consensus: replacing rivalry with effective resource management in Burkina Faso;;For over a hundred years the zone of Kisha Beiga, in Burkina Faso, was plagued by ethnic conflicts, revolution and political anarchy. Local rivalries and administrative chaos put paid to any efforts to manage natural resources efficiently. Then, in 1991, the Burkinabe Sahel Programme (PSB) set out to quell factional rivalry and establish sustainable resource-management in the area. A fragile consensus has been achieved, but it has not been easy. Leadership conflicts, land tenure issues and administrative anomalies have threatened to derail the project. This PSB-GTZ case-study traces the history of the PSB from its inception, examining the early setbacks, their subsequent resolution, and the current balance of interests in the zone. ;"Matthias Banzhaf

eldis:A69583;Impact of fertilizer use on weed management in conservation agriculture - a review;;"Intensive farming has been adopted to produce large amounts of food grains and cash crops but environment is being deteriorated at alarming rate also. Increased use of fertilizers, pesticides, chemical growth regulators, machinery and poor management practices are accelerating environmental pollution, soil degradation, global warming, climatic change and food deterioration. Conservation agriculture offers a sustainable solution for all these problems most often. This review focuses the use of fertilizers in conservation agriculture and their impact on weed management. Weeds are major constraint in the productivity of agro-ecosystems. Fertilizer use can influence weed emergence, weed persistence, weed dormancy, weed dynamics, weed growth and weed dispersion attributes. The rate, timing, type and method of fertilizer application affect biological trends of weeds. In conservation tillage systems, the interaction between fertilizers and weeds is very complex, and there are reports of positive as well as negative correlations with weed establishment. Altered physical and chemical properties of reduced-tillage soils result in different weed growth and weed-crop competition periods and thus have indirect impacts on weed control strategies and management options in conservation crop production.

eldis:A69581;Improving land sector governance in South Africa implementation of the land governance assessment framework;;"Land governance and administration are critical for achieving economic growth and development in any country. It is within this context that the World Bank introduced the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) for identifying specific areas for land reform while also providing a means for monitoring. 
This report serves as the country report for South Africa. It provides an outline of the process, background information on the country, an assessment of land governance and the concomitant policy analysis, recommendations and conclusions. The report is intended to be a resource document for government and other land practitioners within the non-governmental and private sectors to guide policy development and interventions within the land sector. 
In South Africa, the application of the LGAF has been challenging due to its economy (including a formal land market) and informal systems in communal land areas. However, the application of the LGAF within the South African context was useful in providing a “snap shot” of the state of land governance in the country. It managed to expose the obvious successes and failures and the sophistication and the lack thereof within the current system. The duality of land governance that is the formal in juxtaposition to the informal was demonstrated through the use of the methodology, which assessed land governance in the following themes:

    land tenure
    urban land use planning and development
    rural land use and land policy
    land valuation and taxation
    public land management
    public provision of land information
    dispute resolution
    large scale land acquisition 

 The report recommends further examination of the following areas:

    time based on large scale land acquisition within the African sub region
    the preparation of a methodology and tools for supporting municipalities in the implementation of an incremental tenure approach
    the determination of a possible legal framework for supporting the implementation of an incremental tenure approach
    support with the drafting of suitable legislation for enforcing communal land rights

eldis:A75558;Land accumulation dynamics in developing country agriculture;;"Understanding land accumulation dynamics is relevant for policymakers interested in the economic effects of land inequality in developing country agriculture. This Working Paper explores and simultaneously tests the leading theories of microlevel land accumulation dynamics using unique panel data from Paraguay. The results suggest that farm growth varies systematically with farm size – a formal rejection of stochastic growth theories (that is, Gibrat's Law) – and that titled land area may have considerable infuence on land accumulation. Furthermore, the authors' estimates indicate that a dualistic agrarian structure is the likely product of the unfettered operation of land markets.

eldis:A73983;Transboundary water governance and climate change adaptation;;"As climate variability increases, so does the cost of the infrastructure, information and systems needed to cope with it. The biggest impact of climate change in many sectors may well be an increase in the cost of water services.

In addition, approaches to water resource management have evolved over the past few decades following the acknowledgment that engineering solutions, while vitally important and an integral part of any future approach, cannot by themselves solve the world’s water problems.

The most important factors to be considered for climate change adaptation in the water context relate to a range of social, economic and political challenges that have to be addressed, and a variety of ‘soft’, legal and institutional instruments that can be deployed to complement infrastructural solutions.

Experiences from river basins around the world provide numerous examples of ways in which the measures described in this report have been adopted and implemented.

Addressing these complex and often interrelated challenges requires consideration of a whole host of social, cultural, economic, environmental, legal and political factors.

However, for the purposes of this report, only the governance-related aspects have been considered. While these governance-related aspects are crucial to the development of climate change adaptation measures, they should, the authors maintain, not be considered in isolation. The main governance aspects they take into consideration are the following:


	Adopting ecosystem-based approaches to water management strategies.
	Strengthening institutions in order to facilitate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation.
	Coherent legal and regulatory frameworks.
	Investment in water governance capacity is critical

It argues that the land-use sector serves key environmental and social functions and supports the livelihoods of around a half of the world’s population. However, it is argued that the climate regime fails to formulate a coherent vision or set of incentives for mitigation and adaptation from the sector. The negotiation of a future climate treaty that will take effect in 2020 is seen as a key opportunity to improve the current system and create an integrated accounting and incentive framework for adaptation and mitigation strategies across all land-uses.

eldis:A44123;Rising temperatures, rising tension: climate change and the risk of violent conflict in the Middle East;;"Climate models are predicting a hotter, drier and less predictable climate in the Middle East, a region already considered the world's most water-scarce and where, in many places, demand for water already outstrips supply. This report addresses the links between climate change, peace and conflict.
It finds that the legacy of conflict in the region undermines the ability of countries and communities to adapt to climate change. The history of hostility and mistrust greatly complicates efforts to collaborate over shared resources, to invest in more efficient water and energy use, to share new ways to adapt to climate change and to pursue truly multilateral action on climate change. Ultimately, climate change presents an even more serious challenge than it would otherwise. 
The report goes on to assert that climate change itself poses real security concerns to the region such as: 

    increased competition for scarce water resources, complicating peace agreements 
    intensified food insecurity, thereby raising the stakes for the return or retention of occupied land 
    hindering economic growth, worsening poverty and social instability 
    destabilisation could lead to forced migration and increased tensions over refugee populations 
    increased militarisation of strategic natural resources 
    growing resentment and distrust of the West (as a result of perceived inertia). 

Nevertheless there is much that national governments and authorities, civil society and the international community can do address the challenge of climate change, and in so doing, address some of the threats it may pose to regional peace and security. They can promote a culture of conservation in the region, help communities and countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and foster greater cooperation on their shared resources.

eldis:A69905;Gender and land reforms in Pakistan;;"Women’s land ownership and control have important connections with their empowerment in Pakistan’s agricultural context. However, the link between these has largely remained unexplored; and there has been negligible research to determine how many women own or control land in Pakistan. The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) carried out a multiple pronged research in 2007-09 to fill this knowledge gap and to examine the causality behind women’s land ownership and empowerment. The research focused on women’s rights vis-à-vis the inheritance framework of private agrarian land; and did not encompass private residential or commercial property, neither did it cover other possible means of land acquisition by women like through purchase or as gifts.

The research spanned rural areas across all four provinces of Pakistan, drawing on national laws, existing policies, literature review and field work. The qualitative data was gathered through interviews, surveys, focus group discussions, life histories, narratives and case studies.

This Policy Paper briefly traces the chronological evolution of land organization to examine the context, direction and underlying objectives of state-led land reforms in Pakistan. It does so with a specific focus on the interface of land politics and gender relations, with the understanding that land, among other resources, has been one of the key components for maintaining patriarchal control of women; that rural women’s lives are intimately connected to land, on which they are direct stakeholders.

The author observes that all the laws related to land reform had a built-in gender bias. The inaccessibility and complexity of the legal requirements and bureaucratic processes further diminished the chances of women claiming and acquiring whatever limited rights they were granted through legal reforms. In conclusion, the author is of the opinion that land reforms in the long term, (especially for women) must be accompanied by deeper structural transformations to achieve any significant change. ";N.

eldis:A73952;Mineral rights, rents and resources in South Africa’s development narrative;;South Africa is endowed with substantial subsoil mineral wealth, yet the development promise typically associated with this wealth has not been realised. Between 2001 and 2008 the South African mining industry contracted at a rate of 1% a year, while comparable mining jurisdictions grew at an average of 5% a year.1 This period marked the longest commodity price boom in recent history. South Africa’s failure to capitalise on the boom provides a clue to the country’s puzzling post-1994 economic and political development.This paper explores potential explanations for South Africa’s economic underperformance since 1994. Despite the country’s substantial subsoil mineral wealth endowment, the development promise typically associated with such wealth has not been realised. The democratic dividend has produced some level of macroeconomic stability, but large fault lines have emerged, especially since the 2008 financial crisis.The paper examines whether ‘Dutch disease’ explanations can account for weak manufacturing performance, but finds that they are inadequate. Given mining’s continued importance to the economy, the paper explores whether mineral resources could be better leveraged for inclusive development. It concludes that more coherent institutional choices are required if this is to come to fruition. Currently, the mineral rights regime, traditional leadership legislation and industrial policy are not sufficiently integrated to give effect to the ambitions of the National Development Plan as they pertain to the potential contribution of mining to the economy. Mineral rents could provide the impetus for upstream technology and product development, but the mining industry first has to generate growth.Beyond mining, economically inefficient visa regulations, electricity shortages and a general lack of policy clarity all contribute to South Africa’s weak economic performance. Addressing these factors would attract the growth-inducing investment required for sustained and inclusive economic growth. ;R.

eldis:A61430;Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils;;"This report aims to improve the knowledge base for scaling-up investments in land management technologies that sequester soil carbon for increased productivity under changing climate conditions. The report presents the following key messages.

    Sustainable land management technologies can benefit farmers, because they can increase yields and reduce production costs.
    Soil carbon sequestration can be maximised by managing trade-offs across space, time and sectors.
    Adoption of sustainable land management practices is affected by socio-economic and institutional barriers.
    Without public support for farmers, poor agricultural land management increases land degradation, farmers’ vulnerability to climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The publication reports that sustainable land management delivers carbon benefits in the following ways:

    carbon conservation, in which the large volumes of carbon stored in natural habitats remain stored as carbon stocks
    carbon sequestration, in which the growth of agricultural and natural biomass removes carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in soil and biomass
    sustainable land management (SLM), in which carbon stocks become carbon sources as agricultural production expands into natural ecosystems.

On factors affecting soil carbon sequestration, the paper shows that:

    climate significantly influences large-scale patterns of soil carbon sequestration; sites in warmer and middle temperature regions accumulate soil carbon more rapidly than those in colder regions, while semi-humid areas have higher sequestration rates than semi-arid areas
    soil type is significant to soil carbon sequestration, because soils with higher clay content sequester carbon at higher rates
    timing requires careful consideration when introducing improved land management practices that increase carbon sequestration.

The paper recommends the following policy options for soil carbon sequestration.

    Strengthen the capacity of governments to implement climate smart agriculture.
    Integrate agriculture into the ongoing negotiations for an international climate change regime.
    Boost financial support for early action through a combination of public, private and development finance to scale-up improved land management practices to support food security.
    Raise the level of national investment in agriculture through selective targeting and prioritisation of technologies that generate long-term returns.

eldis:A61725;Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies in Nepal's Forest Sector: How can rural Communities benefit?;;"This paper outlines options for rural communities to participate in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities in the forest sector in Nepal. It looks at the various institutional barriers that would need to be overcome, as well as the existing institutional opportunities, particularly in relation to tenure rights, both for mitigation (Clean Development Mechanism projects and REDD+) as well as for adaptation action. It also presents several forest-based strategies practised by rural communities in Nepal, and the role of communities related to deforestation and conservation of forests.

The study is part of a series of case studies looking at the governance of climate change mitigation and adaptation in the forestry sector in Bolivia, Mali and Nepal. ";"P. Bharat

eldis:A69831;Packaging township development projects;;"There are no simple solutions for leveraging the project inputs required for the success of township development projects. In most cases, such projects require long planning and implementation periods, the involvement of numerous agencies, and ample persistence and skill. This paper will examines how the inputs for successful township development projects can be mobilised and managed through the course of a project.

The study observes that the  required inputs will be sourced from the municipality, provincial and national departments, and the private sector including non-profit groups). The distribution of inputs between institutions in these three sectors often pose the biggest challenge to township project managers. In most urban renewal environments, including townships, the majority of physical development projects require public-sector intervention in parallel to private investment. So, for example, studies of the successful URP anchor projects (DPLG 2009) demonstrate the success of interventions where the municipality assembles the land input and secures the requisite statutory approvals; as public and municipal capital investment in facilities and the public environment starts the investment ball rolling, this attracts additional private-sector investment, which, in turn, creates opportunities for smaller-scale private investment.

The study identifies a set of intervention strategies that target the physical transformation of township environments. Any physical intervention project – be it the establishment of a node, an activity spine or improving an open space system – need four inputs to be mobilised and applied:

1. Land

2. Capital

3. Human resources and skills

4. Statutory approvals and authorisations

To secure these inputs, a fifth condition is required: leadership. Someone needs to drive the complex processes of mobilising and applying these inputs. This is generally the function of the project manager. This paper is therefore written to help project managers/township renewal practitioners explore the processes of mobilising and applying the necessary requirements for success.

The paper conclude by stating that at the centre of all the successful case studies is a project manager, frequently  supported by a project team, committed to seeing the project through to the end. If such leadership cannot be secured, the project will probably fail and should not even be attempted.

eldis:A73989;Can carbon (SOC) offset the climate change;;"The paper reviews research showing that soils contain more carbon than atmosphere and all plant life combined, noting that increasing carbon storage in soils is relatively simple compared to approaches to use geoengineering to avert climate change.

The paper describes the key findings of the 2015 FAO Status of the World's Soil Resources Report (SWSR) launched in December 2015, including: conversion of forests, pastures and grasslands can lead to a loss of 25 to 35% of SOC; soil sealing can greatly reduce SOC; and an enduring increase in SOC content in soils requires a proportional increase in nitrogen, phosphorous and several other nutrients. The SWSR report also finds that most of the world's soils are in poor or fair condition and deteriorating.

The paper concludes that appropriate land use systems have the potential to sequester significant amounts of carbon while also decreasing soil erosion, maintaining soil organic matter, augmenting nitrogen buildup, and promoting efficient nutrient cycling. The paper notes, however that the effect of land use and soil management on different soil types under varying local climates needs to be better understood.

eldis:A40698;MEAs, conservation and conflict. A case study of Virunga National Park, DRC;;"Focusing on the case of Virunga National Park (PNVi) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this paper looks at Multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and the impact of ongoing conflict. It also discusses opportunities for elevating environment-conflict issues to international policy levels to help save important ecosystems in times of conflict. It is explained that for the past two decades, the park and the surrounding area in North Kivu province have experienced near-constant violent conflict. For the local population, the result has been widespread suffering: death, rape, displacement, sickness and starvation. Beyond the humanitarian crisis, conflict has threatened the species, habitats and communities that depend on PNVi for their survival. The park is in crisis: its governance system has collapsed; its boundaries are encroached upon by the surrounding local and refugee populations; its habitats are being destroyed by overfishing and charcoal production; and its animals are killed for meat and ivory. Multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), designed to protect such globally-significant ecosystems, have so far been unable to address the threats to the park. Despite the proliferation of relevant environmental conventions and the DRC’s participation in them, environmental destruction continues in PNVi. UN MEAs provide opportunities for elevating environment-conflict issues to international policy levels. Although UN MEAs are not designed or expected to offer practical solutions to conservation crises on the ground, they do build capacity, improve information gathering  and support underfunded budgets. Some of the UN MEAs being initiated in DRC include: 

    the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) - field consultations indicate that the CBD is not seen as a particularly strong tool for the promotion of transboundary cooperation. But improved action on transboundary natural resource management in the region, supported by the Convention, could help park authorities on all sides of the border deal with some of the impacts of conflict on the various components of the shared ecosystem 
    the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species has proven to be an important catalyst for deepening transboundary cooperation among the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. Key lessons include the importance of forging agreements at the level closest to the environment-conflict challenge in question and the need for robust cooperative mechanisms to address conservation challenges that no one range state could address alone
    the Wetlands Protection Convention could provide much-needed resources for the DRC in the protection of its Ramsar sites. Ramsar could be an important catalyst for strengthening transboundary cooperation in order to mitigate the environmental impacts of conflict in the region, specifically relating to the Lake Edward ecosystem.

The paper concludes by highlighting other international and African policy instruments and forums, which are equally important alongside the MEA-specific entry points. These provide immediate opportunities for the DRC to raise environmental conflict concerns. ";"A. Crawford

eldis:A26284;From Dutch disease to deforestation - a  macroeconomic link? A case study from Ecuador;;"In the literature about macroeconomics and deforestation, it is often supposed that strong foreign exchange outflows (e.g. debt service) increase deforestation, as higher poverty augments frontier migration and natural resources are squeezed to generate export revenues. This paper analyses the opposite phenomenon, i.e. the deforestation impact of  substantial foreign exchange inflows, which is analysed in the ""Dutch Disease"" macroeconomics literature. This framework is applied to Ecuador, which from 1974 to 1982 faced a foreign exchange boom from oil exports and foreign borrowing, and then compared to the somewhat scattered data on Ecuadorean deforestation. The results do not support the initial hypothesis of 'more foreign exchange - less deforestation'; it is more likely that deforestation increased during the boom. Oil production facilitated new colonization; road construction programmes heavily spurred deforestation; soaring     budgets of development agencies facilitated cattle expansion. Factors that worked in the opposite direction (such as higher rural-urban migration, competitiveness loss in
land-extensive agriculture, and more money available for forest conservation) were insufficient to reverse the picture. As an overall conclusion, the Ecuadorean case reveals a complexity of links from macroeconomics to sectoral growth and deforestation, in particular because of the catalytical role of economic policies: With the Ecuadorean state's explicit strategy of infrastructural and agricultural expansion financed by oil revenues, the boom could not possibly lead to reduced deforestation. This implies that no      easy conclusions can be drawn from the external and macroeconomic framework to deforestation: Much depends on the specific sectoral structure and on domestic policy responses.

eldis:A21833;A solution to desertification: holistic resource management;;It is clear from the failure of our efforts in many countries to halt the desertification process - deserts are now advancing at a rate of nearly 15,000,000 acres a year worldwide (Worrall 1984) (that something was missing in our knowledge of the problem). Four discoveries have been made that enabled us to design a simple holistic model to manage resources successfully in a sustained and economic manner. Excellent results have now been achieved in many situations, and we have witnessed positive grassland improvement, even in a severe drought and under increased livestock stocking rates while protected plots in the same seasons have deteriorated (Cardon 1983, Savory 1984).HRM offers great hope for all resource management situations. The Center for Holistic Resource Management, a nonprofit membership organisation located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was formed by a group of resource managers, researchers, ranchers, farmers and environmentalists, to provide training and dissemination of knowledge on HRM. Working in an international collaborative effort, the Center now also acts as a focal point for the rapid increase in knowledge that is taking place through practical application of the HRM Model. ;A.

eldis:A27922;Private and communal property ownership regimes in Tanzania;;Tanzania’s well-known village establishment programme, which is called Ujamaa , allowed for the sedentarization of almost all rural residents in some 8 000 villages in the 1970s. The effective impact of villagization on land distribution may vary, but a general preference for individual assignments of rights has been observed in nearly all cases under study, which is at least partially due to the track record of communal production in the framework of Ujamaa . Only 6 percent of the country’s total surface is under cultivation. Therefore, common property management and open access to resources are an important part of all land tenure policy. Neither the privatization of rights nor the continuation of previous forms of common property permit forest and pastoral resources to be maintained under all circumstances, and are thus both inadequate. User groups must be identified and be assigned ownership of user rights, including the right and means to keep out trespassers. [author] ;"A.S. Kauzeni

eldis:A27923;Private and communal property rights in rangeland and forests in Uganda;;The present land tenure situation in Uganda is essentially the result of four factors: customary tenure practices, the mailo tenure system introduced under the British colonial administration, the Land Reform Decree passed by Idi Amin’s government in 1975, and the disrupting social order under the Amin regime and during the period following its downfall. The impacts of the Land Reform Decree and civil disobedience have led to the degradation of common property resources, particularly forest areas and pastures. Current policies in Uganda favour the privatization of property rights, including the permanent sedentarization of pastoral groups. To avoid any further weakening of the institutions that protect the natural resource bases, local communities and user groups, especially women and pastoralists, must be consulted and engaged in the formulation of policies.

eldis:A27920;Land access, off - farm income and capital access in relation to the reduction of rural poverty;;"The current framework of economic growth and development includes a general trend towards the privatization of land rights and a collapse of collective structures in agriculture as well as a move towards reliance on land markets as the means of peasant access to participation in the development process. Despite the removal of land reform as an explicit part of the policy agenda, it is clear that the situations which led to the activation of land reforms in past decades are still in place. This article discusses the relevance of looking at land tenure systems when evaluating macroeconomic policies that affect agriculture. Also discussed are the link between land tenure security and access to income and assets; the nature and performance of land markets with regard to the participation of the rural poor; and the link between agrarian organizational structures and off-farm income. The conclusion reached is that rural poverty reduction requires multifaceted policy efforts that recognize the linkages among household asset access portfolios, household income strategies and macrostructural changes.

eldis:A27921;After land reform, the market?;;The ultimately disappointing results of past redistributive reforms caused contemporary policy-makers in Latin America to search for alternatives. In recent years, the issue of transforming tenure structure through the market mechanism has moved into the spotlight. This paper argues that it is extremely helpful to approach the topic from an institutional perspective. The institution of property rights is central to the discussion. New questions emerge: How are transactions actually being carried out in the rural setting? What role do transaction costs and the corresponding institutions such as property rights play? What influence may externalities have? A meaningful analysis of how rural land markets work cannot be done in a conventional neoclassical scenario. The rural economic environment is characterized by imperfect markets, asymmetric information and uncertainty. In addition, economic behaviour is often guided by the intrinsic logic of the peasant farm which differs markedly from the way commercial agriculture operates. No one property rights regime is universally valid. A whole array of agricultural institutions emerges as a response to different and evolving economic parameters. The complexities of rural land markets have to be considered in the design of effective policies.

eldis:A100694;The impact of climate change, desertification and land degradation on the development prospects of landlocked developing countries;;"Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) are disadvantaged in a myriad of ways and they have special needs which require special attention. Challenges such as undiversified economies, vulnerability to climate change and climate variability, land degradation and desertification, among others, are undermining the economic potential of many LLDCs. This has been exacerbated by weak export base of many LLDCs centered on a few primary agricultural and/ or mineral commodities. Further, because of their physical location markedly characterized by lack of access to sea ports, LLDCs are popularly referred to as ""€œprisoners of geography""€. This leaves most LLDCs at a distinct disadvantage as they cannot compete in international trade markets. Added together, this has created a situation in which LLDCs are among the poorest of the poor. In order to address this specific challenge, the United Nations First International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Development Partners held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in 2003, adopted the Almaty Programme of Action (APoA) whose central thrust was to: Address the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries.This comprehensive global partnership programme was intended to address essential transit transport problems and facilitate trade for LLDCs. Under the resolution 66/214 of the United Nations General Assembly, a ten-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action was undertaken in November 2014 to take stock on the performance of LLDCs over the past decade and adopted the Vienna Programme of Action (VPoA). One lesson learnt during the implementation of the APoA is that gains and momentum made by the LLDCs can be subdued unless threats posed by climate change, land degradation and desertification are seriously addressed.This study, therefore, seeks to draw the attention of the international community, policy makers and development agencies to the severe impact that climate change, desertification and land degradation has on the economies of LLDCs. Despite their huge negative impact on LLDCs, these issues have not received the international attention and priority they deserve. This study seeks to identify LLDC's priority areas on climate change, land degradation and desertification that could be included in their new development agenda. In order to achieve this objective, the study: (a) provides a comprehensive review of the impact of climate change, desertification and land degradation on LLDCs, (b) reviews national, regional and international interventions which have been implemented in LLDCs; (c) identifies best practices, lessons learnt and emerging opportunities and (d) proffers recommendations for inclusion in a new development agenda for LLDCs which will assist them to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change, desertification and land degradation.Recommendations on priorities of LLDCs on climate change, desertification, land degradation and drought - what has emerged from this study is that there is an imperative need to give LLDCs special attention in as far as the issues of climate change, land degradation and desertification are concerned. Although these issues have generally attracted considerable attention of the global community, there is no special focus on LLDCs, yet these countries are among the worst affected. Based on this review, a number of lessons, priorities and recommendations are drawn which can help shape further policy debates and concrete future plans of action. It is important to build the resilience of LLDCs to withstand the impact; build their adaptive capacity; and mitigation capacity.

eldis:A70397;Social capital as obstacle to development: brokering land, norms, and trust in rural India;;"During the 1990s, powerful development institutions like the World Bank came to see the social networks and norms of the rural poor in developing countries as 'assets' to be tapped for poverty alleviation. Defined by Robert Putnam (1995:67) as 'features of social organisation such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit', social capital was proclaimed the 'missing link' in development (Grooetaert 1997). Its contribution to various types of development outcomes became the subject of practical experimentation and scholarly research. The animating hypothesis of this large research programme has been that social capital, as an asset adhering in villages, regions, or even nation-states, is good for both democracy and development.

Based on a study of how land brokers in rural Rajasthan mediate the arrival of a Special Economic Zone, this paper argues that theories of collective social capital cannot explain how networks, norms, and trust interact in a process of economic change. It then reconstructs Bourdieu's distinct theory of individual social capital by showing how better connected farmers are able to broker land and capture profits at the expense of fellow villagers—undermining trust, norms, and collective action. It argues that social capital is most plausibly seen as an aspect of class inequality that hinders inclusive development. ";M.

eldis:A27929;Entering the 21st Century: World Development Report 1999/2000;;"Localization—the growing economic and political power of cities, provinces, and other sub-national entities—will be one of the most important new trends in the 21st century. Together with accelerating globalization of the world economy, localization could revolutionize prospects for human development or it could lead to chaos and increased human suffering.Improved communications, transportation and falling trade barriers are not only making the world smaller they are also fueling the desire and providing the means for local communities to shape their own future. Faced with popular demands for greater self-determination, national governments from Africa to Latin America, and from Europe to South East Asia are devolving power to the local level—with mixed results.The first half of the report focuses on three areas in which global cooperation is becoming ever more crucial: trade, financial flows, and environmental issues, such as bio-diversity and climate change. The second half considers three key aspects of localization: decentralization, cities as the engine of economic growth, and making cities livable.Identifies 4 critical lessons from development experience:       Macroeconomic stability is essential for achieving the growth needed for development Growth does not trickle down, so therefore, development efforts must address human needs directly  No one policy will spur development; a comprehensive approach is needed.  Sustained development must be socially inclusive and flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances. Report includes a focus on issues of urban growth and human welfare. Includes several detailed case studies of development issues in the 21st Century:Making the most of trade liberalization (Egypt)Reforming weak banking systems (Hungary)Macromanagement under fiscal decentralization (Brazil)Improving urban living conditions (Karachi, Pakistan): describes how government regulations set unrealistically high construction standards, thus putting ""formal sector"" housing beyond the reach of most people and fueling the growth of slums.

eldis:A46116;Can river communities benefit from resettlement?;;"The forced resettlement of river basin communities because of dam construction is a highly controversial process. It can be justified only if plans are implemented to enable resettlers to raise their living standards. They should be involved in all stages of project decision-making including project identification and, if a dam is selected, in project planning, implementation and monitoring.In the past,
people could express their concerns about dams and resettlement schemes to
project authorities, but this rarely had much impact. Today, the preferred
approach is partnerships with local people to involve them in all aspects of
resettlement, preferably as project shareholders and co-project managers.
Independent
research reviews recent trends of forced resettlement. Dam construction projects
can benefit local people by sharing the financial gains of a project, considering
local culture to enable more appropriate selection of sites, and assisting the
resettlement process. The research includes the rights of indigenous
communities who have often been subject to cultural discrimination during
resettlement planning and have not had any influence on resettlement policies.
There are
significant cultural, political and economic barriers to successful
resettlement schemes. The research shows:

The increasing diversity of
communities makes it difficult to ensure that everyone has opportunity to
participate in discussions and planning.
Project developers often overlook
cultural factors, such as traditional work activities and belief systems.
Promoting economic development and
improving living standards following resettlement are usually the most
difficult tasks.
An irrigation scheme included in dam
projects can be important for improving the living standards of resettled
populations and other nearby communities. It should be planned to achieve
multiplier effects that will provide additional employment opportunities
for resettlers.
Over-reliance on compensation leaves
resettlement communities impoverished once the compensation ends. Cash
compensation can also result in conflict between and within communities
and between individuals within households.

Giving more
power to displaced people during the planning process is essential for
effective resettlement. This includes planning of irrigation systems, selecting
appropriate sites for resettlement and identifying suitable economic and
culturally appropriate opportunities. If possible, dams should be situated in
locations that avoid resettlement. Where resettlement is unavoidable, projects
must benefit both construction companies and the local community to be
successful. Such scenarios will need participation of and partnership with the
local community. 
The research makes
several recommendations to ensure resettlement projects benefit poor people:

Before
each project, consider a wider range of energy and water resource
development options. Should a dam be selected, minimise resettlement as
much as possible. 
Where
resettlement is unavoidable, plan for affected people to become project
beneficiaries.
Provide
finance for communities to recruit the necessary experts, such as lawyers,
engineers and health experts.
Improve
understanding of local knowledge, values and lifestyles. Development
projects must balance new opportunities with culture and traditions.
Provide
resettled people with irrigated land and employment opportunities to
complement traditional rainfed agriculture.
Ensure
resettled communities have access to common property resources and
opportunities, such as reservoir fisheries, tourism and employment
training.

eldis:A42991;Climate variability and maize yield in South Africa: results from GME and MELE methods;;"This paper investigates the impact of climate variability on maize yield in the Limpopo Basin of South Africa using the Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) estimator and Maximum Entropy Leuven Estimator (MELE). Maize constitutes about 70 percent of grain production and covers about 60 percent of the cropping area in South Africa. It is a summer crop, mostly grown in semiarid regions of the country, and is highly susceptible to changes in precipitation and temperature. The two models directly estimate a yield function for maize with the two relevant climate variables, that is, temperature and precipitation, together with the other traditional inputs (labor, seed, fertilizer, and irrigation). The study finds that the MELE fits the available data better than the GME. Similarly, increased precipitation, increased temperature, and irrigation have a positive impact on yield. Furthermore, results from the MELE show that:

    the impact of precipitation on maize yield is stronger than that of temperature, meaning that the impact of climate variability on maize yield could be negative if the change increases temperature but reduces precipitation at the same rate and simultaneously
    the results from MELE point to the fact that a percentage reduction in mean precipitation could have greater negative impact on maize yield vis-à-vis the gain from an equal percentage increase in mean temperature due to climate change
    there is enough evidence that shows that the mean temperature has increased. On the other hand, mean rainfall is expected to decrease and its variance to increase in South Africa
    increase in temperature would impact negatively on maize yield and consequently pose a serious threat to food security within South Africa, which would also have an impact on the countries within the entire Southern African region that obtain about half of their maize from South Africa
    the impact of irrigation and mean precipitation on yield is positive, with precipitation having the overall highest impact on yield indicating that irrigation may partially mitigate the impact of decreased precipitation on yield, all other things being equal.

The workshop sought to raise awareness among indigenous livestock keepers on their rights over animal genetic resources.The workshop showcased the significance of traditional knowledge and social systems for upholding farm animal genetic diversity.  The papers presented at the workshop emphasised the need to safe-guard the rights of indigenous livestock communities, as laid down by the Convention on Biological Diversity.The workshop participants agreed upon an official statement, known as the The Karen Commitment, which highlighted the contribution of pastoralists and other livestock keepers to developing and conserving animal genetic resources.Main points of the Karen commitment include:governments and relevant international bodies should to commit themselves to the formal recognition of the historical and current contribution of pastoralists and pastoralism to food and livelihood security, environmental services and domestic animal diversitygovernments should recognise the contributions of pastoralists and other livestock keepers, in the conservation and sustainable use of animal genetic resources for food and agriculturethe establishment of international legally-binding recognition of inalienable livestock keepers’ rights and the rights of their communitiesthe FAO should develop a global plan for the conservation and sustainable use of associated species and the genes they contain by pastoralists, other livestock keeping communities and relevant public institutions.[adapted from author] ;;;Practical Action [Intermediate Technology Development Group];eldis;01/01/2004;en;"land use;agriculture";;Land Use, Management & Investment;202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A15624;http://www.pastoralpeoples.org/docs/KarenCommitment5.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pastoralpeoples.org%2Fdocs%2FKarenCommitment5.pdf;;;;"livestock;agriculture;land use;herders;Agriculture and food;Livelihoods;pastoralism;livestock breeding;Pastoralism;agricultural policy"
eldis:A75481;Land reform in Korea ;;"Land reform, which became widespread all over the world for a while after World War II, lost steam rapidly after the 1970s. Then, when the 21st century began, land reform-forgotten for a generation-has received attention again. Above all, this is because it has been a widely recognized perception that land reform should be required in order to solve poverty. This report examines how land reform has had an effect on the general economy and society of a country, based on Korea’s experience in land reform. It is highly expected that Korea’s experience will provide developing countries and international organizations, which have renewed interest in land reform, with a lot of implications. Although Korea’s land reform was historically the most successful case, it is unfortunate that continued research has not been conducted both at home and abroad. Taking the opportunity of the Knowledge Sharing Program (KSP) module project, this report has been prepared for sharing implications of Korea’s land reform with developing countries through more systematic evaluations of land reform

eldis:A42987;Whose forest tenure reform is it? Lessons from case studies in Vietnam;;"In Vietnam, forest area under the management of local people has expanded from almost nothing in the early 1990s to nearly 3.5 million hectares (27% of the national forest area) in 2006. This study looks at the extent to which such tenure reform has worked in practice and how it has affected local people’s livelihoods and well being. The study finds that: 
the best quality forests are still owned by state actors while non-state actors, particularly local people, have mostly been allocated poorer and degraded forestsfor forest resources already allocated to local people, legal permission from state authorities is still required for timber logging and use of forestland for cultivation the property rights provided for under the forestry law are not included in theforest land use titles that are agreed with local people production of high value forest products requires significant investment of capital and labour resources, two inputs which poor households generally lackin some communities, there has been no interruption of sustainable forest management practices that worked in the past .

Based on these findings, the study makes some recommendations, some of which are given below. 
In practice, the allocation of forest tenure rights to local people has not resulted in communities gaining actual control over local forests. For people to take meaningful control, power for management decisions must transferred by the state. Lack of clarity in the policy framework, slow responses by authorities to remedy mistakes, and local people’s limited knowledge of their rights and how to protect them have all undermined forest tenure reform. Local people should therefore be provided with appropriate legal education. The impact of forest tenure reform on poverty alleviation is unclear. Forest tenure reform should be made more pro-poor. This should include allocation of better quality forest to the local people, the design of mechanisms for equitable distribution of forest resources among recipients, and the provision of pro-poor capacity building and extension support. Local forest management traditions have endured in spite of decades of state control. With appropriate support, communities can build on these traditions and organize themselves to sustainably manage forests.Local customs should be respected. This could include improving state policies so that they are flexible in accounting for local variation of customs and culture and educating local state officials that scientific forestry is not the only way to manage forests.

eldis:A39518;Financing sustainable forest management;;"Despite the adoption of many international agreements over the last decades, degradation of forests and deforestation has continued. Since this is largely due to the market's failure to account for forests' multifunctionality, this issue argues that a new, holistic approach is necessary to ensure sustainable forest management (SFM) is adequately supported and financed. Against this background, 35 articles explore the role of:

    multilateral conventions, agreements and organisations (such as UNFF, UNCCD, UNFCCC, and ITTO)
    international non-government organisations such as WWF, CIFOR and the Global Forest Coalition
    governance, institutions and financing in making SFM a viable alternative to other forest uses
    capital markets in enhancing forest investment
    payment for ecosystem/environmental services (PES) schemes in bridging the gap between payment and the unrecognised demand for environmental goods
    forests in climate change mitigation and energy generation (as underlined by the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme).

It is argued that forest financing should support three objectives: 

    forest conservation and sustainable use
    maintenance of ecosystem services
    fair and equitable sharing of benefits 

The articles discuss that to stop deforestation and forest degradation it will be important to take a number of actions. Recommendations include:

    keep SFM initiatives coherent despite the recent mushrooming of international mechanisms
    support capacity-building rather than simply generating more money for SFM
    rapidly identify and expand opportunities not only to maintain the remaining forest resources, but to increase forest cover worldwide
    develop holistic financing strategies for forest sector development and underpin them by sectoral policies
    ensure good governance, i.e. the rule of law, transparency, democracy, participation and accountability
    ensure forest-land tenure is secure and well-defined
    prevent unplanned and uncoordinated changes in land use driven by factors outside of the forest sector
    make sure payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are pro-poor and keep transaction costs low.

eldis:A15400;Rural-urban linkages in sub-Saharan Africa: contemporary debates and implications for Kenyan urban workers in the 21st century;;"This CMI working paper provides an overview of rural-urban linkages in sub-Saharan Africa outlining the major strands of contemporary academic debates on this issue. There author identifies two interrelated debates for discussion. The first is about the historiography of migrancy, predominantly in Southern and Eastern Africa; the other one is about the relationship between research on labour migration and the policy prescriptions that ostensibly follow.The author goes on to draw some tentative conclusions about what might be the implications of these debates for urban workers in Kenya. These include:The oscillatory labour migration system is clearly under severe strain , which is only likely to increase in years ahead. A key factor is access to land. As long as the principle of partible land inheritance is practiced the ensuing fragmentation will only reinforce the need for an urban source of income.The value placed on land ownership acts as some deterrent against a massive rural exodus and as long as neither the urban wage level nor the agricultural production on small plots suffice to support an average family, the circular migration strategy between rural and urban is likely to persist. The population pressure on land is likely to increase the number of landless or near-landless who will have to convert to 'urbanites', requiring high economic growth rates and attendant employment creation to accomodate them into a stable mainstream economy. To achieve this  is a 'tall order' according to the author although the recent change of government in Kenya offered some cause for optimism. ";A. Tostensen;;Chr.

eldis:A69753;Maputo and informal land tenure arrangements;;"It is clear that despite the legislation that governs land, people have their own widely accepted and low conflict land management system in urban areas, which involves multiple role-players. This finding is backed up by the negligible occurrence of the DUAT in the two neighbourhoods surveyed. Indeed, even with Mozambique’s nationalisation policy and post-war context, much urban land supply is predominantly informal and bogged down by vested economic and elite interests.

Furthermore, local land management arrangements are not always the ‘chaotic mess’ they are perceived to be. This research reveals a set of widely used rules and practices regarding land access, holding and trading in the two peri-urban sites in Maputo, where households do not have registered title to land.

Also, rather than being purely the domain of the state and the law, land governance is co-constructed by state and non-state role-players with varying levels of legitimacy. Any interventions to strengthen governance should, therefore be aware of the array of rule-makers and the dynamic nature of authority in urban spaces.

This study is based on findings from a research study that investigated how the poor access, hold and trade land in two peri-urban settlements in Maputo – Luis Cabral and Hulene B. The findings suggest that a land market that is technically outside of the legal system exists. Notwithstanding its illegality, the land practices operating there are organised and relatively sophisticated local land management and regulatory systems. The low incidence of land conflicts in the study sites shows that these practices are relatively functional and are characterised by a well organised system of social role-players, including family members, neighbours, local leadership structures and state officials, all of whom lend credibility and legitimacy to local land management arrangements and a local land market. This situation shows that informal urban economies in Maputo are co-produced by state and non-state regulatory systems. Such hybrid economies have implications for how we understand governance, markets and the role of the state in our cities.

Concluding, the research provides the foundations for alternative conceptual framework of land management in Maputo. It also puts forward an alternative way of thinking about the formal / informal land market dichotomy. In doing so it advocates for the strengthening of land security across a continuum of land rights in the land market.

eldis:A21774;Land registration in Nampula and Zambezia provinces, Mozambique;;Assesses the process of rural land registration in Mozambique and the outcomes for poor and marginalised groups. The research finds that community land registration, under the 1997 land law, can strengthen community rights to use and benefit from their land in relation to outsider interests in land. However, intra-community and intra-household land rights are not addressed, since it is only community land boundaries which are registered. The relatively centralised and complex registration procedures means that smallholder farmers are heavily dependent on NGOs to facilitate the process, which raises issues of continuity and sustainability. Individual registration of land is possible too, but is mainly taken up by private investors and companies. There are some serious shortcomings in this process: community consultations, required by law, are often inadequate and there is little supervision to ensure that compulsory land development plans produced by investors are implemented in practice. These issues will need to be tackled in order to for rural land registration be really pro-poor in practice.This report forms part of a series of seven papers based on a research programme entitled “Securing Land Rights in Africa: Can land registration serve the poor?” led by IIED. ;"A.

Through an array of satellite images, graphs, maps, and photographs, this Atlas presents a powerful testament to the adverse changes taking place on the African landscape as a result of intensified  natural and human impacts. The atlas is composed of three parts: 

    the first part provides a comprehensive overview of Africa's geographical attributes, highlighting issues such as land degradation and desertification, water stress, declining biodiversity, deforestation, increasing dust storms, rising pollution and rapid urbanisation 
    part two presents examples of transboundary environmental issues related to shared lands and waters, migrating animals and people, and pollutants that drift over borders of neighbouring countries. It highlights both emerging challenges and success stories in addressing these issues
    part three contains brief profiles of every African country, their important environmental issues, and a description of how each is faring in terms of progress towards the targets under the UN’s Millennium Development Goal 7, which is to ensure environmental sustainability. “Before and after” satellite images from every country highlight specific places where change is particularly evident. 

Observations and measurements of environmental change illustrated in this Atlas help gauge the extent of progress made by African countries towards reaching the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals.

eldis:A31568;The Chad-Cameroon oil & pipeline project: a project non-compliance report;;"This report assesses the role of the World Bank in the funding and management of the Chad-Cameroon oil and pipeline project. The report argues that the project has fueled violence, impoverished people in the oil fields and along the pipeline route, exacerbated the pressures on indigenous peoples and created new environmental problems. The report highlights how the World Bank’s Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is inconsistent with other independent reports on the project. The ICR falsely claims that the compensation plan for Indigenous Peoples has been implemented in a timely manner and that that affected communities participate in economic development. Furthermore, one of the key promises of the project, enshrined in the Bank's loan and project agreements, was that all additional oil using the pipeline would be subject to the same environmental and social standards. The ICR now admits that enforcing this clause will be problematic. The report argues that the World Bank must address the outstanding environmental, livelihood and compensation problems. In particular, the Bank needs to address the concerns of Cameroon's indigenous Bakola/Bagyeli people, who have seen a worsening of their already precarious situation, and who face threats to their survival as a people. The report makes the following recommendations: 

    resolving problems of dust pollution, hazardous waste and general public health 
    ensuring adequate compensation and the restoration of livelihoods in the oil-producing region 
    scanning all regional compensation projects for defects, identifying solutions and resolving outstanding grievances
    ensuring active participation by indigenous peoples in the Indigenous Peoples Plan and ensuring their right of ownership to the land they traditionally occupy

eldis:A56473;African range wars: climate, conflict, and property rights;;"This paper examines the effect of climate change on pastoralist conflict in Africa. The rangelands of East Africa is particularly vulnerable to drought, which is associated with climate change. In this respect, the paper focuses its analysis on changes in resource availability contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The authors clarify that the role of resources is further contextualised by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. They argue that any analysis of climate change and conflict needs to account for property rights protection and even more importantly the bias in these property rights. The document makes the following findings:

    pastoralist conflicts are typically fought over water rights or grazing rights to unfenced land 
    the state is rarely involved directly and is playing limited role in establishing, protecting and recognising property rights in Africa’s rangelands
    violence between pastoral groups should be understood as more than just resource conflicts
    conflict is generally increasing with resource abundance contingent on property rights bias
    if a relationship between ecological degradation and armed conflict exists, it should be strongly evident in the form of inter-communal or ethnic violence.

eldis:A40432;Malaysian palm oil - green gold or green wash?;;"Focusing on Sarawak, this paper confronts the misleading claims of the Malaysian palmoil lobby and aims to inform decision makers about the serious sustainability challenges the palm oil sector faces on the ground. Key areas of contention highlighted include that:

    the Malaysian palm oil lobby claims that zero-burning is strictly enforced by Malaysia’s laws. The authors argue that this claim is false. Sarawak has in place its own environmental laws, which allow plantation companies to practice open burning to clear land for planting, even on peat soils
    the Malaysian palm oil lobby states that “forests are not converted for oil palm expansion in Malaysia”. This claim is also seen as false. The report asserts that there is an overwhelming body of evidence that oil palm plantations are being expanded at the expense of tropical forests
    the Malaysian palm oil lobby also claims that the Penan indigenous communities in Sarawak were given large tracts of virgin forests to sustain their nomadic way of life - which is also regarded a false claim. The “Biosphere Reserves” promised to the Penan have no legal basis and have never materialised.

To address the serious sustainability challenges of the oil palm sector in Malaysia, the paper recommends that:

    the EU and Member States should limit additional demand for palm oil products by: halting the use of edible oils for energy purposes; abandoning the 10% EU target for bio-fuels and all incentives for the use of palm oil for energy purposes; promoting and supporting efforts to improve transparency; and establishing business systems that apply best practices in dealing with sustainability challenges in the sector 
    the Sarawak state government and the Malaysian Federal Government should recognise the full nature and stature of Native Customary Rights (NCR) of its indigenous peoples as accorded by the law, establish a system of joint-boundary demarcation with native communities to demarcate native territorial boundaries and claims, and strictly enforce a zero burning policy for commercial plantation development 
    the Malaysian oil palm industry, and its customers and investors should acknowledge the sustainability challenges in the sector and ensure that all the parties involved are committed to addressing them.

eldis:A10851;Bringing the vertical dimension to the negotiating table: preliminary assessment of a conflict resolution case in the Philippines;;This report shows how Participatory 3-D Modelling and other advanced geographic and cartographic techniques have helped in consensual solutions for land and resource tenure conflicts, based on an improved understanding and visualisation of territorial landmarks. It presents photos and detailed descriptions of a conflict resolution experience in the Phillipines.In remote, poorly served areas, community-based mapping methods can help in addressing boundary issues through the visualization of the landscape, associated land uses and settlement pattern. Since 1987, scaled relief models have been used in Northern Thailand to deal with conflicts among ethnic minorities and between these and government agencies. In the Philippines, the use of 3-D models started later in 1993. Integrated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Participatory 3-D Modelling (P3DM) has been used among Indigenous Peoples under the auspices of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and lately, of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP). This article discusses how the method has contributed to a successfull conflict resolution case in the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Philippines.In a context where cultural and biological diversities have been under great pressure from logging, mining, conversion of forests into farmland, population increase, and movement of lowland communities into areas traditionally occupied by Indigenous Peoples (IPs), maps exerted all their power in addressing resource tenure and access conflicts, and in influencing national governance. Cartography resulting from two and three dimensional community- based maps, supported by GPS/GIS applications, formed the foundations upon which IPs filed numerous applications to the GENR's Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim (CADC), and developed ancestral domain resource management plans.Through the use of the relief model, it became apparent that diverse ethno-linguistic groups were using different names for natural landmarks, like creeks and peaks. Different denominations and interpretations of landmarks and features were ineluctably sources of disagreement. When a process is geared towards addressing conflicts bound to the territory, communication systems are essential ingredients to provide all parties with equal access to information in order to develop a common understanding of the issues at stake. When language barriers like the ones existing among the Elders of different ethno-linguistic groups in the Cordillera do represent an additional constraint, information exchange best occurs via visual communication based on colour, shape and texture, like in a 3-D model. In such context, there is no doubt that the third  dimension and the holistic view offered by the relief model have been key factors in facilitating the consolidation of the negotiation process: there were only one highest mountain and one creek so-and-so to be named, seen, felt and touched by all concerned.This preliminary assessment of the Balbalan case indicates that the use of a 1:5,000-scale relief model, encompassing the entire municipality and portions of the neighbouring municipalities, has been instrumental in facilitating a series of consensual conflict resolution processes. Almost all have led to potentially stable solutions, anchored on objectively verifiable, geo-referenced sources, including a 3-D model, derived map and the technical descriptions that will be produced by the forthcoming ground survey. In the light of growing development pressures, agreements making use of sketch maps and non-technical descriptions appear to be shortlived because these are prone to subjective interpretations. In addition, the model has contributed to improving communication by creating a shared vantage point and a common visual vocabulary, thus bridging communication barriers due to different perspectives and spoken languages. ;"G.

eldis:A38181;Women, slums and urbanisation: examining the causes and consequences;;"Countries throughout the world are rapidly urbanising, particularly in the developing world, and for the first time in human history, the majority of people today are no longer living in rural areas, but rather in cities. This report examines the worldwide phenomenon of urbanisation from the point of view of women’s housing rights. The report focuses, in particular, on the experiences of women and girls living in slum communities throughout the world, premised on the idea that both the causes and consequences of urbanisation for women are, in fact, unique and deeply related to issues of gender. The report highlights women’s experiences from Africa, Asia and the Americas and background information on the global realities of urbanisation, including trends and analysis. The authors assess some of the primary ‘drivers’ for women’s migration to the cities, including issues such as violence against women, forced eviction, and the feminisation of poverty. These drivers illuminate some of the causes of urbanisation from a gender-sensitive perspective, reflecting the various catalysts which serve to propel women into the cities. Finally the report presents the key findings and conclusions of the study based on research conducted in the field. These include that governments should: 

    provide security of tenure, as a matter of priority, to women and their families living in slums 
    combat violence against women in all its forms, and provide  effective legal and other remedies to victims of gender-based  violence
    invest in slum upgrading programmes and housing development programmes for the poor, ensuring women’s  effective participation 
    ensure joint ownership of and control over housing, land, and  property, as well as equal rights between men and women in  marriage 
    enforce women’s inheritance rights and equal rights to marital property 
    raise awareness about women’s human rights, including  women’s housing rights, at community and institutional levels

eldis:A19958;Land tenure, land use and sustainability in Kenya: towards innovative use of property rights in wildlife management;;Examining the assumption that private property rights create incentives for the management of resources, this paper argues that private property rights and current wildlife conservation and management laws and policies in Kenya fail to provide the solution to wildlife biodiversity erosion.  This is partly because of their preoccupation with a monolithic system of property ownership favouring the state and individuals and neglecting communities and/or groups.The document includes sections on:laws and policies relevant to wildlife managementproperty rights and sustainable wildlife management: a critiquerethinking property rights for wildlife management in Kenyaworking around the limits of property rights: innovative use of propert rights sustainable wildlife managementFindings from the paper include:there is a lack of sufficient incentives for sustainable wildlife managementthere is a lack of legal framework for involvement of local communities in sustainable wildlife managementconservation was conceived as a process removed from people, especially the native Kenyansthe failure of colonialists to to appreciate the nature of the natives Kenyan's traditional rights led to undue disregard for those rights and this has affected the conceptions of property by the native Kenyans to this daymost laws and policies applicable to resource conservation in Kenya are formulated along the lines of specific sectors. Laws on propert rights and land use may run counter to those on wildlife managementbesides the problem of systematic encroachment on wildlife habitats by other land-use categories, the present forms of wildlife utilisation also pose serious management problems.The document suggests that in order for sustainable wildlife management to succeed, perceived benefits have to outweigh the benefits of building up the area, using the area as pasture land or cultivating it.  Some ways in which conservation imperatives can be harmonised with the aspirations of rural communtites is through the chanelling of benefits derived from wildlife to such communities. ;P.

eldis:A37540;Mitigating the impact of climate change and land degradation through IFAD’s COSOP in Viet Nam.;;"This report analyses the impact of climate change and land degradation on agriculture and related sectors in Viet Nam. It intends to guide the project based on the design of the Country Strategic Opportunities Paper (COSOP) priorities and to identify supplementary financing for International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) projects from the UNFCCC and other carbon related financing mechanisms. It is explained that the harmful effects of climate change are already being experienced in Viet Nam, and farming communities have begun to respond by: 

    introducing livestock breeds that can withstand increased temperatures
    shifting crop varieties such as from rice to maize
    introducing drought resistant crop varieties
    adopting water saving methods. 

Over the last century, average temperatures in the Mekong region have risen by 0.3 to 0.8°C. Further temperature increases are expected along with more extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall, and rising sea levels. However, considering that more than three-quarters of Viet Nam’s labour force is engaged in the agriculture sector, the scale of interventions will need to be significantly increased if continued economic growth is to be achieved. Key policy implications include:

    forward planning and implementation of a rural development and agriculture strategy that is knowledgeable about climate change will help offset many of its harmful effects
    IFAD should consider supporting Viet Nam in its current efforts to develop a climate change Mitigation and Adaptation Action Plan for the agricultural and rural development sector as a contribution to the National Strategy and Action Framework for Climate Change
    given the geographic scale and time horizon being discussed, IFAD will need to pursue a multi-pronged approach that supports Viet Nam in developing the enabling framework concurrently with on-the ground adaptation and mitigation measures
    focus areas suggested for informing Viet Nam’s Mitigation and Adaptation Action Plan include: continued work on securing access for the rural poor to land and forest resources, adoption of food security measures (safety nets) and provision of alternative livelihood options.

eldis:A61808;'Agriculture', in Climate change 2007: mitigation;;"This contributory chapter of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) outlines the status of climate change mitigation in agriculture and its implications on development, production and consumption trends. It presents regional and global trends in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as future global trends. The chapter breaks down numerous examples of proposed climate mitigation measures, including a table outlining whether each measure has a positive or negative mitigative effect on levels of greenhouse gases (CH2, CH4 and N2O), as well as a grade for the level of scientific agreement and amount of evidence available. The measures divide into the following seven categories.

    Cropland management: examples include the benefits of set-asides, land use changes and water management in mitigating N2O.
    Pasture improvement: examples include grazing intensity, fire management and species introduction, though none of these feature highly with regard to evidence or agreement of benefits.
    Management of organic soil: while avoiding the drainage of wetlands may help mitigate CO2 levels, it is likely to have a negative effect on CH4 mitigation.
    Restoration of degraded lands: this involves erosion control and organic and nutrient amendments.
    Livestock management: measures such as improving feeding practices, dietary additives and longer term structural changes in management and breeding can aid CH4 and N2O mitigation.
    Biosolid management: this includes improved storage and anaerobic digestion.
    Bioenergy: examples include a variety of sources for biofuel, such as energy crops and agricultural by-products.

The authors discuss the interactions of mitigation options with adaptation and vulnerability, followed by the potentials, barriers and implementation issues of climate policies and the effects of non-climate policies on greenhouse gas emissions. The chapter highlights some co-benefits and trade-offs of mitigation options, again with a substantial table breaking down mitigative effects by emission type. The chapter finishes with a look at technology research and diffusion and a long-term outlook, which concludes that the prospects for greenhouse gas mitigation in agriculture hold significant potential.

eldis:A15150;The water issue between Singapore and Malaysia: no solution in sight?;;"Singapore has been dependent on Malaysia for nearly forty percent of its water supply, and water has been a source of dispute between the two countries.  This paper examines the water issues between Singapore and Malaysia.The paper describes the water agreements signed in 1961 and 1962.  It discusses some of the important aspects of the dispute between Singapore and Malaysia, including the debate on pricing, the right to revise prices, and the guarantee of supplies after 2061.  It analyses the economics of water, in particular, the water demand and supply situation in Singapore in 1960-2000.  The paper also examines the contention that the Malaysian state of Johor is making losses by selling raw water to Singapore and buying treated water from Singapore.Finally, the paper explores the potential for alternative sources of water supply, such as through desalination and recycled water.The paper finds that:Singapore is seeking to diversify its water supplies to include supplies from IndonesiaNewater (recycled water) can be produced in sufficient quantities to replace water that Singapore is currently purchasing from Malaysiabased on an analysis of costs and prices, it does not seem that Johor has been losing money by buying treated water from SingaporeSingapore has weaned itself from a condition of extreme water dependency to one of near self-sufficiency.  However, self-sufficiency would only occur by 2011.Overall, the paper concludes that the ""water threat"" is less than what it seems to be.The paper recommends that Singapore should source its water requirements domestically if the price of raw water in Malaysia is increased beyond a certain level. At the same time, the paper suggests that the Singapore government should consider the social and economic impacts of sourcing of water by desalination and recycling (NeWater).However, even if it becomes self-sufficient, the paper notes that the Singapore government has said that it would continue to purchase water, under fair terms, from Malaysia or any other country willing to be its long term supplier.  If Singapore continues to source for water elsewhere, the paper recommends that there should be a framework to facilitate the purchase and supply of water between countries in the region.In terms of the current water disputes between Malaysia and Singapore, the paper suggests that an appropriate negotiation mechanism is required to resolve the current deadlock, and find an equitable pricing structure that maximizes monetary benefits for both countries.

eldis:A59807;Integrating protected areas into climate planning;;"This paper argues for the need to make protected areas more directly relevant in the light of climate change. This includes the contribution of protected areas towards sustainable livelihoods, the provision of ecosystem services, and ensuring climate mitigation, resilience, and adaptation. The author advocates for mainstreaming protected area planning into sectors such as transportation and energy, reviewing the economic importance of protected areas while addressing climate-related concerns, and ensuring that protected areas form an integral part of climate adaptation efforts. The paper gives guidelines on ensuring that climate change issues and concerns incorporate the future of protected areas. These guidelines depend on:

    the location of the protected areas
    their management
    their ability to directly incorporate and maximise climate change mitigation, resilience, and adaptation

It is emphasised that despite trade-offs between biodiversity conservation (the original mandate of protected area creation) and management for climate change; protected areas provide considerable social, economic, and ecological benefits that make them a natural and cost-effective investment for mitigating climate change. The paper highlights the fact that the management of protected areas can be optimised to maximise the benefits that they provide to adaptation, mitigation, and resilience building.

eldis:A67981;Adoption and extent of conservation agriculture practices among smallholder farmers in Malawi;;"Understanding factors affecting farmers’ adoption of improved technologies is critical to success of conservation agriculture (CA) program implementation. This study, which explored the factors that determine adoption and extent of farmers’ use of the three principles of CA (i.e., minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with crop residues, and crop rotations), was conducted in 10 target communities in 8 extension planning areas in Malawi. The primary data was collected using structured questionnaires administered to individual households. Triangulation with key informant interviews, field observations, and interactive discussions with farmers and farmer groups provided information behind contextual issues underpinning the statistical inferences. From a total of 15,854 households in the study areas, it is estimated that 18% of the smallholder farmers had adopted CA, representing an area of about 678 ha (1,675 ac; 2.1% of all cultivated land). Land area under CA constituted about 30% of total cultivated land among adopters. A random sample of 151 adopters and 149 nonadopters proportional with respect to adoption rates was drawn from various communities and interviewed using structured questionnaires. A total of 30 key informant interviews were conducted with stakeholders including staff of Total Land Care, government extension workers, agroinput suppliers, and lead farmers. The first stage of the Heckman model showed that hired labor, area of land cultivated, membership to farmer group, and district influenced farmers’ decisions to adopt CA. The second stage of Heckman model results suggested that total cultivated land, duration of practicing CA, and district influenced farmers’ decisions to extend their land to CA. Our study can be used to show the agency and social structures that are likely to influence adoption and extent of CA. Future policy should address ways to provide access to information and long-term support to farmers to enable them to embrace the technology fully.

eldis:A75259;Agricultural sector assessment for St. Kitts and Nevis ;;"This study presents the findings of an agricultural assessment for St. Kitts and Nevis in 1983 funded by USAID.

It suggests that more intensive use of labour and land could occur if individuals or groups of individuals have more widespread and secure access to government controlled land. The paper recommends that a project be developed that assists several hundred people to become farm operators, through land purchase arrangements or long term land leases, on land that is government controlled.

eldis:A63118;Adaptation of land-use demands to the impact of climate change on the hydrological processes of an urbanized watershed;;"The adaptation of land-use patterns is an essential aspect of minimising the impact of climate change at regional and local scales; for example, adapting watershed land-use patterns to mitigate the impact of climate change on a region’s hydrology. The aim of this study is to simulate and assess a region’s ability to adapt to hydrological changes by modifying land-use patterns in the Wu-Du watershed in northern Taiwan. A hydrological GWLF (Generalised Watershed Loading Functions) model is used to simulate three hydrological components - runoff, groundwater and streamflow - based on various land-use scenarios under six global climate models. The study finds that the effects of climate change on groundwater and runoff can be mitigated by modifying current land-use patterns and slowing the rate of urbanisation. Therefore, the study concludes that land-use adaptation on a local/regional scale provides an alternative way to reduce the impacts of climate change on local hydrology. ";Y-P.

eldis:A60485;Climate change and water: IPCC technical paper VI;;"This IPCC technical paper extensively and thoroughly examines the potential consequences of climate change on the world’s freshwater resources and the communities that depend on them. Its objective is to improve understanding of how water-related issues are linked to climate change and adaptation and mitigation responses. The methodology splits sections into observed and projected effects with error margins and a stress on uncertainty presented as necessary context. The paper explains the influences of hydrological changes on climate, as well as outlining the observed and projected effects of climate change as related to all of the following:

    precipitation
    snow and land ice 
    sea Level (where it impacts freshwater supplies) 
    evapotranspiration 
    soil moisture 
    runoff and river discharge 
    patterns of large-scale variability 

One section focuses on the link between climate change and water resources, taking into account non-climatic changes that are likely to exacerbate problems (such as increased freshwater demand due to population growth and development). A lack of data hampers efforts to quantify impacts of climate-related changes to water resources, though it is considered ‘highly likely’ that efforts at sustainable development will be negatively impacted. The authors breakdown, by sector, observations and projections of climate-related impacts, together with potential vulnerabilities and suggested adaptive strategies. Sectors analysed include agriculture, health, water supply, settlements, economy and biodiversity.  A range of climate change mitigation measures are discussed, mainly covering renewable energy sectors (i.e. bio-energy, hydropower, geothermal), land-use and water management strategies. Potential conflicts between mitigation and adaptation are also raised that, while marginal on a global scale, can nevertheless have significant impacts at the regional level, (i.e. trade-offs between water supply and hydropower or flood control). Implications for future policy are detailed in depth, both by sector and region, as well as the implications for mitigation and sustainable development. Risks are presented probabilistically (i.e. likely, highly likely, etc.) to best reflect present uncertainties; even so the paper finds numerous significant challenges worthy of concern, and stresses the increased vulnerability of those already at risk. The authors recommend for more extensive research to plug knowledge gaps, including the need for further refining of modelling data and spatial resolution. ";"B.C. Bates (ed)

eldis:A13842;The direct and underlying causes of forest loss;;"This paper assesses the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation and the forces behind unsustainable agriculture. It demonstrates the far-reaching consequences of globalisation, in terms of land tenure policies and inequalities. It examines consumption and production patterns and the global problem with many actors. It further looks at the burden of the military on the worlds forest resources.Causes of deforestation: major international economic phenomena, such as macro-economic strategies which provide a strong incentive for short-term profit-making instead of long-term sustain abilitydeep-rooted social structures, which result in inequalities in land tenure, discrimination against indigenous peoples, subsistence farmers and poor people in generalpolitical factors such as the lack of participatory democracy, the influence of the military and the exploitation of rural areas by urban elitesoverconsumption by consumers in high-income countries constitutes another of the major underlying causes of deforestationuncontrolled industrialisation, with widespread pollution resulting in acid rainThe paper demonstrates that it is important to realise that deforestation and forest degradation are not ""technical"" issues. Forests are disappearing because a number of interlinked international and national policies prepare the ground for it to happen. It is therefore at that level that solutions must be found. In addition, it is crucial to reach out to the public at large in order to ensure that such changes are actually implemented in a way that both humanity as a whole and the people living in the forest areas benefit from them equally.

eldis:A25257;Roads, lands, markets, and deforestation: a spatial model of land use in Belize;;"Will intensifying the road network around market areas produce greater economic returns and less environmental damage than extending the road network into new areas?Rural roads promote economic development but also facilitate deforestation. To explore the trade-offs between development and environmental damage posed by road building, Chomitz and Gray develop and estimate a spatially explicit model of land use. This model takes into account location and land characteristics and predicts land use at each point on the landscape.They find that:Market access and distance to roads strongly affect the probability of agricultural use, especially for commercial agriculture. High slopes, poor drainage, and low soil fertility discourage both commercial and semi subsistence agriculture. Semi subsistence agriculture is especially sensitive to soil acidity and lack of nitrogen (confirming anthropological findings that subsistence farmers are shrewd judges of soil).Spatially explicit models are analytically powerful because they exploit rich spatial variation in causal variables, including the precise siting of roads. They are useful for policy because they can pinpoint threats to particular critical habitats and watersheds.This model is a descendant of the venerable Thunen model. It assumes that land will tend to be devoted to its highest value use, taking into account tenure and other constraints. The value of a plot for a particular use depends on the land's physical productivity for that use and the farm gate prices of relevant inputs and outputs. A reduced form, multinomial logit specification of this model calculates implicit values of land in alternative uses as a function of land location and characteristics. The resulting equations can then be used for prediction or analysis.The model was applied to cross-sectional data for 1989_92 for Belize, a forested country currently experiencing rapid expansion of both subsistence and commercial agriculture. A geographic information system was used to manage the spatial data and extract variables based on a three kilometre sample grid.Three land uses were distinguished: ""natural"" vegetation, comprising forests, woodlands, wetlands, and savanna; semi subsistence agriculture, comprising traditional milpa (slashandburn) cultivation and other non mechanized cultivation of annual crops; and commercial agriculture, consisting mainly of sugarcane, pasture, citrus, and mechanized production of corn and kidney beans.Two dimensions of distance to market were distinguished: the distance from each sample point to the road, and in road travel time to the nearest town. Data on a wide variety of land and soil characteristics were also used.This paper --- a product of the Environment, Infrastructure, and Agriculture Division, Policy Research Department --- is part of a larger effort in the department to understand the causes and consequences of environmental change.

eldis:A70779;Natural resources, the environment and conflict;;"This report emanates from an exploratory study conducted in 2009 by the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD), in collaboration with the Madariaga-College of Europe Foundation. With a focus on Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan, the study solicited views and perspectives on the role that natural resources and the environment can play in complex conflict situations. As part of the exploratory study, ACCORD carried out desktop research and interviews with representatives of civil society organisations (CSOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international institutions in March and April 2009.

In reviewing the exploratory study and preparing this report, ACCORD observed five main challenges. The challenges relate first to the problem of natural resources and the environment in complex conflict situations, and second, to the actors that can play a constructive role in natural resource, environmental and conflict management.


	conflict management: increasingly, conflict management approaches should take the environment and natural resources into account when attempting to prevent violent conflict from erupting; negotiating and implementing durable peace agreements; deploying peace support operations; and establishing preventative and post-conflict peacebuilding mechanisms
	a lack of viable alternatives: environmental changes and inequalities in the global economy are not solely responsible for resource exploitation or direct causes of conflict. Rather, it is the lack of alternatives for those reliant on the natural environment for their livelihoods and/or for power and wealth that can contribute to conflict
	
	conflict-sensitive natural resource and environmental planning: Relating to the first challenge, the absence of long-term strategic conflict-sensitive planning – which takes into account creeping vulnerabilities and assesses their negative impact on livelihoods and conflicts – undermines future conflict management and peacebuilding
	
	
	government and civil society: the interdependent role of government and civil society actors in environmental and natural resource governance is vital for the equitable management of natural resources, environmental protection and strengthening sustainable livelihoods
	


 


	external actors:neighbouring states, multinational companies (MNCs) and other non-state actors involved in illegal extraction of resources can benefit from – and consequently, contribute to – the perpetuation of chaotic conflict situations


Finally, the report concludes with observations about renewable and non-renewable resources and environmental factors.

eldis:A72959;Irresponsible investment: AGRICA's broken development model in Tanzania;;"Kilombero Plantations Ltd (KPL) is a 5,818 hectare (ha) rice plantation located in the heart of the fertile Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. In addition to developing a large-scale rice farm, KPL works with local smallholder farmers through an outgrower model based on System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technologies. The investment project receives considerable financial and technical support from various development institutions including the UK Department for International Development (DfID) and USAID.  This report presents the findings of an investigation carried out in Tanzania between 2011 and 2015 of KPL’s investment venture, focusing on the impacts experienced by surrounding communities.
The major findings of the report are as follows: First, while KPL is often portrayed as a truly responsible investment venture, villagers in the surrounding communities complain of adverse impacts on their livelihoods resulting from KPL’s acquisition of land. Despite the adoption of World Bank guidelines on involuntary resettlement which promises to improve, or at least restore, livelihoods of project-affected people, KPL has, in many cases, allegedly failed to safeguard the interests of local communities who instead report losses. Compensation offered for the loss of land and houses appears to have been largely underestimated, not allowing those displaced by the project to get access to adequate alternative land for their livelihoods.
Second, KPL’s SRI outgrower scheme was introduced as a way of complementing production on nucleus farms and to provide opportunities to local farmers. With the implementation of new technologies, farmers report improved yields and have even been found to outperform the KPL nucleus farm in terms of productivity per hectare. Despite an improvement in yields, local farmers allege that the outgrower scheme has left many in despair. Struggling with debt repayments, farmers report being forced into distress sales of their belongings. These problems are seemingly related to the outgrower contracts that smallholders entered into with KPL. In addition, according to previous employees, plantation employment has failed to generate tangible benefits for the local community due to low salaries and limited opportunities for recruitment to full-time positions.
Third, this report raises concerns about the environmental impact of the project in an area of high ecological and biodiversity value. The prolonged use of agro-chemicals raises concerns about the presence of their compounds in soil and water and the pollution of nearby rivers, streams, and wetland areas used by the local communities. Villagers surrounding the plantation allege having experienced several negative effects from KPL’s agro-chemical application regime due to drifting and surface run-off. Moreover, KPL’s future plans to utilize the nearby Mngeta River for irrigation are worrisome in a context where there is limited reliable information of both water availability and the water requirements of the complex floodplain ecosystem and downstream users. Experts claim that the Mngeta River is already experiencing effects of climate change.
In conclusion, this report illustrates the difficulties in creating beneficial synergies and balance between the interests of smallholder farmers and those of large-scale agribusinesses. It critically questions the role of large-scale farms in agricultural development as they tend to create more problems than they solve, even when they attempt to include small-scale farmers in their strategy. The findings presented in this report cast serious doubt on the substantial aid money directed towards supporting corporate-led agricultural development. This is especially relevant in the broader Tanzanian development context where large-scale agribusinesses are envisioned greater roles.

eldis:A69722;Plotting progress: integrated planning  in the rangelands of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda;;"Planning for development in rangelands, including land use planning, holds particular challenges and can impose unusual constraints on routine activities. Rangeland planners must address a number of challenges: the sheer size of administrative units with sparsely distributed populations and variable, patchy resources; the independent nature of pastoral and huntergatherer cultures; high levels of environmental variability; and the complexities of managing semi-natural ecosystems. Planners must also confront the additional challenge of managing the interface between high- and low-potential areas that are functionally interdependent. On a temporal basis too, the seasonal and flexible dynamics of pastoral systems rarely fit with the more constrained and rigid administrative, government yearly cycles of planning or finances.In response to these issues and challenges, this paper draws together and reviews current and recent experience in planning processes in the rangelands of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. Key lessons are drawn out from two types of intervention – those led by government and those led by NGOs. These form the basis of a set of recommendations for different actors.

eldis:A71475;Natural resources and conflict: A guide for mediation practitioners;;"Natural resources such as land, water, timber, minerals, metals and oil are vitally important sources of livelihoods, income and influence for countries and communities around the globe. When natural resources are poorly managed or inequitably shared, however, or when business operations are implemented without due consideration for context and communities, they can contribute to tensions that can escalate into violent conflict, or feed into and exacerbate pre-existing conflict dynamics. Moreover, population growth and environmental degradation are intensifying competition over already scarce resources, such as land and water, and climate change threatens to increase such competition even further. It comes as no surprise, then, that many experts and governments expect natural resources to become key drivers in a growing number of disputes, with potentially significant consequences for international, regional, and national peace and security. In light of these risks, renewed attention needs to be paid to mechanisms for mitigating and resolving natural resource disputes. One particularly useful tool is mediation, which can be defined as a non-adversarial and collaborative process through which an impartial third party helps parties in a dispute reach a resolution through interest-based negotiations.

This guide seeks to demonstrate the value of mediation as an effective tool for resolving disputes around natural resources. Drawing from decades of hands-on mediation experience, it offers practical advice for mediation professionals and supporting institutions involved in localized or transboundary natural resource disputes, or those engaged in peace processes where natural resources play a critical role. As a starting point, it offers a structured methodology for mediating natural resource conflicts, which is divided into four phases: assessment; pre-negotiation preparedness; negotiation; and, implementation. Against this framework, the guide also examines sector-specific challenges that may arise when mediating conflicts over extractive resources, land, or water, and provides guidance on intervention strategies for natural resources in the broader context of peace negotiations.

The guide culminates with seven key messages for improving the practice of mediating disputes over natural resources:


	Context is extremely important
	Effective mediation requires a clear but nuanced mapping of actors and interests
	Equal access to impartial scientific and technical information about the resource in dispute is key
	Careful attention is needed to identify the stakeholders that should be engaged in the mediation process
	Mediation should aim for collaboration over shared benefits, which can generate the trust needed to tackle other issues
	Mediation techniques are available to overcome critical impasses and entrenched positions
	Natural resource issues in peace negotiations are frequently addressed to lay the foundation for future reforms, and not necessarily to resolve problems immediately

eldis:A62621;Land Grabbing in Africa and the New Politics of Food;;"Policy Brief 41
by Ruth Hall
'Africa is for sale’ is how some characterise it: there is a ‘land grab’ underway. Others are more cautious, speaking of ‘large-scale land acquisitions’, while the World Bank notes euphemistically the ‘rising global interest in farmland’. Whatever the prevailing terminology and ideologies, there is now ample evidence that large swathes of African farmland are being allocated to investors, usually on long-term leases, at a rate not seen for decades—indeed, not since the colonial period. The fact that much of this land is being acquired to provide for the future food and fuel needs of foreign nations has, not surprisingly, led to allegations that a neo-colonial push by more wealthy and powerful nations is underway to annex the continent’s key natural resources.

eldis:A25151;Settlement schemes for herders in the sub humid tropics of West Africa: issues of land rights and ethnicity;;Attempts at settling or sedentarizing nomadic herders in semi-arid and arid regions have been largely unsuccessful, partly on account of the difficulty of restricting the movements of domestic livestock in areas where low and irregular rainfall lead to scant and unreliable sources of water and grazing. But for the herders in sub-humid regions, where both water and vegetation resources are much more reliable and substantial, there appear to be different possibilities. This article evaluates the experience of a number of recent initiatives to settle nomadic herders in the subhumid zone of West Africa. In practice, however, numerous problems have been encountered and these are all the more striking in view of the general trend of migration towards and settlement in this region, by crop farmers and herders alike, which is independent of any state-planned initiative. ;C.

eldis:A27633;Differences between farmers and scientists in the perception of soil erosion: a South African case study;;Over the years agricultural scientists and extension agents have asked themselves why farmers do not take steps to control soil erosion, especially where such measures would appear to be cost-effective. Several explanations have been put forward, but thus far insufficient attention has been given to differences between scientists and farmers in their perception of the causes and effects of soil erosion. This is illustrated by a case study carried out in Zululand in South Africa.The case study revealed various differences between farmers and scientists in their perception of erosion. One basic difference centred on the perception of the environment as a whole. According to the scientists, there are sandy soils on the slopes and clayey soils with organic matter in the depressions, due to land formation and erosion processes. The farmers, however, believed that God had created the different soil types. Similarly, Lindskog and Tengberg  found that the Fulani in northern Burkina Faso did not believe that they themselves could influence the process, and accepted land degradation as an act of God (Allah). The perception of erosion is important for various reasons. Making the differences in perception explicit will facilitate the development of solutions satisfactory to all parties. Measures must be fully accepted by farmers if they are to be implemented, and this will involve a participatory process in which both scientists and farmers are involved from the start. Participatory studies on the perception of erosion can usefully be incorporated into the preparatory stage of soil and water conservation projects. [author] ;"S.C. van Dissel

The first section focuses on issues that relate to the transfer of forest rights to local people through Forest Land Allocation (FLA), including: an overview of FLA in Vietnam, a case study highlighting tensions that can arise between conservation and food security and a discussion of customary land rights of ethnic minorities. The second section discusses CFM in relation to two existing policy frameworks in Vietnam, Payment for Environmental Forest services (PEFS) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). It is argued that PEFS must be organized around CFM and REDD+ must employ an inclusive community-based approach. The final section examines how CFM can be improved in Vietnam. ;T.

eldis:A26213;Better Land Husbandry: Re-thinking approaches to land improvement and the conservation of water and soil;;Soil erosion has conventionally been perceived as the chief cause of land degradation, yet the limited effectiveness and poor uptake of widely promoted physical and biological anti-erosion methods challenges this logic. An alternative perception focusing on prior land damage - notably to soil cover, architecture and fertility - permits an holistic, farmer-centred approach which has generated positive response to date. ;"F.

eldis:A68477;Land use in a future climate agreement;;"This paper explores options for including land use in a future (post-2020) climate change agreement as anticipated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP). Options are considered with an eye toward reaching agreement under the ADP, keeping in mind the level of ambition of global efforts, and the need to accelerate the reduction of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The paper discusses the features of land use that have differentiated its treatment from that of other sectors and assesses options to address these features in a future agreement. It examines options to increase the coverage and mitigation effectiveness of land-use contributions, and explores requirements for increasing the clarity, transparency and understanding of these contributions. Finally, the paper examines options for creating incentives in the land-use sector that will increase mitigation ambition.

eldis:A70671;Freeport McMoran versus the People of Fungurume: How the largest mining investment in DRC has brought poverty not prosperity;;"The Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM) company controls a 1,600 square kilometre mining concession in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Tenke Fungurume deposits make up one of the most important reserves of copper and cobalt in the world with abundant quantities of high assay ore.

This report looks at a consultation with a wide range of officials, members of institutions, groups and organisations, and other interested individuals living in the concession area about the impact of the TFM mine on their lives and livelihoods.

Previously, the main source of income in the region was agricultural produce. However, farmers have lost their fields – without adequate compensation in most cases – and now struggle to find good vacant land for their crops because almost all the most fertile agricultural land is located within the concession area, and TFM does not allow the former owners to farm there.


The same problem applies to artisanal miners, who are denied access to the source of their livelihoods. People living within the concession even have trouble collecting stone or wood for construction because everything – even natural resources like rocks and trees – belongs to TFM.

This loss of traditional livelihoods has not been compensated for sufficiently by the provision of extra funds or of jobs on the mine. Indeed, the general expectation that TFM would employ local labour and use local contractors does not appear to have been met.

Recommendations to TFM


	TFM must improve its consultation with the local population to ensure that social projects have a long-term positive impact on surrounding communities
	TFM must increase the transparency of the Social Development Fund and directly involve the population in decision-making
	TFM must urgently close down Camp Bravo to ensure employees live with the local community and to boost the local economy
	TFM must favour the emergence of a local middle class by granting sub-contracts to local operators
	TFM must give the inhabitants access to fertile agricultural land for their subsistence and encourage local agricultural production and co-operatives
	TFM must allow the inhabitants to collect local construction materials such as stone and wood

eldis:A25487;Roads, population pressures and deforestation in Thailand, 1976 - 1989;;"Population pressures play less of a role in deforestation than earlier studies of Thailand found. Between 1976 and 1989, Thailand lost 28 percent ofits forest cover. To analyze how road building, population pressure,and geophysical factors affected deforestation in Thailand during that period, Cropper, Griffiths, and Mani develop a model in whichthe amount of land cleared, the number of agricultural households,and the size of the road network are jointly determined.The model assumes that the amount of land cleared reflects an equilibrium in the land market. Hence, in the long run, the amount cleared depends on the profitability of agriculture and on the longrun costs of clearing. The size of the country'sagricultural population, as well as the size of the road network,affects the demand for cleared land and hence the amount cleared in equilibrium.The authors estimate an equation to explain the amount of land cleared in equilibrium, using data for the 58 provincesthat were forested in 1973. Data from five years (1976, 1978,1982, 1985, and 1989) are combined to estimate the equilibriummodel.They find that the number of agricultural households and road density both increase the fraction of each provinced cleared, but their effects are small. The elasticity of cleared land with respect to agricultural households is only 0.12; with respect to road density, it is only 0.26.These effects do differ by region, however; moreover,the elasticities of forest area with respect to population density and road density are larger in absolute value than the respective elasticities for cleared land. The elasticity of forest to total area with respect to population density is 0.41 for the North/Northeastsection of the country and 0.22 for the South/Central region.The corresponding elasticities with respect to road density are0.20 and 1.09.This suggests that population pressures play less of a role in deforestation than earlier studies of Thailand found.For an area to remain deforested, it must be profitable to convert the land to another use, and that use is usually agriculture. Steep slopes and poor soil quality provide some natural protectionfor forests, although the quantitative impact of those factorsvary. Variations in agricultural prices also affect the amount of deforestation.This paper - a product of the Environment, Infrastructure,and Agriculture Division, Policy Research Department - is partof a larger effort in the department to understand the forces affecting land use change.

eldis:A26350;How Rural Market Imperfections Shape the Relation Between Farm Size and Productivity: a General Framework and an Application to Pakistani Data;;The subject of this article is the alleged inverse relationship between farm size and productivity in developing countries. The recent controversy is reviewed, and a framework is provided to explain the inverse relationship based on plausible assumptions about imperfections in the markets for labor, credit and land. On this basis testable hypotheses are derived. Using farm-level panel data from Pakistan, the framework is assessed by regressing output on operational farm size, size of owned holding, family size, tenurial status and irrigation status of the land. Household fixed effects are used to account for remaining unobserved heterogeneity. It is concluded that an inverse relationship is present in Pakistan, and that the market imperfections framework performs well with the data.

eldis:A35494;Climate change and rural livelihoods in Malawi: review study report of Norwegian support to FAO and SCC in Malawi, with a note on some regional implications;;This review seeks to assess the sustainable livelihoods projects currently supported by Norway in Malawi within the context of climate change and its predicted impact on agriculture development and food security.The report found that since the adaptation to climate change was not a design feature of any of the projects or undertakings, the relevance of the activities to adaptation to climate change was rather incidental. It argues that many activities aimed at better land management, more robust agricultural production systems, and community awareness and participation may also be important ingredients of projects specifically designed with climate change in mind. However, the report pointed out that some production-oriented interventions, e.g. higher production rates from long duration maize or specialised maize production at the expense of subsidiary crops (sorghum, millet, legumes, and vegetables) may render the farming systems significantly more vulnerable to adverse weather assumed to become increasing associated with climate change. Furthermore the report states that the projects reviewed seem to have considerable more understanding of the potential strengths of diversification than major government agricultural support programmes, yet often fall outside current subsidy schemes covering fertilizer and seed distribution. Lastly the report raises some concern as to whether the multitude of initiatives forwarded by institutions within and beyond the UN system to the Malawian government, and often driven by donor perspectives, may lead to fragmentation of efforts. At a country level, there is need to collaborate and establish an effective grouping involving development partners, farmer association, research institutions and government departments. This is where the Norwegian embassy could play a funding role for improved rural livelihoods.  ;"S. W. Bie

eldis:A29535;Herders and common property in evolution: an example from central Italy;;This article discusses the transhumant pastoralists of the Abruzzo highlands of central Italy. The article indicates that this system of production depended, and still depends, on the availability of communal grazing areas where access is open to all local residents and management is joint. The article discusses the relationship between herders, common property  regimes and the State.The article concludes that:as a pastoral system increases in complexity, from being a self contained CPR to an outward-looking one, with moveable assets and flocks, transaction costs increase. The State can assist in lowering transaction costsState assistance can be pitched at multiple levels and should be flexibleif the State is to provide a variety of duties, affordably, for small decentralised constituencies, then there must be an organisation or network connecting several CPRs in order that they function as a partner to State actionthe EU in particular has role in coordinating herders from different regions.

eldis:A16984;The impact of HIV AIDS on land rights: case studies from Kenya;;"This study explores the relationship between HIV/AIDS and land rights in Kenya, with a particular focus on women as a socially vulnerable group.  It examines: the ways that HIV/AIDS-affected households are coping in terms of land access, use and management; the consequences of these coping strategies on security of access and rights to land; and how changes in land tenure, access and rights to land among different categories of people are affecting agricultural productivity, food security and poverty.  The report also explores the future policy implications for land tenure arrangements for HIV/AIDS-affected households and identifies policy interventions for securing land rights of people affected by HIV/AIDS.Recommendations for legislative considerations focus on the land-tenure insecurities of women and children as vulnerable groups, and under-used agricultural land in areas badly hit by HIV/AIDS.  Although the existing land registration process and dispute regulation serves vulnerable groups to a certain extent, the study identifies a number of shortcomings which need to be addressed. Finally, the study makes a number of recommendations for consciousness raising, including: a proactive communications policy; training on land policy, procedures, rights, gender equality, HIV/AIDS and stigma; and developing regulations to guide and monitor land officials’ performance.

eldis:A13691;Rights talk and rights practice: challenges for Southern Africa;;"This research in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe looks at  the practice of rights claiming on the ground, in the context of 'legal pluralism' and complex, politicised institutional settings. In the southern African context rights are formulated and claimed in a very unlevel playing field and are highly contested. In practice rights are realised through complex negotiations about access to resources at a local level. Broader rights frameworks enshrined in the constitution, in legislation and in policy can - despite their progressive nature - be irrelevant, unless the local institutional context is conducive to encouraging effective rights claiming by poor people. A rights-based approach for sustainable livelihoods must therefore concentrate on institutional mechanisms for gaining access to resources, rather than only on establishing universalised legalistic rights frameworks.This paper concludes that: rights-based approaches may open up opportunities for improved access to resources (as in the water sector reforms in South Africa and Zimbabwe) but only if the relevant support and capacity is there.  In  tandem  with  legislative reform,  greater  investment  in institutional development is required. Changing the law is clearly not enough, although an important first stepa conventional Western-liberal, individualist approach to rights is clearly inappropriate in many contexts in southern Africa. A  recognition of group or collective rights for instance around  land is an important  complement.  A broader definition of  rights,  based  on people's own conceptions, is therefore key, and this must incorporate cultural, religious and ethnic dimensions, as well as material needs. Appropriate legal mechanisms are required to  uphold  such  collectively-held  rights,  and  these  may  not  be  based  on  conventional private-property  rights  concepts.  However  (again  in  the  example  of  land)  it  is  not always possible or appropriate to legislate land rights and design administrative systems that account for the complexity, variability and fluidity of land-holding systems and emphasis needs to be placed  on  institutions and processes rather than formal legalistic  rights frameworksrecognising that the institutional context for rights claiming is complex and contested is an important, often missed, step. Ignoring power and politics in institutional design results in sure failure of rights claiming and capture by those with power and resources. Thus new  ""participatory""  institutions  may  be  far  from  that  in  reality,  as,  for  example,  in  the catchment councils of Zimbabwe or many ""community-based"" initiatives across the regionthe notion of rights to livelihood survival for the poor needs to be highlighted in the context of competing claims by different,richer, more powerful  actors.  But  upholding these rights against claims by others (powerful  private  sector  players,  state  officials demanding patronage, or ""traditional authorities"" seeking control, for example) requires a strong and effective mediator and arbiter on behalf of the poor and marginalised. Where the state is weak, not trusted, predatory and exploitative, or simply absent, a rights free-for-all will result potentially in the undermining of livelihoods of the poor. And, even if strong and effective, state intervention may undermine the flexibility and responsiveness of existing plural systemsreinforcing state capacity, competence and legitimacy, then, is a key component  of encouraging a rights-based approach. But support for effective, representative organisation and mobilisation is the other side of the equation in order to increase voice, demand and accountability.  This raises the  issue of language, communication and information,and, more generally, access of poor people in rural areas to the type of resources required to claim rights effectivelyCurrently in rural southern Africa, the prospect of a rights-based transformation of development practice seem remote in the extreme. The retreat of the state through neo-liberal economic reform  and  deconcentration, or its effective collapse, have fundamentally  undermined  the state's developmental capacity and responsiveness. The same donors who are now advocating a rights-based approach have been party to these changes, and will need to reconsider their strategy if the rhetorical claims of supporting rights and eliminating poverty are to have any impact on poor people's livelihoods.

eldis:A57303;The future of food and farming: challenges and choices for global sustainability;;"The global food system will experience an unprecedented combination of pressures over the next 40 years. Global population size will increase and competition for land, water and energy will intensify, while the effects of climate change will become increasingly apparent. Over this period, globalisation will continue, exposing the food system to novel economic and political pressures.This final report of the Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures Project argues that decisive action needs to take place now. The report identifies five considerable challenges ahead:

    balancing future demand and supply sustainably to ensure that food supplies are affordable
    ensuring that there is adequate stability in food supplies and protecting the most vulnerable from the volatility that does occur
    achieving global access to food and ending hunger
    managing the contribution of the food system to the mitigation of climate change
    maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while feeding the world.

 Priorities for action include:  

    spreading of best practice
    making sustainable food production central in development activities
    working on the assumption that there is little new land for agriculture
    ensuring long-term sustainability of fish stocks
    including the environment in food system economics
    reducing waste
    improving the evidence base upon which decisions are made and developing metrics to assess progress
    anticipating major issues with water availability for food production
    working to change consumption patterns
    empowering citizens.

eldis:A63221;Where the rain falls: climate change, food and livelihood security, and migration;;This comparative study highlights that rainfall variability and food insecurity are key drivers for human mobility. The empirical research is based on eight country case studies, including a 1,300 household survey and participatory research sessions involving 2,000 individuals. The results reveal that migration is an important risk management strategy for vulnerable households. Land scarce households trying to cope with food insecurity send migrants during the hunger season to find food or money to buy food. Migration is often temporary and seasonal, if migrants are successful, but can be permanent if options cannot be found to deal with rainfall variability and rural food insecurity. The report states that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities – both in terms of minimising pressure on vulnerable populations and providing adaptation options – must underlie policy negotiations on climate induced migration and subsequent implementation at all levels. ;K.

eldis:A26829;The Evolution of Poverty and Inequality in Indian Villages;;Continued agricultural growth and diversification into nonagricultural activities are essential if India is to continue reducing rural poverty. But policymakers hoping to alleviate rural poverty must also be aware of the causes and implications of persisting, if not increasing, inequality within villages.  Jayaraman and Lanjouw review longitudinal village studies from a variety of disciplinary perspectives to identify changes in living standards in rural India in recent decades. They scrutinize the main forces of economic change—agricultural intensification, changes in land relations, and occupational diversification—to explain changes in level and distribution of living standards in rural communities.  These forces of economic change appear to have offset or at least mitigated the pressure that growing populations can place on existing resources. But the decline in rural poverty has been slow and irregular at best. Nor is poverty reduction only a matter of economic development. For instance, the rural poor often attribute much of the improvement in their living conditions to reduced dependence on patrons.  There are few reports in village studies of particularly effective government policies aimed at reducing poverty. The long-term poor still tend to be from the disadvantaged castes and to live in households that rely on income from agricultural labor.  There is little evidence that inequalities within village communities have declined. In some cases improved material well-being of rural households has led to greater social stratification rather than less, with women and members of the lower castes suffering the consequences.  Such inequalities could limit how policy interventions or continued growth can reduce poverty further. Policymakers must ensure accountability to keep abuses—for example, the privileged classes directing all benefits to themselves—to a minimum. [author] ;"R. Jayaraman

eldis:A27146;New Institutional Economics: A Survey of Property Rights and Natural Resource Management [case study from Rajasthan];;In this paper, the results of a recent case study of forest conservation and management in Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, India are reported. Changes in  land use, grazing, household fuelwood collection and inadequate management institutions are identified as key factors causing forest degradation. The paper demonstrates that quantitative analysis, employing data from fairly large samples of  households and villages, is a useful supplement to the qualitative methods  dominating in studies of conservation and natural resource management institutions. The results question a number of common hypotheses and beliefs about             natural resource use and management institutions. Results show (1) that the poor are not the major agents of forest degradation, as often hypothesised (2) that distance from the Reserve is a major factor in determining use patterns, and that the   largest use pressure stems from villagers residing outside but close to the Reserve (3) that although fuelwood markets do not appear instrumental in forest degradation, markets for milk may be (4) that village population size and natural resource scarcity may not affect the likelihood of collective action in the way it is normally envisaged (5) that reliance on formal and informal village natural resource management institutions is insufficient to safeguard forests and commons from degradation. The analysis maps out the available win-win options for       simultaneously improving conservation and rural livelihoods, including substitution of farm-produced fodder and fuelwood for forest Resources.

eldis:A27147;Fuelwood Consumption and Forest Degradation: A Household Model for Domestic Energy Substitution in Rural India [Rajasthan];;Paper examines domestic energy supply and demand in Northwest India. A household model is set up to analyse the links between forest scarcity and household energy consumption, focusing on the substitution of fuels from the forests  and commons and the private domain. The model is estimated using recently collected data from villages bordering Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan, India. A novel maximum entropy approach is used for estimation. It is found that fuelwood collection time, household endowments of land, labor, livestock and trees and  village-level indicators of forest stock, access and management are significant for explaining fuel mix at the household level. Thus, households respond to forest scarcity and increased fuelwood collection time by substituting fuels from private sources for forest fuelwood. However, the magnitude of the response appears to be  too small to prevent current fuelwood collection practices from causing serious forest degradation. [author] ;"R. Heltberg

eldis:A29362;Women's land and property rights in situations of conflict and reconstruction;;Despite advances in the international rights regime, persistent discrimination evident in the customary laws which regulate women's status in most traditional societies was a constant factor across cultural, social and political divides. The case-histories and testimonies recorded by the Kigali Consultation provide an insight into changes in land and inheritance rights brought about by conflict and its attendant social disruptions. Out of the acute distress experienced by women caught up in such circumstances, has grown a new realisation by the women themselves of their resilience and strength in adversity. Their stories testify to a new determination to assert women's rights in their productive, reproductive and ownership roles, all three representing long-term investments in their future communities and societies.This report points in particular to the challenge of addressing inequalities that women face in land and inheritance rights. But it also presents us with many encouraging examples of success in doing so, including the importance of community development initiatives that work directly with women to solve local problems. And above all it underscores the vital importance of building sound institutions and equitable laws that can provide a dynamic and sustainable framework for men and women to work together rebuilding lives and livelihoods. ;;;United Nations Development Fund for Women ;eldis;01/01/2001;en;"land;land tenure;property rights;property;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A29362;http://www.unifem.undp.org/resources/landrights/;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unifem.undp.org%2Fresources%2Flandrights%2F;;;;"land;Conflict and security;Kigali;gender;Inheritance rights;land tenure;Agriculture and food;property rights;Postconflict reconstruction;Gender and conflict;men;Gender;Land tenure;property;conflict;women"

They also pose the question as to whether the revival of customary systems or the introduction of local Alternative Dispute Resolution Systems (ADRS) can offer protection against uncertainty and arbitrary dispossession.A series of policy implications are drawn from the research findings. For Ghana’s state court’s, these include:the magistrate’s courts are the key ‘front-line’ institutions at local and rural levels there is potential for state-supported and enforced Alternative Dispute Resolution Systems (ADRS).For the Côte d’Ivoire court system, policy implications include:courts are an alternative to political conflict as they could satisfy demands for impartial justice, provided enforcement was effectiveADRS will be difficult to develop but could be considered.The overall conclusion is that state courts serve a real need for authoritative remedies and should be enhanced and supported. The introduction of ADRS also needs state support. Customary or traditional justice systems have played a key role in protecting land rights where they have been legalised by the state, as in Ghana. ;"R. Crook

eldis:A70451;Conflict gold to criminal gold: the new face of artisanal gold mining in Congo;;"The objective of this research report was to establish whether, and to what extent, post-conflict efforts at national, regional and international levels are improving the situation of artisanal gold-mining communities in the provinces of Orientale, North and South Kivu, and Maniema in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The research proceeded from the assumption that legal and regulatory instruments and institutions created after the 2006 elections to regularise and support the DRC’s informal mining sector should now be starting to show positive effects. This report sought to verify that assumption.

Key recommendations


	stop the criminal exploitation of the gold-mining sector: the government must act to halt the increasingly criminal exploitation of artisanal and small-scale miners by a plague of government bureaucrats, officials and security agents – and end the illegal export of almost 100% of the gold produced in the east
	provide adequate physical protection to miners: if the government provided adequate physical protection to artisanal and small-scale miners – by reallocating funds to support legitimate army regiments – gold production would increase and so would the sector’s impact on individual livelihoods and the region’s economy
	Protect artisanal and small-scale gold miners from racketeers: the government needs to tackle the racketeers, who are buying the miners’ gold at unfairly low prices and selling them food, tools and other merchandise at hugely inflated prices – and leaving them constantly digging for survival
	reorganise or close SAESSCAM: the Service for the Assistance and Supervision of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (SAESSCAM) was established to support miners but its underpaid – or often unpaid – agents simply extort ‘taxes’, ‘levies’ and other ‘fees’ without providing any services in return. The government must totally restructure the institution or close it down

eldis:A17518;Establishing farm-based equity-share schemes in KwaZulu-Natal: lessons from USAID's BASIS research programme;;This proceedings issue from a mini conference held in November 2004 presents six papers summarising attempts to establish best practice equity-share schemes on two commercial farms in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The main object of this participatory research was to test and refine land reform policy influencing the role of equity-share schemes as instruments of land and agrarian reform in South Africa.The papers presented were as follows:Land redistribution in Kwazulu-Natal: an analysis of Farmland transactions from 1997 until 2002 by Stuart Ferrer and Allan Semalulu. Presents detailed estimates of the rate of land redistribution in KwaZulu-Natal over the period 1997-2002, and compares the performance of private and government-assisted land transactions with respect to the quantity and quality of land redistributed and the gender sensitivity of these transfers. Best institutional arrangements for farmworker equity-share schemes in South Africa by Sharon Knight, Michael Lyne and Michael Roth. Identifies best institutional practices for equity-share schemes using cluster analysis to group indicators of good project performance, sound institutional arrangements, effective worker empowerment and competent management observed in case studies conducted in the Western Cape during 2001 (KwaZulu-Natal had no equity-share schemes at that time).Design and implementation of an equity-share scheme on Sherwood farm in the midlands of Kwazulu-Natal by Peter Greene.  Explains the innovative organisational and financing arrangements developed for Sherwood farm and outlines policy and other problems that continue to hold up their implementation.Proposed establishment of Clavelshay equity-share scheme: securing residential rights for farmworkers by Kathy Pitout. Here, the equity-sharing scheme required relocation of farmworker homes. The farmer was willing to donate land to his workers but legislation governing the establishment of townships (and hence the award of housing grants) created prohibitively high costs when applied to a small rural development. Many opportunities for equity-sharing on commercial farms will be lost if the policy divide between land reform and housing is not bridged.Facilitating a farm based equity-share scheme: the case of Sherwood and the clipstone community by Nokulunga Ngobese.  Here the author drew on her personal experience to describe the facilitation process at Sherwood. Her paper considers the equity-sharing proposal from the perspective of a beneficiary household and shows how misconceptions can be corrected using appropriate methods to communicate difficult concepts.Measuring the performance of equity-share schemes as an instrument of agrarian reform in South Africa by Bernadine Gray. Looks to the future and considers the problem of measuring and monitoring the performance of equity-share schemes and discusses  performance indicators ranging from financial ratios to measures of poverty alleviation, empowerment and good governance. ;"M.

eldis:A38322;Global corruption report 2008: corruption in the water sector;;"Divided into three parts, this collaborative work looks at the varied challenges brought about as a result of corruption in the water sector. It also looks at recent research conducted and provides an overview of the water sector corruption challenges in country profiles across the globe. Corruption in the water sector puts the lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk. The onset of climate change and the increasing stress on water supply around the world make the fight against corruption in water more urgent than ever. Without increased advocacy to stop corruption in water, there will be high costs to economic and human development, the destruction of vital ecosystems, and the fuelling of social tension or even conflict over this essential resource. Corruption in water is a significant factor in the climate change agenda and therefore, also a critical issue for global public policy. The impact of corruption in the water sector on lives, livelihoods, food security and international cooperation also underscores the many linkages to global policy concerns. A number of lessons are highlighted from efforts in fighting water sector corruption across countries. These lessons and subsequent recommendations include: 

    prevent corruption in the water sector, as cleaning up after it is difficult and expensive - when corruption leads to contaminated drinking water and destroyed ecosystems, the detrimental consequences are often irreversible 
    understand the local water context, otherwise reforms will fail. One size never fits all in fighting corruption, but this is particularly the case in the water sector, where conditions of supply and demand, existing infrastructure and governance systems vary widely 
    cleaning up water corruption should not be at odds with the needs of the poor. The costs of corruption in the water sector are disproportionately borne by the poor. Pro-poor anti-corruption efforts should focus on the types of service provision that matter most to them, such as public standpipes or drilling rural wells 
    build pressure for water reform from above and from below - ending corruption in the water sector requires breaking the interlocking interests and relationships that are perpetuating the problem. Leadership from the top is necessary to create political will and drive institutional reform 
    scale up and refine the diagnosis of corruption in water – the momentum and effectiveness of reform depend on it. Tools such as corruption impact assessments and public expenditure tracking need to be refined, adopted widely across the water sector and adapted to specific local contexts to lay the foundations for targeted reform.

The project aims to identify the type and scale of national and sub-national programmes and projects that have been funded by climate finance and how they relate to local water security.

The case study report reviews the evidence base on water security and climate change for Zambia, and explores the nexus between the two thematic areas; reviews the policy and institutional frameworks for climate finance in Zambia, and sets out an analysis of the reported climate finance funds flowing from international donors. It then goes on to set out an analysis of the identified climate finance flows categorised in terms of their relevance to a hierarchy of water security issues and presents the study’s conclusions and recommendations.

eldis:A60488;Vulnerability of arid and semi-arid regions to climate change: impacts and adaptive strategies;;"This perspective document, part of the 16-paper series on water and climate change adaptation, focuses on the impacts and adaptive strategies in arid and semi-arid regions. The series reflect the central topic of the 5th World Water Forum, ‘climate change and adaptation’, where it was presented and discussed. The following risks posed by climate change to the water sector in arid regions are identified.

    New technologies have led to unsustainable extraction of ground water, leading to increased vulnerability to expected falls in precipitation.
    Consumption is set to rise as countries develop and populations grow.
    Food security is threatened as agriculture requires more water in line with temperature rise.
    Increased urbanisation will strain resources and increase vulnerability to flooding, energy-failure and heat-waves.
    Ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, face increased risk of fire and exploding pest numbers.
    Coastal areas, especially deltas and cities, are at risk of sea-level rise.
    Disease patterns are likely to change, making control more difficult.
    Implications of climate change will likely be gendered, with women and girls suffering disproportionately.
    Scarcity of resources and increased extreme weather (flooding/droughts) are likely to create and exasperate existing conflicts between communities.
    Water quality will be reduced due to pesticides, sediments and thermal pollution. 

Difficulties facing policy decisions are covered, such as the need for strong institutional capacities to implement adaptive strategies and the difficulties of allocating funding for projects that tackle such unpredictable risks. It is urged that more funding be found for research and data collection so that this issue is mitigated. The paper then provides examples of adaptive strategies that are being planned or implemented around the world. From water allocation in the Nile Delta to glacial retreat in Ecuador, from irrigation management in Pakistan to information management in Spain, numerous examples are presented where government and communities are utilising modern technology to collect data and inform policy. Successful systems are found to contain the essential elements of assessment, bargaining, codification, delegation, engineering and feedback; these are explained in further depth. The paper includes following conclusions.

    Arid and semi-arid areas must implement adaptive strategies regarding water.
    Systemic collection and sharing of data is essential and governments must be made aware of its value.
    Training should be provided to enhance institutional capacity of water managers in developing countries. 
    Irrigation infrastructure must be protected and improved.

eldis:A17290;Land, violent conflict and development;;"This paper looks at the dynamics of land and violent conflict. It states that conflict situations in rural societies deeply affect the politics of land, and that land requires a careful approach by policy makers because it is a central element in the evolution of societies. As a result, policies pertaining to land are not neutral in terms of conflict management.The paper argues that donors seeking to promote peace and development should tackle land issues in recipient countries more systematically, more carefully and in a more coherent manner. Conversely, land policy should carefully take sensitivities and grievances into account, in order to better monitor the risks of violent conflict.Recommendations on donor approaches and tools include:donors’ conflict-prevention programmes aiming to sustain peace in immediate post-conflict settings tend to neglect land issues. Similarly, land policy projects often neglect the conflict dimensiondonors should pay attention early on to the political dynamics that may impede the implementation of their institution-building programmesdonors should improve their ability to monitor potential land-incited conflict and to look for early warning signs; land issues should always be included in assessments of pre- and post-conflict vulnerabilitiesbetter co-ordination among and within donor agencies is crucial, and requires that they combine traditionally separate programmatic domains, for example, economic growth, governance, and rural development. Political impact assessments could be used to identify areas where co-ordination is most needed in order to prevent counter- effectsbest practices to deal with open or hidden political conflicts include participatory approaches and comprehensive stakeholder dialogue. Donors need to engage all stakeholders in land related conflicts, as they do in helping to resolve broader conflicts. ";"N. Pons-Vignon

eldis:A39445;Future forestry education. Responding to expanding societal needs;;"Forestry education in recent years has largely failed to adequately respond to the dynamics in forestry practice, the demands of the job market and the challenges of new global forestry paradigms. 
This policy brief consolidates recommendations of the first global workshop on forestry education held in September 2007, at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) in Nairobi, Kenya. Attended by 85 participants from 29 countries representing Africa, Asia, North and South America and Europe, the workshop deliberated on vital issues for guiding, coordinating and linking relevant institutions and stakeholders in the process of transforming forestry education. They agreed that: 

    increased investment in forestry capacity is imperative 
    improved coordination mechanisms are key at national, regional and global scales to reinforce the quality and content of forestry education and training 
    enhanced harmonisation of forestry with other related sectors is needed in order to achieve synergy of strategies and actions 
    regional and global mechanisms for collaboration in forestry education be established and sustained 

The brief asserts that major changes in forestry education, research and practice are urgently needed to improve relevance and popularise forest science, technologies and practices. Obvious implications for neglecting forestry education are noted as:  

    schools of forestry will continue to produce inadequate graduates, lacking the required expertise to handle the emerging complex societal and environmental challenges 
    forestry professional ethics could deteriorate further, leading to indiscriminate destruction of natural resources the backbone of human livelihood 
    due to the link between agriculture and forestry, the destruction of forests may lead to water flow challenges impacting on food security
    our knowledge and capacity to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change will remain weak, further accelerating global warming, flash floods and droughts 
    further losses of biodiversity will deny the world of important plants and animals with the potential to solve health and other problems

eldis:A15134;Time for transparency: coming clean on oil, mining and gas revenues;;This report explores how, across the world, the revenues from oil, gas and mining that should be funding sustainable economic development have often been misappropriated and mismanaged. Specifically, it analyses five major examples of this problem: Kazakhstan, Congo Brazzaville, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Nauru.The report argues that in these countries, governments do not provide even basic information about their revenues from natural resources. Nor do oil, mining and gas companies publish any information about payments made to governments. Huge amounts of money are therefore not subject to any oversight and crooked elites can extract all sorts of ‘facilitation payments’ from firms that would probably prefer not to pay bribes. Ordinary citizens, who often own a country’s resources under its constitution, are thus left without the information to call their governments to account over the management of their revenues. The end result is a litany of corruption, social decay, increased poverty, reinforcement of authoritarian government and political unrest, which can ultimately lead to state failure and the spread of instability across regions.Recommendations to increase the transparency of natural resource revenues include:all resource-rich developing countries and resource extraction companies should actively participate in the UK government’s Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and seek to voluntarily disclose their revenues from resource extraction. However, voluntary disclosure will not work everywhere that transparency is most needed because many political and business elites have a vested interest in avoiding transparency to protect their illicit profitsa set of joined-up policies is needed to make resource extraction companies publish what they pay to governments on a country-by-country basis and to make host governments publish what they earnsimple adjustments to existing policies of company disclosure, ‘books and records’ provisions in anti-corruption legislation, and international accounting standards can be used to require multinational companies to ‘publish what they pay’export credit agencies, bilateral and multilateral bodies, and banks should make all their lending ;;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"mining;extractive industries";;;"AGO;GNQ;UKR;KGZ;202;RUS;MDA;030;BLR;009;TJK;TKM;UZB;KAZ;ARM;NRU";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A15134;http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/115/en/time_for_transparency;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Fmedia_library_detail.php%2F115%2Fen%2Ftime_for_transparency;;;;"Natural resource revenue;oil;Congo Brazzaville;Private sector corruption;Good Governance;gas;Governance;Business and corruption;Extractive industries mining;Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;natural resources;Good governance corruption;Extractive industries oil;Extractive industries;transparency"
eldis:A15135;AIDS and female property/inheritance rights;;This fact sheet explores the issue of women’s property and inheritance rights and its relationship with HIV/AIDS.It argues that while property and inheritance rights are important for women generally, they take on dramatically increased importance in the context of HIV and AIDS. Reasons for this include:upholding female property and inheritance rights helps mitigate negative economic consequences of AIDS experienced by women and their households upholding female property and inheritance rights can help prevent the spread of HIV by promoting women’s economic security and empowerment, thereby reducing their vulnerability to domestic violence, unsafe sex, and other AIDS-related risk factorsdiscriminatory inheritance practices have negative consequences for AIDS-affected households: widows suffer partial or total loss of assets, including their land and homes, to relatives of the deceased spouse leaving such households destitute and more vulnerable to further consequences of HIV and AIDSGuaranteeing women’s property and inheritance rights in the context of HIV and AIDS requires both global and country-level actions. Successful action should focus on five key areas:documenting women’s land and housing rights and tenure security in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areasraising public education and awareness, especially among national policy makers and donorsreforming legislation, including customary law and practiceidentifying strategic litigation opportunities, especially improving legal skills, establishing legal precedents through test cases, improving the court system, and ensuring women’s access to legal structures and processesidentifying and supporting experimentation within communities to change economic and institutional arrangements including initiatives that seek to support the collective ownership or lease rights to land and establishing land trusts for AIDS orphans[adapted from author] ;;;Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"property;property rights;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A15135;http://www.unaids.org/html/pub/una-docs/gcwa_property_02feb04_en_pdf.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unaids.org%2Fhtml%2Fpub%2Funa-docs%2Fgcwa_property_02feb04_en_pdf.pdf;;;;"Economic insecurity;Gender and HIV AIDS;Inheritance rights;Gender;HIV and AIDS;Agriculture and food;Women and girls;Health;aids;Social determinants of health;HIV and AIDS treatment and care;property rights;HIV;vulnerability;Land tenure"
eldis:A75597;Why is prior consultation not yet an effective tool for conflict resolution? The case of Peru;;"This Working Paper from the German Institute of Global and Area Studies argues that new legislation in Peru will not help to turn prior consultations into a tool for conflict resolution as long as the normative framework itself is contested and the necessary basic conditions are not in place.

Prior consultation is an increasingly accepted instrument internationally for guaranteeing the rights of indigenous peoples. Conceived of theoretically as a means for conflict resolution, in practice it lies at the heart of social conflicts all over Latin America. Using concepts from the “contentious politics” approach, the authors take a closer look at Peru – where indigenous mobilisations would lead to the only Latin American consultation law enacted to date. They also critically analyse the content and formulation of its regulating norm. They argue that this new legislation will not help to turn such consultations into a tool for conflict resolution as long as the normative framework itself is contested and the necessary basic conditions are not in place. The most important conditions that they identify for implementing effective prior consultation are impartial state institutions capable of justly balancing the diverse interests at stake, measures that reduce power asymmetries within consultations, and joint decision?making processes with binding agreements.

eldis:A9335;Reducing conflict and improving resource management for Kenyan pastoralists;;Governments and scientists have long regarded the pastoralists’ way of life as a cause of environmental degradation. This belief is rooted in a misunderstanding of the pastoralist way of life and is reflected in national policies on land tenure and resource access in Kenya. The area of land controlled by pastoralists has been steadily reduced, and pastoralists have been encouraged to give up their nomadic way of life and settle, leading to conflict between pastoralist groups and other land users and damage to the environment. ;Rachel Berger;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"environment;natural resources management;pastoralists";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";Land Use, Management & Investment;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A9335;http://www.id21.org/nr/r2rb1g1.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fnr%2Fr2rb1g1.html;;;;"Environment;natural resources;NRM;resource management Kenya;natural resources management;degradation;peace building;livelihood security;Agriculture and food;pastoralism;conflict resolution;erosion;Pastoralism;conflict"

In some areas, traditional access and ownership rights for women, migrants and pastoralists have been ignored or reduced.  The rise of HIV/AIDS in the region has created new social groups who are vulnerable to discrimination by land policies. As new policies are formed in the region, it is important to consider why these groups have been excluded. This will help to ensure that future policies represent these groups more fairly. ;"Lorenzo Cotula

The literatures on tenure issues and food security issues are not well connected and the scientific evidence on the causal links between tenure security and food security is very limited. The paper explores the conceptual linkages between land tenure reforms, tenure security and food security and illustrates how these vary across diverse contexts. The paper then reviews the limited number of high quality studies that contribute to a causal chain analysis between tenure security and food security and identifies important research gaps. ;"S.T.

Data from 15,000 smallholders and 800 estates in Malawi allow exploring the long-term effects of such a strategy. The results suggest that (i) most estates are less productive than smallholders; (ii) fear of land loss, although not exclusively due to estates, is associated with a 12 percent productivity loss for females, which is large enough to finance a low-cost tenure regularization program; and (iii) failure to collect realistic land rents implies public revenue losses of up to US$50 million per year.

It is therefore important to preserve forests for water management. Previous efforts to protect forests in Ecuador have relied on controlling land use and excluding local people. These methods often have limited success, because of problems such as corruption and a lack of enforcement. A new approach is to pay people to protect the forests. People who benefit from the services the forest provide - such as clean water - make payments to those who look after the forests. ;"Marta Echavarria

For example, the paper by Muniruzzaman ilustrates how water ignores political and community boundaries, and how decisions in one place can significantly affect water use elsewhere. India’s plans to build more dams could, for instance, have devastating affects for Pakistan’s agricultural productivity which is highly dependent on water supply from the Indus River. The paper also identifies three ways in which climate change can affect human migration: warming climate will reduce the agricultural potential in some regions undermining core ecosystem services; increasing extreme weather events will generate mass displacement; sea-level rise will destroy the low-lying coastal areas forcing millions of people to relocate permanently.

eldis:A28340;Sustaining livelihoods on Mongolia's pastoral commons;;Under the socialist regime that prevailed until the start of the 1990s, Mongolia made great progress in improving human development indicators, and poverty was virtually unknown. Through innovative service delivery mechanisms to nomadic pastoralists, almost universal coverage of primary health care services was achieved and adult literacy reached 97%.Political and economic transition in the 1990s ushered in a rapid rise in asset and income inequality, and a third of the population have been defined as living below the poverty line since 1995. The dramatic shake-out of labor from uneconomic state-owned enterprises has been absorbed largely by the extensive livestock sector in rural areas and the growing informal economy in urban areas. A dramatic reversal in net rural to urban migration led to a doubling in the number of herding households between 1992 and 1997, which now account for around half the population, herding more livestock on Mongolia’s pastoral commons than ever before in recorded history.In such a context, sustainable management of the pastoral commons is central to the mainstream challenge of national economic development. This paper presents preliminary results from a country-wide participatory poverty assessment, which seeks to elicit people’s own experiences of poverty, well-being and deprivation in a rapidly changing economic environment.Drawing on a blend of quantitative and qualitative data, it describes the main elements of an integrated approach to building secure and sustainable livelihoods both on and off the pastoral commons. Adoption of the ‘sustainable livelihoods’ lens draws attention to the full range of assets and capabilities that the poor may potentially command (including human, social and natural capital as well as physical and financial capital), and to the importance of strategies to reduce or manage the risks and vulnerabilities that poor households face.[author] ;"R.

eldis:A26505;Logs or Local Livelihood?:  The Case for Legalizing Community Control of Forest Lands in Ratanakiri, Cambodia;;A recent eighteen-month economic study of the benefits of alternative uses of forest and in Ratanakiri province recommends the exclusion of customary forest land from current and future commercial concessions. The study compares the economic benefits of using forest land in Ratanakiri for the traditional collection of non-timber forest products by ethnic communities, with the benefits of commercial timber harvesting.  The main conclusions of the study are that non-timber forest products (NTFP) are worth a lot, much more than previously thought. These products are very important to the poorest sectors of society. Any land use planning process that ignores these values can lead to a loss of economic value for Cambodia and even to increased security problems and conflicts in the province. Furthermore, there is clear evidence that local communities have the capability and knowledge to sustainably manage their customary forests themselves. Conversely, large scale commercial interests in the area currently threaten the environmental stability and rich cultural heritage of the area. ;C.

These new guidelines by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) outline principles and practices that governments can refer to when making laws and administering land, fisheries and forests rights. The guidelines cover a wide range of issues, including promoting equal rights for women in securing title to land, creating transparent record-keeping systems that are accessible to the rural poor, and recognising and protecting informal and traditional rights to land, forests and fisheries. ;;;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;eldis;01/01/2012;en;"food security;climate change;land use;research;fisheries;land";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A61492;http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/nr/land_tenure/pdf/VG_Final_May_2012.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fao.org%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_upload%2Fnr%2Fland_tenure%2Fpdf%2FVG_Final_May_2012.pdf;;;;"Climate change poverty and vulnerability;Climate change Fisheries;Climate change agriculture and food security;Land use;REDD;Climate change gender;Climate change Forestry;Climate change;tfmimport;research"
eldis:A65233;Reframing the New Alliance Agenda: A Critical Assessment based on Insights from Tanzania;;"Through the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, in 2013 G8 countries are seeking to mobilise the private sector and multi-national corporations to boost African agriculture. This new Future Agricultures / PLAAS briefing (pdf) looks at how African countries are engaging with the New Alliance. The authors argue that large-scale acquisitions of land for corporate agriculture, which may result from New Alliance projects, pose a serious challenge for local markets and smallholder farmers. Underlying assumptions, about the effectiveness of technology transfer and boosting productivity to address food shortages, need to be challenged. With insights from the Southern Agriculture Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT), the authors recommend how African countries could reframe their approaches to support food production and rural communities, including


	securing tenure rights and access to strategic resources in line with the FAO’s Voluntary Guidelines
	improving land and other governance institutions to ensure transparency and accountability
	investing in smallholder farmers through extension services, inputs and access to markets.

eldis:A66103;China’s economic statecraft and African mineral resources: changing modes of engagement;;"China’s impressive inroads into Africa’s resources sectors over the past decade are explained largely by the timely match between a cash-loaded China in search of raw materials and a continent with a vast pool of underdeveloped mineral deposits, exploration of which has been hindered for decades by underinvestment and infrastructure bottlenecks.  Chinese ‘infrastructure-for-resources’ loans are ultimately a product of the convergence of Chinese and African interests at the dawn of the 21st century. This loan formula, swapping infrastructure for resources, came into being largely as a default strategy, inspired by China’s own domestic experience, its competitive advantages and African receptiveness to this kind of barter deal.  The paper explores how China has consistently used this approach over the past decade as a positive economic statecraft tool to pursue mineral resources security goals in Africa; and how the need to adjust its approach to challenges and new opportunities on the ground has led to noticeable shifts in recent years. It argues that, although infrastructure for resources remains an important tool to meet Beijing’s supply concerns, China’s strategies to access resource assets have become more diversified and market oriented, with its stateowned enterprises taking the lead and engaging increasingly in mergers and acquisitions.

eldis:A28003;Conservation, reclamation and grazing in the northern Negev:  Contradictory or complementary concepts?;;Paper explores the relationships between the following concepts under the conditions of Middle Eastern semi-arid ecosystems. Paper states that there are two apparent contradictions in the title of this paper. First, grazing by domestic  livestock is often considered to be hostile to nature conservation, especially in semi-arid areas (the ongoing conflict between ranchers and environmentalists in western USA is just one contemporary example of this). Second, the aims of conservation and development (in the sense of reclamation) would also appear to be contradictory, since the latter concerns changing or manipulating the natural environment, while the former would tend to exclude or prevent it. ;A.

eldis:A23817;Awareness raising workshop on the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification;;This paper presents the proceedings of a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) held in December 2005. The report presents the workshop programme, objectives and methodology. Four papers were presented at the workshop, ensuing discussions by the participants are also included. The papers discuss:desertification as the foremost environmental issue in Sudanthe history, objectives, principles and importance of the UNCCDSudan’s National Action Plan (NAP) and implementation mechanismthe integration and linkages between UNCCD/NAP with Sudan’s development policies and programmes.Four working groups discussed:identification of the role and commitments of the national parliamentarians establishing the implementation mechanism of the NCCD/NAPintegration of the NAP in Sudan’s development strategies, policies and programmesto set time frames for the revision and finalisation of the NAP, establishment of the implementation mechanism, and integration of the NAP in Sudan’s development strategies.The document concludes that the workshop was a breakthrough in that it was the first time that legal and political representatives were engaged to support efforts for combating desertification in the Sudan. The workshop strongly recommended the finalisation of the NAP to counter desertification and the creation of an enabling environment for its implementation and follow-up through strong political and financial support. The workshop also emphasised the critical roles of all stakeholders, in particular civil society organisations and local communities, in implementing the NAP through partnerships, as well as the crucial need for raising awareness at all levels about the UNCCD and the NAP. ;"A.A.

eldis:A35425;Water, land and people: a learning initiative implemented in Bolivia, Mali and India;;"This document reports on findings from learning groups relating to water management in Bolivia, India and Mali during 2005-2006. The groups analysed specific topics with the aim of improving the current and future development strategies of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). In each of the three countries, the learning group identified key topics to address – equity, empowerment and environmental sustainability were identified as cross-cutting issues. The learning process resulted in products that can be used as a resource base at different levels including local, national, policy and wider public. Key lessons include: 

    where there are changes on the use of land, conflicts occur due to water access when the systems are not planned with a multiple use vision 
    the availability of the water resource is integral to the development of women’s organisations – allowing the creation of substantial incomes for families and communities 
    it is time to shift focus from development to management of water resources by improving water management mechanisms to address competition for a finite resource such as groundwater. 

Whilst the ‘learning process’ demonstrated that: 

    story-telling is an innovative learning tool – it allowed participants to break out of the usual more formal setting, seeing complex issues from previously unperceived angles 
    the learning process is most effective and motivating if intermediate results are produced and immediately used as inputs for decision-making and in other learning initiatives 
    the stakeholders should own the learning process but this can only be achieved if they are involved right from the planning stage.

eldis:A74271;Soil carbon management in large-scale Earth system modelling: implications for crop yields and nitrogen leaching;;"Results demonstrate that the effects of management on cropland can be beneficial for carbon and nutrient retention without risking (large) yield losses.

Nevertheless, effects on soil carbon are small compared with extant stocks in natural and semi-natural ecosystem types and managed forests.

While agricultural management can be targeted towards sustainable goals, from a climate change or carbon sink perspective avoiding deforestation or reforestation constitutes a far more effective overall strategy for maintaining and enhancing global carbon sinks.

However, enhanced carbon storage in agricultural soils could also be seen as a surrogate for enhanced soil structure and reduced erosion having additional (non-climate) environmental benefits.

eldis:A71215;Mainstreaming climate-sensitive indicators into an existing food monitoring system: climate change and food security in Nepal ;;"In 2011, the Government of Nepal made its policy on climate change public. The policy envisions a country “spared from the adverse impacts of climate change, by considering climate justice, through the pursuit of environmental conservation, human development, and sustainable development [with] all contributing toward a prosperous society”. This objective of making Nepal and Nepali society more resilient to climate change is laudable, especially as emerging evidence suggests that Nepal and its people are likely to be very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

This report encapsulates findings of a year-long study that proposes mainstreaming climate sensitive food security indicators into Nepal Khadhya Surakshya Anugaman Pranali-NeKSAP (Nepal Food Security Monitoring System). The study uses series of consultations with World Food Programme WFP-Nepal functionaries to review indicators obtained from global literature and NeKSAP. The study analyses NeKSAP and proposed 28 indicators to assess vulnerabilities to climate change. The 28 indicators are to be used with Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) and administered at the household level. The set of 28 indicators were pre-tested, administered and the data obtained analysed for ranking vulnerability. In addition, the study proposes 15 district level indicators referred to as Climate-Sensitive Food Security Indicators (CLIFSI).

The use of CLIFSI data helps rank Nepal’s region in assessing vulnerability to climate change. By incorporating CLIFSI, NeKSAP will be strengthened and become useful for planning and policy making in relation to climate change vulnerabilities. The paper concludes by stating that relevant agencies will find CLIFSI useful as a decision support tool to design strategies for building resilient food systems as well as to develop the capacity of local households to overcome food insecurity.

eldis:A70777;Mediating land conflict in Burundi: a documentation and analysis project;;"Mediating Land Conflict in Burundi: A Documentation and Analysis Project was an assessment and evaluation project undertaken by ACCORD between July 2009 and February 2010. The purpose of the project was twofold. First, it explored how land conflict mediation addresses or relates to other more long-term challenges for peace in Burundi – principally, the utilisation of land and increasing access to sustainable livelihoods. In this context, emphasis was put on the triple-R challenges of the repatriation and reintegration of returnees, and reconciliation between different Burundian societal groups. Second, the project documented and analysed ACCORD’s land conflict mediation practice in the two Burundi provinces of Bururi and Ruyigi.

To this end, the following questions were answered:


	in what ways do the activities of ACCORD Legal Aid Clinics contribute to the sustainable resolution of land disputes? What are the different types of solutions found? Are they sustainable?
	what effect does ACCORD’s mediation work have on the reintegration of returnees and the reconciliation process in Burundi

eldis:A28861;Forest cleansing: racial oppression in scientific nature conservation;;"Article looks at a specific case of racial oppression manifesting itself within development programs. At a more general level, the article looks at how ecological project can become politicised.An example of this is South-East Asia, where valley-based states have regularly attempted to sedentarize or repress hill-dwelling ethnic minorities. Racist patterns and processes in the region have been sustained and strengthened through the activities of international environmentalists and developmentalists. The potential for racial violence in the region is exemplified by a current conflict over water and forests in Chom Thong, a district in Chiang Mai province of Northern Thailand. Here, over the past decade, elite conservationists, state bureaucracies and politicians have helped each other exploit, rework and augment a legacy of highland-lowland ethnic tensions in the course of pressing for resettlement of mountain communities on ""environmental"" grounds and for greater elite and state control over mountain resources.The establishment by Thai elites, under the tutelage of US and other international conservationists, of parks and wildlife reserves has helped to entrench an upland vs lowland ethnic grid. A simplified people-vs.-trees narrative of forest decline was superimposed on the realities of forest history, making it possible to reinterpret the character and persistence of highland forests as a result of the relative absence of human influence rather than of human stewardship or commercial inaccessibility. In an irony often noted by minority observers, the disproportionate survival of good forest in minority-occupied areas was transformed into a reason for evicting minorities.Physical violence against mountain minorities, much of it unreported, has been an integral part of their increased stigmatization and scapegoating. The violence is directed, again following the standard racist dualism, at either removal or assimilation.Certain conservation organisations involved in this issue have mobilised ethnic divisions in the service of ""forest conseration"" and centralisation through:Physical exclusionConceptual exclusion from the Thai nationDivision of minority groups from each otherDissemination of racial stereotypesConcludes:Throughout their existence, campaigns to dispossess hill-dwelling minorities in Thailand have tapped the power of international racist science and development discourseUnderstanding environmental racism means paying attention both to the uniqueness of particular cases and to wider parallels. Examples such as the one explored in this article provide rich materials for understanding evolving patterns of ethnic violence and their links both to local and regional inter-class politics and resource competition and to structures of racism embedded in international science and mainstream environmentalism ";L.

The author argues that the limits of law to address displacement and dispossession are not due to a lack of institutionalising international good governance norms into domestic-level legal frameworks. Nor can the limits be attributed to state incapacity. Rather, the limits of law lie within the norm implementation process, wherein norms are conditioned by the local Mozambican governance context to serve domestic interests.

eldis:A101927;Tribal representation & local  land governance in India: A case study from the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya;;In India, the Schedule Tribes have remained on the fringes of growth, but less so in the majority tribal areas of the North East. This has increased the interest in the Sixth Schedule, the special constitutional provision relating to these areas, recognising the tribal communities’ rights of ownership and control over their land and natural resources. These communities have the advantage of protective provisions against ‘external threats’ from the state or private actors, compared to their tribal counterparts in other areas.  This article presents a case study of the socio-political dynamics of community ownership and control of land in the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. It shows how land loss and marginalisation of families occurred in relation with a state-led township project around the capital Shillong, bringing interesting perspectives to the debates on land management in this Sixth Schedule region. The study indicates, firstly: that land alienation, displacement and socio-economic marginalisation affects vulnerable people in the tribal communities, despite the constitutional protection. Community land control does not in itself ensure protection for individuals against land alienation and marginalisation. Secondly: Land alienation and marginalisation can gain impetus through “external threats”, including development initiatives by the state. However, displacements are also driven by intra-community land alienations. Thirdly: The Sixth Schedule aimed to protect and preserve the tribal communities’ way of life and was primarily a ‘settlement’ between the Indian state and particular social groups. Individual social justice would presumably flow from protection and preservation of the communities’ own social justice mechanisms. Communal land holdings are one such tribal social security convention that has been assumed to serve the cause of social justice. However, with time, and the influences of modern communications and the market economy, the communities are becoming more heterogeneous, which also challenges the ‘tribal ethics’ of land relations. ;K.N.

eldis:A31622;Livelihood diversification in Borana pastoral communities of Ethiopia - prospects and challenges;;This paper analyses the livelihoods of the Borana pastoral communities of Southern Oromiya in Ethiopia. It aims to inform policy makers, donors, and development practitioners about the best strategies for protecting and promoting sustainable livelihoods in the region. The study is based on survey data from participatory research carried out in three communities, as well as stakeholder consultations at district and regional levels. The study draws the following conclusions: • livestock mobility can potentially allow higher productivity, due to changing environment, water and feed sources and better pasture supply • mobility is limited by a number of factors, including population growth, settlement, land claims by different ethnic groups on rangelands and drought • richer households oppose expansion of croplands, as they have more livestock, while the poor have fewer livestock and want more cropland to diversify income • agro-pastoralists are significantly poorer than the pure pastoral communities, indicating that farming has been adapted to cope with food insecurity caused by declining livestock herd• pastoralists have also diversified into petty trades, wage, remittance, firewood and charcoal production, and incense collection. The paper makes a number of recommendations, which include: • policy makers should seek to avoid conflict between crop producers and large livestock owners through appropriate land use policy designed with participation of all stakeholders• government should recognise that mobility of livestock is an important livelihood option in the pastoral areas• investment in rural infrastructure such as roads, radio and other means of communication in the pastoral areas would help increase market access and allow information sharing for early warning• asset ownership by women would help poor households create an asset base. ;"K.

eldis:A69787;Reducing the vulnerability of urban slum dwellers in the Southern African region to the impact of climate change and disasters;;"Current estimates of climate change state that the world’s average temperature is due to increase by at least 2oC to 2.4oC over the next 50?100 years. Furthermore it is expected that by the end of the century a range of additional impacts will be felt: sea levels will rise by an estimated 60cm, resulting in flooding and the salinisation of fresh water aquifers, and snow and ice cover will decrease. Simultaneously, precipitation patterns will change so that some areas will receive large increases whilst other areas will become hotter and drier.

This concept paper summarises some of the current issues, concerns and debates surrounding urban vulnerability, climate change and the ability of certain adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce or moderate the impacts and effects of climate change for slum and informal dwellers.

Importantly for urban areas, it is expected that there will be an increase in the number and severity of certain types of “disasters” such as tropical cyclones, storms, floods and heat waves (GTZ, n.d.). There will also be a host of indirect impacts for cities, such as decreases in food production, freshwater availability and large numbers of migrants and climate change refugees (World Bank, 2010).

The paper find that the end result is that poor urban dwellers who already live in states of vulnerability and currently bear the highest health and diseases burden will be most affected by climate change. Within that group, differentiations can still be made such that women, the very young, and very old, new migrants and the generally socially and politically marginalized will be most adversely affected.

The author conludes by admiting that there are certainly ‘gaps’ in the literature, advocacy  on vulnerability of urban dwellers to climate change and suggests a variety of interventions around land rights, land tenure and vulnerability, mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce or moderate the impacts and effects of climate change for slum and informal dwellers.

eldis:A14026;Risk-sharing networks among households in rural Ethiopia;;This paper tests the role of informal risk-sharing networks by setting up a limited commitment model and using panel data on informal credit transactions from Ethiopia.Findings:enforcement problems limit the direct role of credit transactions in risk sharing arrangements between rural households, whether the villages are ethnically homogenous or nothouseholds with more land have better access to the informal credit markets and access is significantly improved through their participation in small group networksinformal credit market and the networks under consideration serve little purpose to the land poor householdsThe paper concludes that full risk-sharing does not appear to materialise at the village level. It recommends that policy action is needed to improve access to credit and insurance options for the poor on the basis of equity and efficiency grounds. Further research is also needed to have a better understanding of rural households in Ethiopia and the role of small networks in consumption smoothing. ;D.

eldis:A20035;Gas flaring in Nigeria: a human rights, environmental and economic monstrosity;;This report examines the social, environmental and economic consequences of gas flaring- the process of burning-off surplus combustible vapours from a well, either as a means of disposal or as a safety measure -  in the Niger Delta. More gas is flared in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world. Estimates are notoriously unreliable, but roughly 2.5 billion cubic feet of gas associated with crude oil is wasted in this way everyday.Flaring of associated gas began at the start of the industry in the Delta at the very end of British rule, and has been carried to world record heights by Shell, ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, Agip and TotalFinaElf in joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. This has happened despite its immense social, environmental and economic costs, which have made it general illegal since 1984:the flares have contributed more greenhouse gases than all of sub- Saharan Africa combinedthe flares contain a cocktail of toxins that affect the health and livelihood of local communities, exposing Niger Delta residents to an increased risk of premature deaths, child respiratory illnesses, asthma and cancer2.5 billion cubic feet of gas associated with crude oil is wasted in this way everyday which is equal to 40% of all Africa's natural gas consumption in 2001, while the annual financial loss to Nigeria is about US $2.5 billionthe benefits of nearly half a century of oil production have gone almost exclusively to the multinationals and the corrupt local eliteeven though the Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and the major transnational oil companies appear to have agreed a non-binding commitment to a flare-out date of 2008, efforts to achieve the target have been, at best, slowwith crude oil production having risen to 2.5 million barrels per day in 2004, and with the projected increase to 4 million barrels per day by 2010, it is difficult to see how most of the resulting increased amounts of associated gas will not be flare.The report demands an immediate end to gas flaring, and an end to exploration and new oil field development until facilities are in place for the utilisation of all associated gas.[adapted from author] ;;;Friends of the Earth International ;eldis;01/01/2005;en;"environment;climate change;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"202;NGA";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A20035;http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC19308.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldis.org%2Fvfile%2Fupload%2F1%2Fdocument%2F0708%2FDOC19308.pdf;;;;"gas flaring;gas;Corporate Social Responsibility;ChevronTexaco;TotalFinaElf;SHELL;Climate change;Extractive industries oil;Extractive industries;ExxonMobil;Agip"
eldis:A12940;Soil conservation in Tigray, Ethiopia;;This report presents a review into soil erosion and conservation research and efforts made in Tigray.The report includes both traditional measures and activities promoted by non-government organisations (NGO's) and government projects. Main emphasis is placed on stone terracing and stone bunds since these are the most widely used soil conservation measures in the region. Relatively limited research has been made in Tigray, therefore the report includes some findings from other parts of the Ethiopian highlands for comparison.Findings include: the building of stone terraces in Hagere Selam, Tigray, led to increased yields of wheat on four-year old terraces. Farmers also seem to be aware of the long-term effects of soil conservation measures on crop yields, but may not be in a position to act on their own to protect their soil.Recommendations include:a new approach to the farmer in many cases. Since reducing soil erosion is likely to be a less important objective for the farmer than securing immediate food needs, recommended changes should be shown to provide tangible resultsconstruction of mechanical conservation structures should be followed up by other inputs, such as fertiliser, improved seeds, and other farming factors. If no additional improvement is offered, the promised yield increase from conservation measures is likely to be small ;K.Vågen Esser;;Noragric, Department of International Environment and Development Studies, Norwegian University of Life Sciences;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"agriculture;farmers";;;"ETH;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12940;http://www.nlh.no/noragric/publications/reports/rep5_bodytext.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nlh.no%2Fnoragric%2Fpublications%2Freports%2Frep5_bodytext.pdf;;;;"Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Farmers;SOIL;Crop production seeds and fertilizers;Ethiopia;Soil and land management;agriculture;Norway;Agriculture Norway;conservation;erosion;EADI;terraces;Agriculture and food;Soils Norway;Drylands Norway;Agriculture inputs;crops;Africa;Tigray;yield;terracing"
eldis:A20137;Land rights for African development: from knowledge to action;;"This collection of briefing papers summarises select papers presented at the workshop: ""Land Rights for African Development: From Knowledge to Action"" held in November 2005. The workshop addressed key land tenure issues in Africa that influence food security, environmental sustainability, agricultural intensification, conflict, peace building and broader rural development.Issues covered by the 12 briefing papers contained in this collection include: the prevalence and importance of customary tenurethe prevalence and importance of common property arrangementsconstraints to women’s access under both customary and statutory tenurethe need to secure common property and other forms of tenurethe importance of broad based participation to secure broad consensus among multiple actors in order to enhance the efficiency, equity and sustainability objectives of land tenure reforms.The briefing papers also reflect on the innovations necessary for securing tenure for the poor under a variety of settings. These innovations include:adjusting received law to customary norms and rules of land holding and access, as opposed to outright replacing customary tenurealtering lending rules by banks and financial institutions to promote land-related investments (even on land regulated by customary and/or religious law)de-emphasising the notion of ownership and refocusing on use rights in order to secure women’s rights and accessrestructuring conventional land administration systems to support group-based rights structuresencouraging decentralised land management systems that reflect local cultural norms and practicesin situations of multiple, overlapping resource use, strengthening processes of negotiation and conflict resolution as opposed to a generic concern with substantive rights in order to secure the access of permanent and transitory resource users.A ten-step procedure is also suggested (Alden Wily), which would enable communities to restore their group rights and practices to create and control their own tenure norms. These innovations, while desirable, are also risky: corruption, elite capture, exclusion of ""non-members"" and lack of capacities have been hurdles faced by communities.Agreed outcomes from the workshop include the following:land tenure in Africa is complex: the existence of customary, religious and statutory arrangements (i.e. legal pluralism) is a critical, defining feature of African land tenure. Land tenure reform must accommodate this complexity rather than replace itthe pit-falls of formalisation should be avoided, and in particular tenure codification should be delinked from collateralisation: cheaper ways of registering rights than the cadastre are neededin order to effectively address land tenure security, power issues at local and national levels must be addressed: there is a need for a multi-level, multiple actor approach. Land tenure reform is an urgent governance issue that can best be addressed by all development partners in collaborationon evaluation: the implementation and impacts of land tenure reforms should be evaluated at multiple governance levels in order to identify constraints, craft solutions, and to ensure that reforms are securing the rights and livelihoods of women, the poor and marginalised groupson innovation: new innovations are needed over and above tinkering with existing possibilities. For instance, the development of centres for legal advice and assistance for both rural and urban dwellers may enable the poor to claim their rights and even challenge abuses of power. ";"E. Mwangi

eldis:A24695;Chop fine: the human rights impact of local government corruption and mismanagement in Rivers State, Nigeria;;This Human Rights Watch report examines the misuse of public funds by local officials in the Rivers State of Nigeria’s. It is based on interviews in Rivers state with government and donor agency officials, civil servants, health care workers, teachers, civil society groups and local residents. Also state and local government budgets are analysed.Despite Nigeria’s strong oil industry ordinary Nigerians have derived appallingly little benefit from that wealth and the misuse of public funds by local officials had harmful effects on primary education and basic health care. Findings of the report include: Local governments have failed to make more than nominal investments into health care and educationAt the same time, the governor of Rivers budgeted tens of millions of dollars that year alone on questionable priorities like foreign travel, “gifts” and “souvenirs” to unspecified recipients, and the purchase of jet aircraft and fleets of new cars for his office Part of the reason these problems have not been addressed is that nearly eight years after the end of military rule, the people of Rivers State still have no way of holding their local officials accountable for their actions.Human Rights Watch urges all levels of government in Nigeria to enact without delay key reforms to make state and local governments more transparent and accountable to the public. Their detailed report gives clear recommendations for a number of different stakeholders. Recommendations include: The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria should enact and sign into law the Freedom of Information, Fiscal Responsibility and Public Audit and Accountability bills without delay The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission should be more proactive in launching and following through on criminal investigations into credible allegations of corruption The Government of Rivers State should increase budgetary expenditures for health and education so as to progressively realise these basic rights   Foreign governments and donor agencies should prioritise programmes to improve good governance and transparency of state and local governments in Nigeria Foreign companies operating in the Niger Delta should publish and ensure wide public dissemination of regular and detailed accountings of all development, social and humanitarian expenditures undertaken by the company in the Niger Delta in order to differentiate private from public funding, and make government expenditures more transparent. ;Ch.

eldis:A21406;Agriculture and poverty in South Africa: can agriculture reduce poverty?;;Poverty and income inequality persist in South Africa despite efforts to eliminate them. Poverty is more pervasive in rural areas, particularly in the former homelands: the majority (65 percent) of the poor are found in rural areas and 78 percent of those likely to be chronically poor are also in rural areas. This paper investigates the role that smallholder agriculture plays in alleviating poverty and discusses how this role can be enhanced.The paper begins by presenting some theoretical aspects of agriculture’s contribution to poverty alleviation drawing on literature on agricultural and rural development. Next, the role played by smallholder agriculture in improving livelihoods in South Africa is investigated. The author discusses government initiatives aimed at promoting smallholder agricultural development. These include land reform, agricultural credit, infrastructure and comprehensive farmer support services. Finally, the issue of what needs to be done to maximise agriculture’s contribution to poverty alleviation is addressed. Suggestions include:investing in the ‘prime movers’ of agricultural development through human capital, agricultural research, biophysical capital formation, and rural institutionsdrawing on lessons from global experience, particularly from Asia’s green revolution – the main elements of which included physical infrastructure, technological innovation and diffusion, fertiliser and chemical applicationproduction of high value added products such as animal products, horticulture and beverage cropsstrengthening farm/non-farm linkagesThe paper concludes that promoting smallholder agricultural growth can be an effective strategy to reduce rural poverty and income inequality. However, while agriculture plays a major role in poverty alleviation, the poverty problem in South Africa cannot be solved by promoting smallholder agricultural growth alone. More attention should also be given to the promotion of nonfarm activities. A strategy that pays attention to the strengthening of farm/nonfarm linkages is likely to yield better results in terms of employment and income generation. ;C.L.

eldis:A18046;Models for recognising indigenous land rights in Latin America;;"This paper discusses issues surrounding indigenous land rights, sharing an understanding and information about land tenure and titling within Latin America.  The study focuses on examples from the country level, with the aim of influencing policy coherence and legislation.In particular, Chapter four of this document examines the implications of indigenous land tenure for natural resource management, using case studies from Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama and Peru.  It explores how the differing bodies of law in each country contribute to or undermine the ability of indigenous people to manage their natural resources.The paper draws out the following conclusions:land is not only a physical asset with some economic and financial value, but an intrinsic dimension and part of peoples lives and belief systemsthe legal situation of indigenous land rights in the countries of Latin America is highly variedthere is no single pattern of legal rights that guarantees a successful outcome on the ground for indigenous land tenure; rather, different combinations of rights can yield strong or weak results, depending on the context and the extent of political willlegal systems strongly support indigenous land rights when they take into account not only land ownership itself, but also the security of that ownership and whether it is conceptualized within the framework of the concept of an indigenous territoryland rights are stronger when the legal system concurrently recognises other rights over natural resources on indigenous lands and the rights of indigenous peoples to manage their own affairsrecognising the land rights of indigenous peoples is not a simple question of granting title, but involves addressing a more complex set of interrelated legal, social, and political issues in order to be effective and secure.[adapted from author] ";R.

As the report highlights, companies should:publish what they pay to governments wherever they operate on a country-by-country basiscall on G8 governments to announce a commitment to developing global standards at the G8 summit this year adopt a more systematic approach to publishing payments made to governments in every country in which they operate by, for example, publishing a clear company policy on transparency or developing  a simple reporting templatework collaboratively with other companies, civil society and host governments to build disclosure agreements into their contracts actively engage with the EITI to support progress where host governments are willing improve anti-corruption and whistle-blowing systems where performance is pooruse the standards provided in this report to measure and publicise progress on transparency issues against competitors on an annual basis. ;;;Save the Children Fund ;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A18812;http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC18137.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldis.org%2Fvfile%2Fupload%2F1%2Fdocument%2F0708%2FDOC18137.pdf;;;;"Private sector corruption;Corporate Social Responsibility;Good governance corruption;Extractive industries oil;Governance;Business and corruption;Extractive industries;Good Governance"
eldis:A14643;People in motion: an entitlements approach to Karimojong agro-pastoralism;;This paper describes and analyses people’s security of access to means of production among the Karimojong herd-owners who inhabit the North-Eastern districts of Uganda. It claims that Ugandan statutory land management policy and law undermines the customary tenure system, thereby threatening access security for Karimojong agro-pastoralists. The paper intends to gain insight in the customary tenure system of Karamoja in order to contribute to the appreciation and formal recognition of this system by government authorities.The paper finds that the customary tenure system has four main principles, and proposes recommendations for each one of them:Pastoral mobility: optimal mobility is required to provide access to scarce and unevenly spread natural resources:disarmament: the state military should continue to collect weapons, track down raiders and bring them to justice in order to restore peace and security in Karamojaprotected areas: restricting animal grazing inside protected areas should be avoided because grazing movements in these areas are of tremendous importance in the pastoral cyclemining: local populations should be consulted every time environmental prospecting licenses are allocated, so they can prevent potentially disruptive activitiesthe Land Act: alternative arrangements for land property should be set, as the Land Act cannot represent the nature of customary ownership of pastoral grazing landsSeparating and spreading villages: villages have to separate and spread over the tribal territory in order to allow its members to obtain enough good quality lands around the village:relocation of villages could bring a solution to many of the problems the congested towns of the district faceDiversifying lands: the family land domain in the area ideally consists of several small—one to three acres—plots of land:the Land Act should avoid fixing land ownership in the hands of one owner only, which would regress the rights actual users built up over timeNon-alienation of land: the principle of non-alienation is apparent in all forms of natural resource use in the district, although this principle is not very obvious because tribal and sectional geographic boundaries are so vague:to protect community interests the best way forward is to legalise properties through certification of agricultural lands, woodlands, pastures and water resourcesconsideration should be paid to the fact that insecurity of access does not hit equally hard on every Karimojong individual, family or village: poor families often lack the social and material assets to benefit from their access rights in terms of actual crop production and animal grazing[adapted from author] ;R. de Koning;;Centre for International Development Issues, University of Nijmegen;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"protected areas;land tenure;poverty;rural development;land ownership";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"UGA;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14643;http://www.ru.nl/contents/pages/30264/op113.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ru.nl%2Fcontents%2Fpages%2F30264%2Fop113.pdf;;;;"agro-pastoralists;Pastoralism;protected areas;Rural development;EADI;land tenure;Agriculture and food;Poverty;Uganda;entitlements;Customary tenure system;Pastoralism mobility;pastoralism;land ownership;Pastoralism resource management"
eldis:A101903;Land distribution in Northern Ethiopia from 1998 to 2016: Gender-disaggregated, spatial and intertemporal variation;;This study utilizes land registry data from the First and Second Stage Land Registration Reforms that took place in 1998 and 2016 in sampled districts and communities in Tigray region of Ethiopia. Tigray was the first region to implement low-cost land registration and certification in Ethiopia and providing household level land certificates in the names of household heads. Second Stage Land Registration and Certification (SSLRC) is scaled up since 2015 and provides households with parcel-based certificates with maps. The SSLR&C lists all holders of parcels by name and gender. We utilize the SSLR data for detailed gender disaggregated analysis after aggregating parcel data by gender to household level and categorizing households in male- and female-headed households. Data from 11 municipalities (tabias) in four districts (woredas) are utilized. This covers 78700 parcels in the SSLR database allocated to 31500 households. Various statistical measures, including graphical tools, are used to assess the gender-disaggregated, spatial and intertemporal variation in land distribution. The comparison of First Stage Land Registry (FSLR) data with SSLR data facilitates critical assessment of the quality of the FSLR data as well as an assessment of changes in farm size distribution over the 18 years period. We find from the total sample of SSLR data, which represents an area of 30000 ha, that the female ownership share for this land is as high as 48.8% and indicates a considerably lower skewness in the distribution between men and women than we had hypothesized. The Gini-coefficient for land distribution among women is lower than that among men (0.45 versus 0.57). The share of male-headed households with no female landowners varied from 25 to 60% across communities. Male-headed households have on average 34% more land than female-headed households but this difference was reduced to less than 10% in terms of land per capita (after correcting for differences in family size between male-headed and female-headed households). There is a clear trend towards smaller farm sizes from the FSLR in 1998 to the SSLR in 2016. The share of farms below one ha varies from 0.50 to 0.90 across communities in the SSLR data. ;"S.T.

eldis:A21740;Land registration and women’s land rights in Amhara Region, Ethiopia;;Assesses the ongoing land registration process in the Amhara Region and its outcomes for women. The paper finds that while land policy and registration procedures aim to guarantee women’s access to land, practice on the ground suggests more needs to be done to support women’s rights in the implementation process.Land registration, initiated in 2003, stipulates that both spouses should be named on the certificate. However, research findings in one-third of all kebeles in Amhara, found that only 39 per cent of the plots was registered under joint title, while 29 per cent was under female holding (including many female headed households), and 33 percent registered with men. Married women therefore continue to be denied joint titling. Most local land administration committees were only composed of men and local leaders and government officials had not promoted women’s participation. However, where women were part of committees, they were active in protecting women’s rights, particularly of women who were vulnerable and lacked family support or social networks.This report forms part of a series of seven papers based on a research programme entitled “Securing Land Rights in Africa: Can land registration serve the poor?” led by IIED. ;A.

eldis:A14514;Hands off: why international financial institutions must stop drilling, piping and mining;;This report reviews the experience and outcomes of the funding by International Financial Institutions (IFIs) of projects in the extractive industries. It presents short case studies of experiences in the Philippines, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Romania, Colombia, Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, which then uses to make recommendations. The report argues that:IFIs have pressured governments in poor countries to rigorously open up to foreign investment in the extractive industries, and have channelled billions of dollars directly to large transnational corporations (TNCs) to finance the construction of drilling platforms, pipelines and large-scale mineswhile the external debt continues to grow and on the ground development benefits have yet to materialise, the coal, oil, gas and minerals are exported out of the countriesthis export-led development paradigm has been devastating for local communities: poverty is soaring, and ecosystems are ravagedcorporations, which rake in large profits, benefit the most from this lopsided arrangementRecommendations include:IFIs should establish a plan to phase out investments in the extractive sectors, including structural adjustment lendingas a first and immediate step, IFIs should establish no-go areas such as protected areas, indigenous peoples’ zones and areas of armed conflict, where they will not promote oil, mining and gas projectsIFIs should focus their remaining investments in extractive industries on the closing down of mines, on helping displaced industry workers to find new jobs, on restoring degraded ecosystems and communities, and on the shift towards renewable energy projectsall actors involved should cooperate in repairing the damage done by past projectsgovernments should shift their financial support to decentralised and participatory initiatives that truly benefit people and the environment (i.e. a transition to renewable, efficient and decentralised energy production for sustainable societies)[adapted from author] ;"J.

eldis:A18089;Oil and water in Sudan;;Sudan, a nation of 36 million people wracked by conflict for 34 of the last 45 years, has generated some four million displaced people during the course of its war. It is estimated that over two million Sudanese people have died as a result of fighting and related starvation and disease.  Most conventional analyses have focussed on the identity-based dichotomies to explain the conflict.  This paper identifies how environmental and ecological variables contribute to the war and how it is waged in Sudan.The paper’s analysis is guided by a hypothesis linking five ecological variables to the conflict cycle. The authors expect that competition for scarce resources will emerge as a causal factor. They also anticipate that an important determinant will be the struggle to exploit and control the ecological sources of surplus value - oil in particular.The analysis of the Sudanese conflict cycle begins with an overview of the Sudan conflict, tracing the system’s history, underlying pattern and distinctive features. This in turn reveals systemic elements and cyclical dynamics of the Sudan conflict system, which can then be used to guide policy interventions.Turning to the environmental analysis, the paper explores the interaction between people and their environment in Sudan, illustrating how natural systems shape the north-south divide. It then examines the patterns of resource consumption and management, revealing how a topdown approach to resource management has deepened the fissures in the Sudanese society.The paper finds that:there are clear environmental and ecological determinants of the conflictthe Nile River system created a natural division leading to the polarisation of African-Arab identitiesthe government has manipulated this advantage to its benefit, and the violence arising out of the disunity of the southern movement has played into its handsthe population in the contested border zones - the Abyei Dinka, the Nuba, and perhaps Shilluk to the west - that has suffered most directly from the warthe beneficiaries of the war are the elites on both sides who camouflage their struggle to control critical natural resources through ideologies of identity and resistancethe most valuable of these commodities by far is the Bentiu oil.The paper identifies specific areas for policy and legal reform, and these are:decentralisation of significant economic and political powers to lower levels of governmentcommunity empowerment over land and natural resourceseconomic diversification in south Sudan to decrease dependence on subsistence productionequity as a guiding principle in allocating rights to land and resources, and the distribution of economic benefitsdevelopment of a comprehensive land and natural resource development and use plan through participatory, inclusive and public process. ;"P.

eldis:A21743;Land Registration in Eastern and Western Regions, Ghana;;Assesses the process of rural land registration in Ghana and its outcomes for poor and marginalised groups.In Ghana, deeds registration has been in place since colonial times, and enables right holders to record their land transactions. However, very little rural land has actually been affected by this registration process. The research shows a general lack of awareness of the registration process among the majority of cash and food crop farmers. High monetary and transaction costs and a long and cumbersome process also constrain use of deeds registration. As a result, while farmers in both Western and Eastern Regions increasingly make use of written documents to secure their transactions, very few bother to register those documents with the deeds registry.On the other hand, deeds registration is commonly used by agribusiness, and by mining and timber companies acquiring interests in land. In other words, while the deeds registration system seems to cater for the needs of medium to large-scale enterprises, it does not respond to the needs of small holders. The ongoing land administration reform programme needs to address these issues in order to establish institutions and processes that secure the land rights of poorer and more vulnerable groups.This report forms part of a series of seven papers based on a research programme entitled “Securing Land Rights in Africa: Can land registration serve the poor?” led by IIED. ;"O.

It argues that perfect targeting of such programs may not be attainable not only due to flaws in operational and institutional designs but also due to imperfections in factor marketsexamines farm households' decision to use purchased land quality enhancing inputs (e.g. fertilizer) and how this is affected by households' elicited risk preferences while controlling for institutional, plot, household and village level factorsanalyzes the role of tenure insecurity, resource poverty, risk and time preferences, and public conservation programs on private investment by focusing on medium and long-term land conservation measuresMain findings include:the credit program’s focus on providing production credit does not target the relatively worse-off householdsprogram participation has a positive and  significant effect on the change in the level of income derived from self-employment (but insignificant effect on wage employment) underlining the importance of capital constraints to access to self-employmenthousehold labour endowment is an important factor in a household’s decision to participate in FFW.  Poor, but labour rich, households are selected into the programs, which show efficient program targeting. However, once households have decided to participate in FFW programs, the intensity of participation is not strongly determined by the labour endowment of households. Asset holding of rural households seems to have influenced the amount of labour supplied, which may involve a serious leakage in targetingrisk preferences do not seem to adversely affect households’ decision to use fertilizercollective investment organized by public led conservation programs is found to significantly stimulate private investment in land conservation. Plot level variables and households’ perceptions (including risk preferences) are important on returns from conservation investments, in terms of improved land quality and increased crop yield, in the decision to invest and intensify soil conservation ;F.

eldis:A15983;Socio-economic dominance of ethnic and racial groups: the African experience;;This paper argues that socio-economic dominance based on ethnic and race factors is a long standing phenomena in Africa, which was instigated by colonial rule and perpetuated by elite interests in capital accumulation and political power during the post-colonial era. The report looks at experiences from a range of countries, including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Rwanda and the Congo.It finds that ethnic dominance-building strategies have tended to focus on the control of access to limited resources. This is due to the generally weak economic performance of African countries, dependence on the state for basic social and economic resource accumulation and social services, the over-reliance on agricultural resources (land, water, etc) for livelihoods, and negative external transfers.  Because the African economy continues to depend on primary production (especially agriculture and mining) dominated by traditional exports with limited overall employment capacities in the secondary economic sectors, competition tends to be focused on the scarce education and employment opportunities, and for natural resources, primarily land.The paper aims to:develop a conceptual framework examining ethnic and racial socio-economic dominance in Africaidentify the historical and specifically colonial roots of ethnicity and socio-economic disparitiesassess contemporary empirical patterns of socio-economic disparities along ethnic and racial lines, based upon key selected variablesanalyse the strategies used to mobilize ethnicity and race towards the accumulation of power and economic resourcesexamine public policies and civic strategies aimed at redressing ethnic and racial resource imbalancesPolitical power through the state has been a key instrument of exclusion, and its maintenance has been sought through extreme measures, including war. External interests have fomented these dominance building process.

eldis:A73544;Corporate social responsibility in South Africa’s mining industry: an assessment;;"The corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda has been a part of the global debate on socio-economic development for many decades. Countless claims have been made that CSR can contribute towards more inclusive development and the alleviation of poverty. This briefing examines the concept and role of CSR in the mining industry of South Africa. The mining case study reviewed here demonstrates that key implementation challenges are a lack of co-ordination and alignment with the government’s development plans, at both national and local level, coupled with weak monitoring and evaluation. Too frequently CSR programmes are centred on business-orientated objectives that are not fully integrated with broader, country-level development plans. This briefing highlights how the current CSR agenda and its practice may be unsuited to effectively addressing social problems and delivering socio-economic development plans in South Africa.
Recommendations:

    mining companies should think more critically about the relevance of CSR practice to their business. Enhancing ‘socially responsible investment’ should be central to their corporate strategy
    mining companies should work closely with nongovernmental organisations and civil society in order to ascertain context specific diagnoses of the social and development challenges facing near-mine communities
    there should be stronger engagement with and alignment between CSR practice and development policy frameworks such as the NDP 2030, LED plans and IDPs
    there should be consistent review, monitoring and evaluation of CSR programmes to ensure that they remain relevant and meet the objectives of delivering socio-economic development plans. This will place emphasis on the importance of ‘corporate accountability’ and ‘sustainable development’

eldis:A30074;Treasure or Trouble? Mining in developing countries;;This policy paper for the world bank addresses the question of whether countries consider their mineral wealth an asset, to be used to stimulate or enhance their economic growth potential, or are there reasons to steer an economy away from the development of the mineral sector?Reviewing the cases of 51 “mining countries” in the developing world, three conclusions can be drawn:First, in more cases than not, mining countries appear to fare better than other countries in their respective regions. Second, where they do fare well, their good performance appears to be associated mostly with institutional stability and overall good economic management, particularly that relating to the management of revenues from the mining sector and the management of the sector itself.Third, the need to build institutional stability and improve economic management is most urgent in countries where the mining sector dominates an economy and where poor economic management and weak institutions are persistent features.In contrast to some analyses, this paper finds no reason to assume a causal relationship between a dominant mining sector and overwhelming economic ills. Nonetheless, it acknowledges the need to take special steps to prevent vested interests from expropriating mining and mineral resources that could otherwise be used to create economic assets for future generations. To these ends, the paper emphasises the need for policymakers to design and strengthen general economic policies and institutions for financial management, as well as specific frameworks and institutions for the mining sector.The challenge the author identifies is to turn the national endowment of mineral resources into national wealth. In this regard, there are lessons to be learned for other mining countries from both the “worst of class”and “best of class” performers profiled in this study. [authors summary] ;M.

eldis:A73051;Seizing the global opportunity: Partnerships for better growth and a better climate – the 2015 new climate economy report;;"With 2015 representing a year of unprecedented opportunity with regard to the landmark intergovernmental conferences on development and climate action, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate have produced this substantial report which makes the case for all parties to forge new and improved strategic partnerships for economic growth and a better climate.The first part of the report focuses on new opportunities and challenges for low-carbon growth and international cooperation, examining recent trends and developments, and international cooperation both within and without the UNFCCC process. Part two then identifies key areas for international and multi-stakeholder action.The commission recommends that in the key economic systems where growth and emissions are concentrated:

     Low-carbon development in the world’s cities should be accelerated, with commitments in place by 2020 that prioritise low-emission public transport, building efficiency, renewable energy, and efficient waste management.
     Governments, finance institutions, and the private sector must ensure that agricultural and forest landscapes are restored and protected, and agricultural productivity is increased.
     A total of at least $1 trillion a year must be invested in clean energy, aided through multilateral and national development banks scaling up their collaboration with government and the private sector.
     Efficiency standards must be raised to the global best, necessitating increased cooperation between G20 nations.

Additionally, recommendations concerning key drivers of both economic growth and emissions reductions, fields of business and finance activity, and sectors where international action can unlock low-cost emissions reductions include:

     Implementing effective carbon pricing and the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.
     Ensuring that new infrastructure is climate-smart, integrating climate risks and objectives in policies and planning.
     Low-carbon innovation should be galvanised through strategic partnerships hat include developed and developing countries, and the private sector.
     Businesses should adopt short- and long-term emission reduction targets, with all major industry sectors agreeing market-wide transformation road-maps.
     Ambitions must be raised in reducing international aviation and maritime emissions.
     The use of all hydrofluorocarbons should be phased out as soon as possible.

The aim is to highlight the importance of nuanced policy advice, but also to illustrate some general principles for formulating such policy advice in specific country settings.Conclusions and recommendations include:providing secure tenure to land is needed to improve the welfare of the poor, in particular, by enhancing the asset base of those, such as women, whose land rights are often neglected. It also creates the incentives needed for investment, a key element underlying sustainable economic growth. The report discusses different mechanisms that can be used to promote tenure security, their advantages and disadvantages, and the ways in which they can fit into a broader development strategyfacilitating the exchange and distribution of land at low cost is central to expediting land access by productive but land-poor producers and, once the economic environment is right, the development of financial markets that rely on the use of land as collateral. Removing impediments to rental market transactions can help generate considerable equity advantages and at the same time establish the basis for a positive investment climate and the diversification of economic activity, especially in the rural non-farm sector. Non-market mechanisms for transferring land (e.g. inheritance, award of public and state lands) have historically played a major role in either facilitating or obstructing broad land access and effective land use. Policymakers should take careful account of these processesgovernments have a clear role to play in promoting and contributing to socially desirable land allocation and utilisation. Appropriate incentives for sustainable land use are also required. Mechanisms, ranging from taxation to regulation and land use planning, are needed to address these issues. Effective dissemination of knowledge and experience requires that research be informed by the broad range of problems policymakers face and be integrated into a broader dialogue with the Bank’s development partners ;K.

eldis:A61760;Water grabbing? Focus on the (re)appropriation of finite water resources;;Recent large-scale land acquisitions for agricultural production, also known as land grabbing, have attracted headline attention. However, water as both a target and driver of this phenomenon has been largely ignored in the debate. This special issue of Water Alternatives aims to fill this gap and to widen the perspective beyond the limited focus on agriculture-driven resource grabbing. The articles in this collection demonstrate that the fluid nature of water and its hydrologic complexity often obscure how water grabbing takes place and what the associated impacts on the environment and diverse social groups are. The discussed factors combined with the powerful material, discursive and symbolic characteristics of water make water grabbing a site for conflict with potential drastic impacts on the current and future uses and benefits of water. ;L.

eldis:A73502;Towards efficient land use in Brazil;;"This report focuses on the promotion of economic growth and improving ecosystem protection within Brazil’s rural landscape.

It argues that there is significant potential for simultaneously promoting both these things, but also that substantial improvements are already underway. It highlights that increasing global demand for food and the need to address climate change risk make it ever more urgent to both protect ecosystems and use land more productively and efficiently. The report argues that well-functioning markets and policies can boost the pace at which these changes are happening and help the country to realise latent land use efficiency gains.

The report is split into three parts focused on the misallocation in Brazilian land use, learning from the past and looking ahead.

The report seeks to assess the current and future situation in the districts of Mandailing Natal, Tapanuli Selatan and Tapanuli Utara, taking into account both economic and conservation perspectives.

The SNV Siting Tool was used to identify areas suitable for sustainable crop production. In addition to biophysical and biodiversity considerations, the potential impact of climate change on land suitability was included, enabling the development of a long term vision for sustainable growth for the target sectors.

eldis:A75379;The expropriation and compensation system in Korea ;;"For the last 60 years, the Korean economy has achieved an astounding development that is called “the Miracle of the Han River.” Korea was one of the world’s poorest countries at the time of the national liberation in 1945 and it went through a three-year long Korean War from 1950. However, it grew into one of the world’s leading trading powers. Its per capita income, which was merely 255 USD in 1970, reached 22,000 USD as of 2012. One of the most important factors that enabled the Korean economy to achieve such a great development was the consistent expansion of its social overhead capital and its wellplanned national development projects.

There was no expropriation and compensation system before the 1960s. Although the principle of expropriation and compensation and security of property rights were specified in the Constitution in 1948, the land expropriation during the time was in accord with the
Land Expropriation Decree established during the Japanese colonial period.

Art. 23-3 of the Korean Constitution stipulates that “Expropriation, use, or limitation of private property due to public necessity and with regard to compensation shall be governed by an Act so that just compensation shall be paid.” Hence, expropriation, which means compulsory deprivation of private property rights by the governmental authority for public needs, is based on the assumption that there is a necessity for the public good when private property is to be compulsorily acquired regardless of a person’s will as stipulated in Art. 23-3 of the Constitution. As for just compensation designated by the Constitution for individual
infringements of private property rights that require compensation in the enforcement of law and order, the compensation, in principle, means full compensation that the objective value of expropriated properties should be completely indemnified.

eldis:A27805;What's Special About Wildlife Management In Forests?:  Concepts And Models Of Rights-Based Management, With Recent Evidence From West-Central Africa;;"Wildlife consumption is an integral part of the livelihood and trade patterns of many peoples in the developing world, and highly valued by them. Yet to date the dominant models of wildlife management in areas of high – and allegedly unsustainable – consumptive use have favoured the exclusion of the users from the resource and the denial of its local values. This gives little incentive to rural dwellers to manage wildlife sustainably. Innovative strategies are required to enhance the rights of the resource users and to increase their entitlements to appropriate the benefits of wildlife for themselves. There has been little success in devising these outside areas with high tourist potential, but experience in other natural resource sectors may provide useful pointers.Policy conclusions: Strategies of wildlife management differ according to the nature of the threat to the resource, the two main threats being habitat conversion and unsustainable off-take. Where the threat is from unsustainable off-take, there are strong arguments not to apply blanket preservationist controls.  The solutions to the problem of unsustainable offtake have more to do with management than public education or awareness-raising.  Devising policies for the sustainable management of wildlife is a complex and challenging task with many unknowns; where the considerable additional transaction costs of managing wildlife cannot be offset against new benefits (from sport hunting and tourism, for example), alternative management strategies have to be adopted which explicitly promote equity and sustainability. Conventional solutions to the problem of excessive use, such as privatisation of tenure and the reinstatement of traditional control systems are very uncertain routes to poverty alleviation. Rights-based management systems, enabling people to negotiate access and assert their entitlement to resources, are an important tool to broker better development opportunities. Examples of such regulatory systems from other natural resource sectors, such as inshore fisheries, may provide useful models to regulate the offtake and enable the poor to define their rights to wildlife resources in communal management regimes.

eldis:A27804;Hunter-gatherers, conservation and development: from prejudice to policy reform;;Communities of present-day or former hunter-gatherers live in scattered communities across the world, although their precise numbers and status are very uncertain. Their often marginalised status and ethnolinguistic diversity has made it hard to articulate their case for land rights outside Australia and North America. Their preferred subsistence strategy, hunting, is often in direct conflict with conservation philosophies and protected areas often fall within their traditional hunting areas. This paper reviews their present situation and discusses some of the proposed strategies for incorporating them into more conventional natural resource management strategies.Policy conclusions: Hunter-gatherer or foraging peoples dominated much of the world until recently, but the last few centuries have seen them  marginalised almost everywhere. The rapid spread of both agriculture and livestock production has seen their traditional lands alienated and their main sources of subsistence decimated. However, just as there is an increasing realisation that pastoral peoples are efficient users of marginal environments and need to be protected from encroachment by outside interests, it is becoming apparent that foragers need similar assistance. Since the 1970s, these communities have begun to fight back, especially in the area of land rights. The establishment by Canada on 1st April, 1999 of Nunavut, a self-governing territory for the Inuit the size of western Europe, represents a major political and  economic breakthrough for foragers. Elsewhere, notably in Africa, India, SE Asia and Siberia, rights and access to land continue to be eroded.Development agencies have a poor record of interest in foragers, partly because their preferred way of life is so much at odds with  conventional development strategies. However, the recent prioritisation of poverty and marginalised peoples has refocused  attention towards them, without however, any corresponding policy development.In principle, foragers and conservationists ought to cooperate since both have a strong interest in habitat preservation and sustainable harvesting of wild resources. In practice the two groups have often found themselves in opposition. Effective progress will be made towards more appropriate systems of access and land rights if better ways for these two groups can work together.[author] ;R.

eldis:A61768;Respecting rights, delivering development: forest tenure reform since Rio 1992;;"This report evaluates the progress achieved in forest management by indigenous people and local communities, which was set as a key objective at the 1992 Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It presents new findings and identifies what needs to done to protect global forest areas and ensure their contributions to social, environmental and economic development.The paper argues that the amount of forests recognised as owned or controlled by indigenous peoples and local communities has increased globally from 10 per cent in 2002 to 15 per cent in 2012; in developing countries the increase has been from 21 to 31 per cent. It observes that the majority of governments continue to resist large-scale recognition of community land rights and many deny that indigenous peoples have any claim to their customary lands. Citing examples from Africa and Asia, the paper shows that no new areas of community rights have been recognised in the last several years.In the past, governments have sought to keep forest lands in state hands, but there is a growing push to sell or lease state lands in the interest of rapid economic development. As the world’s demand for timber, metals, meat, grains, oils and biofuels has soared, the pressure to sell has extended to many commonly owned resources, including pastures, wetlands and forests. Large-scale land acquisitions have escalated and common lands are most highly prised by national and international investors. The report emphasises that without reversing this increasing demand, there is a substantial risk that civil conflicts will grow, resources will be squandered, forests will be lost or degraded, and indigenous peoples and other local communities will continue to suffer in poverty. The report's recommendations for global leaders include:

    place tenure rights at the centre of the Rio+20 conference and other global development agendas
    include the issues of secure tenure and rights as an underlying conditions for green growth
    implement a new model of rights-based and community-led conservation
    provide support for African countries to advance the recognition of community tenure rights
    build innovative private-public partnerships to finance forest tenure reform.

eldis:A32422;Dhaka: improving living conditions for the urban poor;;"Dhaka is the fastest growing mega-city in the world, attracting an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 mostly poor migrants a year. This paper argues that urgent measures are required to address the vital needs of the city's rapidly growing urban poor. Based on a comprehensive analysis of poverty in Dhaka, it aims to provide the basis for an urban poverty reduction strategy for the Government of Bangladesh, local authorities, donors and NGOs. The study focuses on analysing the characteristics and dynamics of poverty, employment, land and housing, basic services, and crime and violence. Key points highlighted include: 

    poverty affects a third of Dhaka's residents, mostly living in slums
    adequate access to shelter, basic services, and a living wage are major challenges for the poor 
    crime and violence have also become a major problem in Dhaka, particularly affecting the poor 
    the institutional deficiencies in Dhaka impede effective city management and poverty concerns. 

The authors outline a series of policy priorities for addressing these problems and, in each case, suggest specific measures to be taken. Key priorities suggested are: 

    developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy for urban poverty reduction 
    implementing institutional mapping, reform and capacity building of key agencies / institutions affecting urban growth and poverty reduction 
    implementing the National Housing Policy to ensure shelter for the poor 
    improving service delivery and access to infrastructure for the urban poor 
    addressing crime and violence in slum areas.

eldis:A46620;Water rights for indigenous people in Mexico;;"Many water resources in Mexico run through indigenous areas. Mexican governments have often made management decisions on the basis of perceived economic needs, rather than concern for the people and ecosystems involved. This trend continues today, despite recent agreements with indigenous groups over water use.Up to 10 percent of Mexico’s population are indigenous
people. They are reliant on water resources running through their territories
and face major challenges as a result of government management policies. Research
published as part of a UNESCO series presents an overview of the challenges
facing indigenous peoples in Mexico as a result of government policies.
Mexican governments have traditionally sought to centralise
control of water resources and implement projects they see as beneficial to
national and corporate interests, such as irrigation and hydroelectricity
projects. The recent dams on the Usumacinta River indicate that the situation
has not improved since the election in 2000, despite
agreements against such developments (such as the San Andres agreement), backed
by a large coalition of indigenous groups.
Successive governments have progressively taken control of
water resources away from local authorities and given power to federal
officials in the National Water Commission. These officials do not listen to those
people who best understand the rivers, springs, lakes and aquifers – the
indigenous peoples and other communities who live in these territories. The
watershed councils formed a decade ago are weak and implement management rules erratically.
More importantly, they do not represent indigenous people either.
Indigenous peoples face several challenges from water
development projects:
They often lack a water supply and sanitation
services. In 2000, 42 percent of indigenous homes had no piped water and 70
percent had no sanitation services.
The water resources they use are
contaminated, for example through the irrigation of the Mezquital valley with
sewage from Mexico City.
There is continuing forced relocation of
indigenous and rural populations to make way for big dams for irrigation or
hydropower, such as in the Miguel Alemán and Cerro de Oro dams. This threatens
livelihoods, cultural bonds, archaeological sites and biodiversity.
There is no forum for indigenous peoples to
express their interests: watershed councils have proven wholly inadequate.
The legal mechanisms to claim rights over
territory are weak and indirect, especially when opposed by powerful companies
with ties to federal governments.
Depriving indigenous people access to water and involvement
in water resources management not only violates their rights, but also neglects
a vital source of traditional knowledge. To guarantee respect for indigenous
water rights, the author recommends working in three directions:
adopting a legal framework that fully recognises
the rights of indigenous peoples
including legitimate indigenous representatives
on water management bodies in the territories in which they live
forming social
coalitions amongst indigenous peoples and other rural populations so they can
better express their opposition to policies backed by powerful companies and
officials.

eldis:A36892;Transparency in oil rich economies;;"
Corruption is a serious problem in many developing countries that are rich in oil and other natural resources. This is central in explaining why resource rich countries perform badly in terms of socioeconomic development. Transparency has recently been viewed as a key factor in reducing corruption and other dysfunctions in natural resource rich countries. The paper addresses the relationship between transparency and corruption, with an emphasis on oil rich countries. It provides a systematic overview of the available literature and arguments on transparency and corruption before reviewing the literature on information, corruption and development, in a resource rich context. Finally, using the case of Angola, the report focuses on some of the main corruption related problems caused by limited access to information. It also looks at the approach of current transparency initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). In general the paper finds that transparency, or access to information, can have an effect on corruption. Transparency can reduce bureaucratic corruption by making corrupt acts more risky, by making it easier to provide good incentives to public officials, and by easing the selection of honest and efficient people for public service. Transparency can reduce political corruption by helping make politicians more accountable to the public.  ";"I. Kolstad

eldis:A40610;Future scenarios as a tool for collaboration in forest communities;;"This paper discusses how a participatory method to facilitate thinking about future scenarios can help change the way forest communities and local governments interact. It reviews a growing body of literature on future scenarios and shares first-hand experiences in forest communities in the northern Bolivian Amazon and the central provinces of Vietnam. This paper finds that under the right conditions, the use of future scenarios:

    allows forest communities to: collaborate more effectively with local governments, assume better responsibilities when given control over forests under devolution schemes and to become self-organised in order to benefit from the opportunities of communal control over forests
    helps communities to think about dependency, vulnerabilities and ways to prepare for the future. The methods develop organisational capacity and encourage internal democratic processes and planning. Community leaders become more vocal and assertive in meetings with local government, and marginalised groups within communities, such as women or the poorest segments, make their voices heard. 

However, the methods are less effective when facilitation skills are not available or where government or other interests are threatened by local constituents. Future scenarios are not without their pitfalls and do not work in all situations, but given the appropriate context they can create “break-through moments” that improve collaboration between communities and local officials. Key concluding points are:

    while forest devolution and government decentralisation trends in the tropics continue, forest communities are frequently unprepared for their new responsibilities and lack democratic decision making practices and capacity within their organisational structures 
    community forest management is viable only when communities can negotiate effectively with government, private enterprise and NGOs, and are accepted as equal partners in negotiations and decision making about the forest 
    future scenarios methods are promising means for assisting forest communities to find common ground, define collective interests, develop the skills and gain the experience they need to take proactive roles and benefit from forest devolution 
    participatory methods such as future scenarios alone are not sufficient to empower marginalised or remote communities, but they can help prepare communities for the challenges and opportunities of forest devolution.

eldis:A75990;Public policy reforms and indigenous forest governance: the case of the Yuracaré people in Bolivia ;;"This case study, published in the journal Conservation and Society, examines the impact of forest reforms in Bolivia on the indigenous Yuracaré people.

The recent surge in the efforts to reform forest governance-both through decentralisation and tenure reforms has been coupled by an increase in empirical studies that assess the virtues and limitations of the new regimes. Despite an increasing body of literature, however, there is still limited knowledge about the effects of these reforms on the indigenous groups and their forest governance institutions.

This study seeks to contribute to the empirical literature by analysing how policy reforms in Bolivia have affected one indigenous territory, its inhabitants, their de facto property rights regime, and their consequent efforts to govern their forest resources. The case study, about forest use decisions and actions among the Yuracaré people in the Bolivian lowlands, is an example of what the Amerindian indigenous societies face in terms of both opportunities and limitations associated with the implementation of formalised de jure rights over forests.

The authors pay particular attention to the effects of the 1996 forestry reforms on the institutional conditions for governing common-pool forests resources. The study draws on primary field data that were collected both before and after the implementation of the reforms. They find that the introduction of formal rights has led to increased security in tenure rights and the emergence of more opportunities for diversifying the sources of income for the Yuracaré people. But there are also significant costs associated with the achievement of these benefits. The reforms induced the Yuracaré people to integrate with the surrounding public and private economies, but the authors find that these interactions have strained traditional governance arrangements.

eldis:A62570;Land, Land Policy and Smallholder Agriculture in Ethiopia;;"By Samuel Gebreselassie
Land is a public property in Ethiopia. It has been administered by the government since the 1975 radical land reform. The reform brought to an end the exploitative type of relationship that existed between tenants and landlords. Tenants became own operators with use rights, but with no rights to sell, mortgage or exchange of land. The change of government in 1991 has brought not much change in terms of land policy. The EPRDF-led government that overthrew the Military government (Derg) in 1991 has inherited the land policy of its predecessor. Even though the new government adopted a free market economic policy, it has decided to maintain all rural and urban land under public ownership. The December 1994 Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia proclaimed that ‘Land is a common property of the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia and shall not be subject to sale or to other means of transfer’. Since the 1975 land reform, which made all rural land public property, the possession of land plots has been conditional upon residence in a village. The transfer of land through long-term lease or sales has been forbidden1, and government sponsored periodic redistribution, though, discouraged administratively since the early 1990s, has not been outlawed (Mulat, 1999).

eldis:A23913;The unresolved land reform debate: beyond state-led or market-led models;;"Sharp inequalities in the distribution of land remains a major cause of extreme poverty in many developing countries. Some instances are the result of ownership patterns inherited from colonial administrations, others are linked to the struggle for economic prosperity in the post-independence era.Landlessness is therefore a significant problem for the rural poor. Most remedies that have been undertaken previously have not yielded positive results, as can be witnessed in  Southern Africa today. This policy brief thus discusses how the land question can be addressed, through effective and equitable land reform policies.The paper examines some state-led models of land reform in various contexts, from Korea, Cuba and Bolivia to the Philippines and Japan. Market-led models, which tend to dominate the land reform arena, are also assessed. Examples include Brazil, Colombia and South Africa. The authors argue that the historical record shows neither state-led nor market-led land reform models have been wholly successful in removing these inequities.There is thus a need for an alternative model of land reform that could both satisfy legitimate and urgent demands for social justice and develop an agrarian system that is economically viable.  The authors propose a ""Distributive Alternative"" containing four components:The First Pillar: the rural poor need to establish their own independent organisations - mass mobilisation of the landless has, in many cases,  led to successful land reform programmesThe Second Pillar: a broad pro-reform political coalition should wield decisive political influence at the national level - reform efforts led by the poor require a base which is politically broad enough to ensure active state support for carrying through redistributionThe Third Pillar: genuine material support remains important - such as through public investment, state loans and technical assistanceThe Fourth Pillar: interventions are unlikely to succeed unless they are part of a growth-oriented development strategy - economic policies need to be geared towards pro-poor growth.

eldis:A69784;Fighting for land security in Southern Africa;;"It has emerged quite clearly from Urban LandMark’s work in South Africa – and increasingly in the region – that the emergence of more sophisticated property markets has taken place locally and in most larger cities in the region. While there might be a need to assist these markets to develop further, in particular the need to build market institutions and professions, these groupings tend to increase their own capacities as the markets develop, mostly with little assistance.

In the Southern Africa region, something more fundamental is needed. Most poor people, the majority in most cities and towns, do not have a legalised pathway to accessing land. They also do not have an administratively and legally supported way of holding onto land once they have accessed it – usually extra-legally, or in areas just beyond urban boundaries where land law becomes quasi- or fully customary. And nor do they have any way of then trading legally in property or use rights. As a result, many people occupy land or inadequate shelter illegally and are then constantly vulnerable to eviction, have little access to basic services, and are not part of the planning process of cities.

This study finds that entrenched urban poverty is as much a symptom of weak access to land and property as it is a cause. Therefore, upgrading settlements and incremental movement towards secure tenure for families living in poverty is a crucial part of building resilient livelihoods and communities in southern Africa. Markets are part of the picture if more fundamental inclusion of the poor into the urban economy is to be addressed, because it is about competition for valuable space and about (sustainable) participation in growing urban economies.

The paper observes that the issue of climate change is real stressin that where rapidly growing cities meet the effects of climate change, the future may well be bleak, especially if cities and towns in sub-Saharan Africa continue to be characterised by poverty, inequality and
weak institutions.

The author argues that if access to land, how land is held and how land is traded are not clearly defined (whether for residential or business purposes), one of the key building blocks for sustainable poverty alleviation and economic growth is missing. Similar to the argument for food security, land security is fundamental to development in the region. In order to achieve this, the paper concludes by recommending that comprehensive urban poverty strategies need to be linked to city development strategies.

It offers recommendations for the U.S. government and others involved in natural resource-rich countries emerging from conflict and also to the extractive industry companies and banking sectors that play a critical role in these states.Findings of the report include:unless deliberate efforts are made to avoid the resource curses, corruption, economic instability, conflict over the distribution of resource wealth and control of resource-rich areas will undermine peace building in war-torn countries rich in hydrocarbons and mineralselite groups who receive royalties and taxes paid by extractive industry companies have shown themselves consistently resistant to democratisationthe international community can play an important role in helping resource-rich states emerging from conflict manage the wealth that accrues from these resources, and can make proper wealth management a condition for donor assistanceit is essential that international missions and indigenous transitional governments immediately secure effective control of natural resource wealth (physical and monetary) and establish the laws, institutions, and capacity to manage that wealth transparently, accountably, and in ways that support reconstructionto be successful, the extractive industries and their bankers, the international financial institutions, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) must be brought into this process.Recommendations of the report include:the U.S. government and other outside governments should encourage key resource–rich countries to join and implement systems such as the EITI and the Kimberley Process. Countries where this step is relevant include Sudan, Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Iraqoutside governments should also invest in training and capacity building on natural resource wealth management issues both for diplomats and for governments/officials, media, and civil society in the resource-rich countriesoutside governments should explore the possibilities of discouraging governments and commercial banks from financing governments that do not meet agreed standards for natural resource wealth management.

eldis:A23914;Pushing beyond earth's limits;;"World grain production is a basic indicator of overall food security at the global level. Since 1984, world grain production has expanded more slowly than the world’s population. By the early years of the 21st century, consumption has outstripped production. Could these trends herald a new ""politics of scarcity""?In this article, the author sets out the evidence for his assertion that the world faces a future food security crisis.First, based on current trends, demand for grain will increase significantly over the coming years. It is predicted that the world’s population will grow by 3 billion over the next half-century. Furthermore, rising standards of living in some of the world’s most populous countries, such as India and China, are likely to see a shift towards consumption of more expensive – and more grain-intensive – foods, such as livestock.At the same time, however, the supply of grain will simultaneously decrease. This will be primarily as a result of environmental stresses and industrialisation and growth. Climate change is contributing to soil erosion and desertification of large tracts of previously arable grain-producing lands, while rises in temperature are predicted to reduce harvest yields. is reducing the world’s supply of water for irrigation. At the same time, as world demand for food has tripled, so too has the use of water for irrigation. Many major water tables that have been used to irrigate land are falling; water tables are now falling in countries that are home to more than half of the world’s people, including China, India, and the United States—the three largest grain producers.Economic growth has seen the loss of grain-growing land to non-farm uses such as housing and industry, and a shift of populations from rural to urban areas. Greater affluence has also resulted in a the conversion of land from grain production to the cultivation of more profitable agricultural produce such as vegetables and fruits.Rising food prices could be the first economic indicator to signal serious trouble in the deteriorating relationship between the global economy and the earth’s ecosystem. If these trends continue, the author warns, food insecurity may soon become the overriding concern of national governments.The chapter is taken from Lester R.

eldis:A11416;Civil society and the struggle for land rights for marginalised groups: the contribution of the Uganda Land Alliance to the Land Act 1998;;"The 1998 Land Act represents one of the most important pieces of legislation in Uganda, which is predominantly an agricultural country. The role of a consortium of NGOs, The Uganda Land Alliance (ULA), is analysed in this paper, with regard to the enactment of the Act. The issues addressed include:

    what the ULA's objectives were and the land issues it tackled
    how original the ULA was
    how significant the issues (and therefore clauses) addressed were to the protection of rights of the marginal groups
    how the ULA advanced its case and the limitations and strengths of its approaches
    what the lessons are that can be drawn from the struggle of the ULA to the theory of civil society

The paper is written in four sections:

    the first examines the objectives of the ULA and the issues it dealt with. A brief history of the evolution of land tenure is given to flesh out the issues that animated the land debate. In addition, the technical background to the land bill and its early critics is described.
    the second, examines the methods the ULA used to lobby for land rights of the poor
    the third examines the contribution and failures of the ULA and provides reasons why this was so
    the fourth relates the experience of the ULA to current notions about civil society and democratic governance

The author concludes that the ULA contributed in raising the awareness of the public. The author reflects possible long term consequences of that consciousness rising will empower those who suffer the brunt of bad policies to act to change them. However, the author notes that the ability of organisations such as ULA to push for democratic governance is dependent on the political and economic context.
The author outlines the limitations of civil society and its influence on state policy, suggesting thatcivil society organisation registered with the state can only contribute reformist programmes to the governance of the country. The author believes that as long as pluralism is circumscribed by laws that prohibit freedom of association and the right to dissent, civil society organisations acting within the framework of the law can have only a limited contribution.

eldis:A74489;Transnational agrarian movements struggling for land and citizenship rights ;;"Rural citizens have increasingly begun to invoke perceived citizenship rights at transnational level, such that rural citizen engagements today have the potential to generate new meanings of global citizenship.

La Vía Campesina has advocated for, created and occupied a new citizenship space that did not exist before at the global governance terrain – a public space distinct for poor peasants and small farmers from the global South and North. La Vía Campesina’s transnational campaign in protest against neoliberal land policies is a good illustration of this in the sense that rural citizens of different countries collectively invoke their rights to define what land and land reform mean to them, struggle for their rights to have rights in reframing the terms of the global land policymaking, and demand accountability from international development institutions. It has been inherently linked with campaigns for land and citizenship rights. One of the outcomes of this initiative is that the public space created and occupied by various civil society groups got expanded. Such space has also been rendered much more complex, with the subsequent creation of various layers of sub-spaces of interactions.

eldis:A75340;Land reform and changes in land ownership concentration: evidence from rice-growing villages in the Philippines ;;"Land reform has been the main policy response of government to correct the sharp inequalities in the distribution of land ownership in the Philippines. The historical records show that the process of disposal of State lands has heavily favored households with economic and political power. These households had undue advantage over the common populace in acquiring property rights through the Spanish system of royal grants and the American system of land cadastre. The result has been the ownership of big landholdings by few families and the rise of haciendas or family estates comprising several hundreds and thousands of hectares.

This paper examines the effect of land reform and land transfer actions of farmer beneficiaries on land ownership concentration. A case study of two rice-growing villages was used to track down ownership changes over a period of time. Land reform has succeeded in the break up of huge estates in rice-growing villages but has not effectively improved land ownership concentration due to evasions tactics of landlords who have retained a significant portion of lands to the family through land schemes that are apparently legitimate under the land reform laws. Land transfer actions of farmer beneficiaries have not necessarily worsen the current land ownership concentration but in the absence of progressive land tax, these actions can lead to widening land concentration.

It challenges the view that property rights and markets by themselves will transform rural areas where people are in deep crisis due to unemployment, corruption, food insecurity and HIV/AIDS.The brief maintains that workable arrangements to negotiate and find productive and just solutions to diverse interests and potentially divisive conflicts might be attainable if the institutions which take charge of transferred land are given power and capabilities that go beyond land and are linked to appropriate levels of local governance. ;"P.

eldis:A73212;Potential impact of climate and socioeconomic changes on future agricultural land use in West Africa;;"This study compares the contributions of climate change and socioeconomic development to potential future changes of agricultural land use in West Africa.

It uses a prototype land use projection (LandPro) algorithm which is based on a balance between food supply and demand, and accounts for the impact of socioeconomic drivers on the demand side and the impact of climate-induced crop yield changes on the supply side. It considers the impact of human decision-making on land use.

The paper argues that without agricultural intensification, the climate-induced decrease in crop yield together with increase in food demand are found to cause a significant increase in agricultural land use at the expense of forest and grassland by the mid-century. The increase in agricultural land use is primarily climate-driven in the western part of West Africa and socioeconomically driven in the eastern part. Analysis of results suggests that human adaptation characterized by science-informed decision making to minimize land use could be very effective in many parts of the region.

eldis:A24466;Mining in the Philippines: concerns and conflicts;;This report explores the effects of mining in the Philippines. The report argues that mining in the Philippines is being developed at a speed and in a manner likely to cause massive long-term environmental damage and social problems.The report finds that: current mining plans will undermine the Government’s own strategy for sustainable development by destroying or severely damaging critical eco-systems, including watersheds, rivers, marine eco-systems and important agricultural production areasimplementation of the proposed mining plan will bring insufficient benefits to the Filipino peoplecorruption is a serious problem in the Philippines and it can be expected that plans for extensive mining operations in remote areas requiring licensing, regulation and monitoring will make it worsethe Philippines currently faces a crisis of extra-judicial killings. More than 700 activists – including civil rights and environmental advocates – have been killed since the current administration came to power in 2001.The report recommends that: the Philippine government should cancel all current mining applications that will inevitably cause major environmental damage to critical watersheds, eco-systems, agriculture or fisheries and result in social disruptionthe Philippine government should revoke the Mining Act of 1995 and enact alternative legislation that more effectively protects the interests of the affected local communities, indigenous peoples and the environmentthe World Bank Group should halt its promotion and support for mining expansion in the Philippines under current conditionsall mining projects should be inspected by reputable independent organisations before investment. ;"C.

eldis:A15524;NGOS: fighting poverty, hurting the poor;;"In this short, polemical article, the author argues that NGO advocacy groups are acting against the interests of the poor and of international development through unreasonable criticism of the World Bank and similar agencies. The author argues that, in a typical situation, the Bank designs a reasonable project, which inevitably has flaws. NGOs seize on these flaws and add a large sprinkling of inflammatory rhetoric. The World Bank pulls out, but the project goes ahead anyway, without the Bank's social and environmental safeguards.The author illustrates this with three case studies: Bujagali Dam, Uganda: the World Bank was promoting a dam. The International Rivers Network (based in the USA), campaigned internationally against the programme on the grounds that the Ugandan environmental movement was severely critical of the project. However,  the author's own investigation suggested that the Ugandan NGO group was very small and that  the villagers affected by the dam were happy to accept compensation and relocate, and a valuable projects was   held up for fear of activist resistanceQinghai relocation programme, China/Tibet: this project was designed to move 58,000 water-poor farmers to an area  irrigated by a small dam.  Qinghai borders on the Chinese administrative division known as the Tibet Autonomous Region, which covers part of historical Tibet and 1 million of Qinghai's 5 million inhabitants are Tibetan. Although no Tibetans currently lived in the immediate settlement area,  Bank officials argued that the project would help the 3,500 Tibetans who would move to newly irrigated land, and that Tibetans who stayed behind would benefit from reduced population pressure in their own area. The Tibet Information Network formed an international coalition of NGOs opposing the programme, resulting in a range of protests based, the author claims, on inaccurate and increasingly simplified information. The resulting pressure on the US government forced the Bank to re-assess the project through its Inspection Panel, a panel which (the author argues) was under similar pressure to find technical infringements of the Bank's safeguard policies than in asking the big questions of ""Would the Qinghai project reduce poverty?"". This lead to China informed the bank that it would withdraw its request for financing. However, the Chinese government pressed ahead with the resettlement project by itself, ignoring the Bank's environmental conditions and disclosure requirements and moved more people to the new area. Camisea gas pipeline, Peru: a project of the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), where most of the  IDB board of directors concluded that, on balance, IDB involvement would decrease the project's environmental and social impact. The US board member however blocked the programme due to NGO campaigning suggesting that two firms linked to US President George W. Bush's administration would  profit from the project, and that environmental concerns were being ignored in order to reward cronies. The effect of this was that of the 46 governments on the IDB's board, the only one not to vote for the project was the one with links to these companiesThe author concludes that:campaigning NGOs (as distinct from those with real development programs in the field) are not open to compromise. They have to be radical: if they stop denouncing big organizations, nobody will send them cash or quote them in the newspapers.  NGOs claim to hold the World Bank accountable, yet the bank is answerable to the governments who are its shareholders. It is the NGOs' accountability that is murky.on finance, some level of conditionality is essential, but under pressure from NGOs, the World Bank is insisting  upon perfectionist safeguards. Because of the high cost and delays of doing business with the bank, countries with the option of borrowing on private capital markets increasingly do so, without the environmental and other safeguards that the Bank would have imposed on them.projects in dozens of countries are similarly held up for fear of activist resistance. Feisty internet-enabled groups make scary claims about the iniquities of development projects. Time after time, Western publics raised on stories of World Bank white elephants believe them. Lawmakers in European parliaments and the U.S. Congress accept NGO arguments at face value, and the government officials who sit on the World Bank's board respond by blocking funding for deserving projects the Bank is taking a stronger, counter-attacking line with NGOs, on the basis that it can not win over every critic. Examples of this are seen in the recent rejection of recommendations from joint Bank/NGO advisory bodies, such as the Commission on Dams and Commission on Extractive Industries which, it argued, set unfeasibly demanding targetsconstant campaigning threatens to disable not just the World Bank but regional development banks and governmental aid organizations. If this takes place, the world may lose the potential for good that big organizations offer: to rise above the single-issue advocacy and address larger scale, complex problems[adapted from author] Access to this article is available:on  the Foreign Policy website at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/files/story2672.php (payment may be required)on the KeepMedia website as part of a free, trial membership offer for new users (registration required), at http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/ForeignPolicy/2004/09/01/564802 ";S.

eldis:A12661;Tenure security and land-related investment: evidence from Ethiopia;;Report finds that land rights in Ethiopia are highly insecure, and  higher tenure security and transferability could enhance investment and agricultural productivity. Trying to identify and implement measures to increase producers’ tenure security could have a large pay-off in terms of rural productivity and poverty reduction.The authors use a large data set from Ethiopia that differentiates tenure security and transferability to explore determinants of different types of land-related investment and its possible impact on productivity. There is some support for endogeneity of investment in trees, this is not the case for terraces. Transfer rights are unambiguously investment-enhancing. The large productivity effect of terracing implies that, even where households undertake investments to increase their tenure security, this may not be socially efficient. The report findings suggest:  the impact of land rights on investment incentives varies significantly across different types of improvements and the balance between their productivity- and security-enhancing effect. This implies that, even in situations where households undertake certain investments (eg tree planting) with the express purpose of enhancing tenure security,  government interventions to better define and enforce land rights may still be useful. While registration of land rights without prior legal clarification of the nature of such rights may not increase tenure security, a clear policy statement as to the nature of land rights would not only do so but could also provide tenure security in a more-cost effective way, thereby freeing households to focus on truly productivity-enhancing activities.In Ethiopia, transferability had a larger impact than tenure security on households’ investment incentives. Exploration of the determinants of households’ perception of their land rights would be of interest to uncover possible reasons underlying this rather surprising phenomenon and the implications it has for land policy. Research is also needed on the  scope, determinants, and impact of different modalities of land transfers would be warranted.in addition to the robustness of the investment-enhancing impact of greater tenure security and transferability of land rights across specifications, the magnitude and potential productivity-enhancing impact of this effect is surprising and in contrast to most of the recent literature which finds that investment effects, if at all significant, are often quantitatively very small. Although most of these conclusions are based on short term investments using relatively small and regionally concentrated samples. Methodologically, it would be of considerable interest to explore whether a focus on investment with a longer gestation period, incorporation of producers’ subjective perception of their land rights, and greater regional variation, may lead to a revision  f the conclusions from this literature in other African countries as well.[adapted from author] ;"B.

eldis:A40471;Analytical situations of land degradation and sustainable management strategies in Africa;;"In the face of trends towards a widening “food gap” and general poverty, this paper attempts to address the problem by discussing the methodologies necessary for sustainable land management to ensure improved food security, rapid economic development and poverty reduction in developing countries of Africa. The authors explain that the population of the world has been increasing at an exponential rate over the past few decades. Present projections suggest that it will be 11 billion by the year 2100. Population increases in developing African countries are at an upward trend too and most of these human populations live in urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Sustainable land management strategies are discussed in relation to:

    information, monitoring and assessment
    social issues relating to stakeholders participation and capacity building
    policy issues
    soil productivity restoration. 

All these strategies are to control and/or mitigate land degradation. It should be noted however, that sustainability as used in this document entails that natural resources and infrastructure be properly managed so that applied practices do not cause degradation and/or pollution, while a stable economy is achieved. Key concluding points and recommendations include:

    the importance of addressing land use planning and management through a holistic approach such as ecosystem-based management cannot be overemphasised 
    there is need for access and rights to land, water and other natural resources, as well as the need for national and local measures to protect critical natural resources. it is important that social and health aspects of land use systems should be integrated in the overall planning process 
    there is an urgent need for appropriate policies, frameworks and measures to change production/ consumption systems into sustainable ones so as to combat land degradation, desertification, deforestation and loss of biodiversity and therefore improve food security, alleviate poverty and mitigate the effects of climatic change on population 
    equal access and the security of land tenure including for women, poor people, indigenous and local communities have to be guaranteed by policies and laws. Adequate land administration systems must also be developed to support sustainable land tenure. The participatory approach is strongly encouraged for land tenure reform processes and for the planning and management of land resources.

eldis:A25968;Promoting Farm Investment for Sustainable Intensification of  African Agriculture;;Key findings and policy implications discussed in this document—Promoting Farm Investment for Sustainable Intensification of African Agriculture— include the following: Farmers are much more likely to invest in both productivity and land protection when they can produce cash crops. Livestock husbandry is a boon to farm investments, as it provides cash income, manure, and an insurance policy against crop failures. Land tenure insecurity, political instability, policy caprice, and wildly fluctuating farm prices dissuade investment. Complementary infrastructure, often built by villages or national governments, is crucial. Furthermore, rural nonfarm busi-nesses are a crucial source of funds for farm investments, especially since the dismantlement of public credit programs. ;;;Development Experience Clearinghouse, USAID;eldis;01/01/1996;en;"agriculture;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A25968;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADF592.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpdf.usaid.gov%2Fpdf_docs%2FPNADF592.pdf;;;;"Food and agriculture markets;Microcredit;nonfarm employment;Governance;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;Labour and employment;Microcredit2"
eldis:A60367;Regional approaches to food and water security in the face of climate challenges;;"A workshop held in Midrand, South Africa, in May 2011 brought together policy and decision-makers, researchers and practitioners to discuss water security issues in eastern and southern Africa. This proceedings document summarises the workshop's outcomes with the aim of: 

    improving the understanding of water security 
    identifying opportunities to better address challenges faced by individual countries and sectors
    highlighting areas for further research 
    identifying immediate opportunities for development projects.

The document outlines the current situation in the region, providing a global context of the threats and opportunities faced by Africa. The first part of the document presents talks given during the workshop. Research on sustainable livelihoods in corporate supply chains and the pros and cons of both hydropower and regional cooperation were were among the topics discussed.
Following the talks, the workshop's discussion centred around the following three themes.

    Pro-poor approaches in land and water, including issues surrounding states indifference to the voiceless poor, the need for donors and states to align long-term goals and supplement each other’s work and questions regarding the role of the private sector. 
    Can energy and finance dynamise agriculture and water management? Concerns about the private agricultural sector, hydropower and dams persist, so these cannot be regarded as magic bullets. New investment by the BRIC countries may help to halt the increase in coal powered energy plants. 
    What interventions are needed in trade and markets? Among the issues discussed were the incompatible national standards for electricity, a need for greater cooperation and the question of finance. The discussants concluded that substantial barriers mean that rapid progress is unlikely and the outcomes are uncertain. Markets, trade and harmonisation will be significant enablers and an important step will be to encourage further public discussion on the practical benefits that could result from more focused investment.

eldis:A12660;The politics of rural land use planning in China;;Looks at the allocation of land for specific purposes in the integrated land use plans that have come into effect across China since 1998..The paper:  presents an analysis of the development of policies on national land use planning since the promulgation of the first Land Law in 1986. draws on fieldwork data collected in Taicang municipality/county, southern Jiangsu in early 2001 in order to compare the national picture with the role that land has played in policies and practices of economic development there at the county, township and village levels.The paper concludes that uniform national land use policies do not work. Proscribing land use for non-agricultural purposes is arguably vital as a form of social welfare to guarantee the livelihood of the rural population in poorer areas that rely mainly on subsistence agriculture, but hamstrings the development of highly commercialised areas such as Taicang. ;F.

eldis:A26792;The determinants of agricultural production : a cross-country analysis;;Capital is important to agricultural production, so policies that improve access to agricultural capital will facilitate growth, if the capital is used efficiently. In this analysis of capital's role in agricultural production, a new construction of data on capital allowed Mundlak, Larson, and Butzer to advance the cross-country study of production functions. The model reveals the relative importance of capital, a finding quite robust to modifications of the model and the disaggregation of capital to its two components. The model is also consistent with the view that lack of physical capital serves as a constraint on agricultural growth. The shift to more productive techniques is associated with a decline in labor, reflecting labor-saving technical changes. This is not news, but it is emphasized here because it comes out of an integral view of the process which distinguishes between the core technology and the changes that took place over time and between countries.  Not only is capital important to agricultural production, and agricultural development dependent on the economic environment, but agriculture is more cost-capital-intensive than nonagriculture. Capital is all the more important as a factor of production in that land (also important) varies little over time. The availability of agricultural capital determines whether the gap between available and applied technologies can be closed. Prices have little direct, immediate impact on agricultural growth, beyond their impact through inputs and choice of technology. The legacy of past policies that distorted the relative returns to economic activity is enshrined in current stocks, which may respond slowly to policy reform. The analysis assumes that the production technology is heterogeneous and the implemented technology is endogenous and determined jointly with the level of unconstrained inputs. Thus, a change in the state variables affects both the technology and the inputs, so the production function is not identified. To overcome that problem, changes in productivity are decomposed to three orthogonal components caused by the fundamentally different processes underlying panel data.  The statistical framework explains the unstable results observed in production functions derived from panel data. Statistically, the results depend on how the data are projected. Comparisons between units over time or of deviations from unit-means or time-means all describe different processes. This is based on theory but has an intuitive appeal as well. In this case, the spread in productivity among countries is different from the spread in productivity for a country through time. The factors explaining the spread will differ. The modeling approach should explicitly recognize the fact that panel data measure a combination of economic phenomena. [author] ;"Yair Mundlak

eldis:A67702;Improved land management in the Lake Victoria basin: annual technical report July 2001 to June 2002;;"This report addresses the challenges of land management in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. In 1999 the World Agroforestry Centre launched a major effort to identify, diagnose and reverse degradation in the Lake Victoria basin, focusing primarily on the Kenyan part of the basin. Dubbed “TransVic,” this project was supported by a number of donor agencies and collaborators, with particularly strong support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Field activities in the Kenyan part of the basin were undertaken with Kenya’s National Agriculture and Livestock Extension Programme. This report summarizes the major achievements of TransVic from 1999 to the end of 2004. The project greatly improved understanding of land degradation processes, costs and hotspots, the linkages between poverty, degradation and water resource management, and the possibilities for and constraints to solving those problems through various technical and institutional approaches. The research and development agenda for the region is now able to concentrate on the investments in land and water resources that can curtail degradation and help restore these degraded resources.

Land reforms have been central to strategies to improve the asset base of the poor in developing countries thought their effectiveness has been hindered by political constraints on implementation. In this paper we use panel data on the sixteen main Indian states from 1958 to 1992 to consider whether the large volume of land reforms as have been legislated have had an appreciable impact on growth and poverty. The evidence presented suggests that land reforms do appear to be associated with poverty reduction. [author] ;"T. Besley

eldis:A101664;Integrated marine and coastal management in the western Indian Ocean: towards a sustainable oceans economy;;The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region has valuable and diverse coastal and marine resources, but much of its natural capital is either threatened or declining. The WIO encompasses rich diverse tropical and subtropical areas along the coastlines of Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa. This region also comprises vast oceanic areas and the island states of Madagascar, Seychelles, Comoros, Mauritius and Réunion. This paper focuses on the marine and coastal governance of mainland states in the region. As countries in the WIO region gear for a sustainable oceans economy, there is an urgent need for effective tools to ensure the resilience of coastal and marine biodiversity, to regulate sustainable resource use and to protect the livelihoods of millions of people. To achieve this, anticipatory approaches such as ecosystem-based, integrated resource management and coastal and marine spatial planning need to be used to promote sustainable Blue Economy pathways in the WIO, and facilitate the management of ecosystems and biodiversity in regional spatial planning. This essentially consists of designating and expanding effective marine protected areas (MPAs) and other priority areas for conservation, as well as including community-based models for sustainable management.This paper addresses some key governance challenges in the WIO region related to the inclusive management needed to ensure that resource management approaches, specifically in and around MPAs, produce outcomes for nature and for people. Key to their success is the ability to demonstrate and enhance socio-economic development benefits and to communicate these benefits through thorough economic valuations. Attention must focus not only on expanding protected areas’ coverage but also on enhancing the capacity of management agencies and communities to govern conservation spaces effectively and attract sustainable, long-term financing. Collaborative partnerships around the conservation and sustainable management of in-shore marine resourcescan significantly contribute to meeting the region’s national development targets, the AU’s Agenda 2063, the commitments set out in the 2030 global development agenda and the Aichi targets of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity. ;R.

eldis:A23482;Key terms used in greenhouse gas reporting and accounting for the land use, land use change and forestry sector;;This paper provides an overview of interpretations of key terms related to land use, land-use change and forest, and harvested wood products (LULUCF). It represents a consensus achieved by participating experts, and collates definitions of key terms commonly used in relation to greenhouse gas reporting and accounting. It also highlights areas of ambiguity and divergent interpretations and demonstrates existing interpretations of several key terms at the national level, under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol.The paper highlights:key terms for reporting and accounting: emission, source, sink, reservoir, reporting, accountingkey concepts for reporting under the Kyoto Protocol, the Marrakesh Accords, UNFCC, and LULUCFguidelines on carbon in wood products: wood products in national inventory reporting, cross-boundary movements of carbon through mechanisms other than Harvested Wood Products (HWP) trade, wood products accounting under the Kyoto ProtocolThe paper concludes that one set of interpretations sees emissions and removals to be approximated by a change in carbon stocks in a number of selected carbon pools. In contrast, another set of interpretations views emissions and removals as gross fluxes between the atmosphere and the land / wood products system. ;"A. Cowie

eldis:A69952;Land tenure: issues in housing reconstruction and income poverty case study of earthquake-affected areas in Hazara ;;"There are many commendable successes with respect to relief, recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation to assist the earthquake affected districts of North West Frontier Province3 and Azad Kashmir. The same, however, cannot be said unambiguously about housing reconstruction. Partly, the obstacles are rooted in Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) rigid procedures. In many areas, though, housing reconstruction has also become mired in the traditional land tenure regime.

This paper deals primarily with issues of land tenure, its impact on housing compensation benefit incidence and ERRA’s handling of the matter. It also looks at the income implications of land tenure patterns and compares the situation in Hazara with that in Azad Kashmir. The study is based on a survey of two affected districts in Hazara: Mansehra and Batagram.

Obstacles in housing reconstruction and low employability and incomes both are outcomes of land tenure related constraints. While the early response to the earthquake was excellent, the rehabilitation effort has been less successful on account of deeper structural problems that the earthquake has aggravated. The situation not only provides an opportunity to rebuild houses, but also presents an opening to improve the land tenure equation and, as the Azad Kashmir case shows, create the conditions for enhancing incomes and for realizing the region’s economic potential. There is, thus, a case for land reform.

Any mention of land reform generally brings to mind a scenario where the landowner is removed and ownership is transferred to the cultivating tenant. This does not necessarily emerge as the preferred option in Hazara. Given the already small unit size of farms, even of farms reported as self-cultivated, transfer of ownership to tenants is likely to further reduce land size and lock the rural economy at the subsistence level. It may, therefore, be more feasible to consider measures to removing the tenant and turning farms into self-cultivated units.

The larger self-cultivated farms are likely to be more efficient and accrue greater income for the landowners. The displaced tenants in Hazara can be expected to be absorbed in the new industrial/tourist sector in the area. The strategy is likely to inject an element of dynamism in the local economy and provide employment opportunities to local labor force, instead of leaving them with little choice but to look for employment as expatriate labor in other areas of the country and abroad.

eldis:A33927;The impact of extractive industry activities on the rights of local communities;;"Does Anvil Mining, a multinational company which has been extracting copper since 2002 from a mine in Dikulushi impact positively or negatively on the lives or rights of the local populations? The study argues that the impact of Anvil has been not been as problematic compared to other mining companies as the company has been adhering to relevant national and international norms and standards such as the OECD guiding principles. The study also points out that the authorities need to do more to makes sure international and national standards and norms are respected.
Key findings include: 

    the social projects developed by Anvil Mining are not sustainable in that, to this day, they are conceived and managed by the company with no involvement by the communities in the actual mechanics of their management, neither during nor after the mining is completed 
    currently, Anvil Mining has no programme which could allow it to contribute in any coherent manner to the development of the communities of Dikulushi 
    due to certain social projects, some rights of the community have been improved (health, employment, clean drinking water, and a secure working environment) while other rights have been negatively affected, or have not seen much improvement (rhousing, ownership of property, healthy environment) 

The authors recommend that Anvil Mining:

    carries out its activities in accordance with the national and international norms relating to mining
    devises a development programme for local communities who are affected by the mining project, in consultation with the beneficiaries, which is in accordance with the guiding principles of the OECD, the mining code, and the mining regulations of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
    makes this programme available to the local communities and civil society, with the aim of allowing them to establish its conditions 
    promotes involvement by members of the local community, religious and traditional leaders, and local authorities in the conceptualisation and fulfilment of social project

The research lists current projects in Africa to build a database of REDD initiatives and their status of implementation. The main issues addressed are: the political and institutional challenges and prospects for REDD; the technical challenges and prospects for REDD; social and economic challenges; resource and funding issues; and performance monitoring/reporting metrics being developed. It highlights the risk in focusing only on the heavily forested Congo Basin area, instead of also addressing deforestation in non-forested ecosystems. Moreover, the magnitude and extent of forest cover change in Africa is less than in tropical America and south east Asia. Hence, the potential to reverse these trends may still be less challenging in Africa than in other parts of the world. This presents a real opportunity for forest investment. ";C.

eldis:A11921;The great water robbery;;Water is a precious resource and nowadays it is becoming more and more limited. In order to cope with this situation, privatisation of water services has been promoted and it is has become a compulsory precondition for developing countries, who want to access World Bank and IMF’ s funds for water and sanitation programmes.This paper compares two contrasting views:water is a basic human right that every state should guarantee to its citizenswater is an economic  good –a commodity – that should be governed by market forces The main consequence of water services privatisation is that water will become a privilege only of those who can pay high prices, by excluding a priori the poor. Empirical evidence suggests that generally water privatisation in developing countries has been led by foreign multinational companies. In addition, although a privatised water industry could lead to an increased efficiency, it should be taken into account that it needs an effective regulation, which is not a common characteristic in developing countries.Therefore, the paper concludes that the responsibility for water services should rest with governments and the democratic and accountable system of governance is a prerequisite for equitable approach to water services. ;G.

eldis:A59077;Technologies for climate change adaptation: agriculture sector;;"The agriculture sector faces the challenge of providing adequate food to a growing world population. There is limited scope to expand arable land, and unpredictable weather, floods, and other disastrous events make food production even more challenging. This guidebook provides information on 22 technologies and options for adapting to climate change in the agriculture sector. It describes what policymakers, development planners, agriculture experts and other stakeholders should consider while determining a technology development path in agriculture.Technologies listed in the document cover the following topic areas.

    Planning for climate change and variability.
    Sustainable water use and management.
    Soil management.
    Sustainable crop management.
    Sustainable livestock management.
    Sustainable farming systems.
    Capacity building and stakeholder organisation.

The guidebook advises that decision-making processes should be participative, facilitated and consensus-building, and they should be based on the following key guiding principles.

    Increasing awareness and knowledge.
    Strengthening institutions.
    Protecting natural resources.
    Providing financial assistance.
    Developing context-specific strategies.

 
    The paper suggests the following criteria for the prioritisation of adaptation technologies.
    
        The extent to which the technology strengthens environmentally sustainable biological diversity.
        The extent to which the technology facilitates access to climate change information.
        Whether the technology supports water, carbon and nutrient cycles, and enables increased productivity.
        Income-generating potential, cost-benefit analysis and contribution to improved equity.
        Respect for cultural diversity and facilitation of inter-cultural exchange.
        Potential for integration into regional and national policies and upscaling.
        The extent to which the technology builds formal and informal institutions and social networks.
    
    The guidebook makes the following recommendations for practitioners and policymakers.
    
        There is a need for improved climate modeling and forecasting for better informed decision-making and the implementation of adaptation strategies.
        Information should be gathered to better understand the behaviour of plants, animals, pests and diseases as they react to climate change.
        Potential changes in economic and social systems in the future under different climate scenarios should also be investigated so that the implications of adaptation strategy and planning choices are better understood.
        It is important to secure effective flows of information through appropriate dissemination channels.
        Improved analysis of adaptation technologies to build adaptive capacity and resilience in the agriculture sector. 
        Relationships between policymakers, researchers and communities should be built so that technologies and planning processes are developed in partnership.

eldis:A16282;A conflict of interests: the uncertain future of Burma's forests;;"Burma is resource rich, and principal among these resources is timber. This report, based on research and fieldwork carried out by Global Witness  in Burma, Thailand and China, examines the roots of the civil war and how conflict and an authoritarian regime (the State Peace and Development Council - SPDC) have been sustained through the exploitation of Burma’s natural resources.The paper argues that Burma is the epitome of unrealised potential - a poor country rich in natural resources and social capital. Historically struggles over the control of natural resources have been a primary cause of war in Burma  and addressing both ethnic concerns and the manner in which natural resources are exploited will be pivotal for the future of peace and development in the country.The report makes a number of recommendations to key players, including action points for the international community:increase the provision of aid directly to the people of Burma, following stakeholder consultation, in a way that prevents its diversion and that does not perpetuate military rule and human rights abuseprovide support for Burmese independent NGOs, in the form of technical assistance, to raise their capacity to administer their humanitarian programmes and to manage increasing levels of foreign funding.To achieve equitable and sustainable management of Burma’s forests, the International Community should:ensure that timber imported from Burma does not fund conflict, or lead to human rights abuse or increased poverty, and that it is harvested from a legal, sustainably managed source and produced in accordance with Burma’s international obligationsmake all data relating to the importation of timber from Burma publicly available; including volumes, value, and originFacilitate a forest sector review and forest value assessment, to determine how to protect and sustainably manage all of Burma’s forests in the best interests of the people of Burma. This should include a forest cover survey and meaningful public consultation.In relation to the equitable and sustainable management of Burma’s forests, the SPDC should:implement the results of the proposed forest sector review and forest value assessment, increase transparency and accountability. This should include the cessation of all unsustainable logging practices and logging that is detrimental to the best interests of the peoples of Burmaensure the formal participation of local communities in the decision-making process relating to forest conservation and exploitation.[adapted from author] ";;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"environment;conflict of interest";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16282;http://www.globalwitness.org/reports/index.php?section=burma;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Freports%2Findex.php%3Fsection%3Dburma;;;;"Burma;Business and conflict;biodiversity;Conflict and security;geopolitics;New wars;ethical business;Drivers of conflict;Environment;Business and the environment;natural resources as driver of conflict;Corporate Social Responsibility;Biodiversity and environment;Security;natural resource;conflict;timber"

eldis:A25446;Is growth in Bangladesh's rice production sustainable?;;"The current level of per capita production of rice in Bangladesh can be sustained only through increased yields of modern rice varieties.The recent growth of food grain (primarily rice) production in Bangladesh has outpaced population growth largely because of the spread of green revolution technology. The transition from being labeled a ""basket case"" in the early 1970s to the virtual elimination of rice imports in the early 1990s is particularly remarkable considering the severe land constraint in Bangladesh. Two decades of concerted government efforts to achieve rice self-sufficiency have created both an atmosphere of optimism and concerns about whether rice self-sufficiency is sustainable.Baffes and Gautam find that rice production grew in Bangladesh between 1973 and 1994 mainly because of the conversion of rice growing areas from local to modern varieties. Simulations suggest that the current level of per capita production can be sustained only through increased yields from modern rice varieties.Other factors that could affect growth in per capita rice production are population control (which is found to have significant long-term benefits) and faster conversion of remaining areas to modern varieties (which is found to have important short run payoffs).But population control and faster conversion to modern varieties are only complements for the most important factor: efforts to increase the yields from modern rice varieties. If policies designed to raise the overall rate of economic growth and reduce poverty succeed, it will be even more critical to focus on increasing productivity.This paper, a product of the Commodity Policy and Analysis Unit, International Economics Department - is part of a larger effort in the department to analyze global food security issues.

It argues that that conflict has grown rapidly in Africa in the least three decades, and pastoral areas are among the most vulnerable. For this reason, there is an urgent need for a stocktaking of contemporary analysis of conflict. This paper  maps the state of knowledge, to identifies important gaps in understanding, and suggests promising avenues for future practical work.It specifically explores the literature referring to pastoral conflict in north Kenya, concerning:the prominent actors involved in the conflict inthe importance of the national political situationthe effect of international influencesthe outcomes of pastoral conflictthe construction of a typology of violent pastoral conflictmajor changes in pastoral conflict over timethe importance of the advent of automatic weaponsdifferent analytical perspectives on conflict over resource tenure and usethe breakdown of the ability of customary institutions to manage conflictthe potential role in pastoral conflict for agenciesThe literature synthesises typical recommendations made in order to establish more efficient conflict management mechanisms. These include:give support to participatory  development  planning to  prepare conflict  management components of wider development plans and policies, and to assess the likely impact of development activities on conflictintegrate conflict management and reduction goals and activities into the national poverty eradication plan as it is implemented, especially: incorporate conflict management considerations into pilot field demonstration projects and into selection of geographic and sector targets for the plan; provide training on conflict management within wider poverty training for senior civil servantsdevelop strategies and methods for more successful development in conflict-prone arid districts, including improved natural resource tenure, food security, marketing and creditsupport preparation of case studies of the links between conflict and povertyexplore regional support to conflict managementdevelop a conflict impact analysis procedure for all new projects ";"S.

eldis:A62700;The Marital Immigrant. Land, and Agricultue: A Malawian Case Study;;The central and southern regions of Malawi predominantly follow matrilineal succession and inheritance and practice uxorilocal marriages. Women, rather than men, own the primary land rights. Colonial government officials and some Eurocentric scholars have argued that the system of uxorilocal marriages and female ownership of land rights are inimical to agricultural development principally because men lose the motivation to make long term investments in land which does not belong to them. This study of marital immigrants sought to investigate whether the location of land rights in someone other than themselves affected the wax they viewed agriculture and made farm decisions. It found that while short term decisions are not affected, long term investments are influenced by perception of security, understood in terms of marital stability. ;P.

eldis:A69599;Overview of urban land as a commodity in South Africa: research findings and recommendations;;Urban land can be defined as a commodity that is traded or as a right that is used to obtain access to urban amenities. Both are important components of urban land. Land is considered to be a commodity when it is bought and sold freely and a right to which all members of society should have access whether they are rich or poor. This report provides an analysis of both the formal and informal property markets for urban land in South Africa. The formal market which comprises of Suppliers: developers, land owners and contractors, Consumers: upper and middle-income households and individuals, Transaction Agents: estate agents and conveyancers and Regulators: Register of Deeds and Municipalities is basically focused on accumulation of assets. The extent to which any of the actors benefit from the operation of the market depends upon the investment decisions that they make within the context of their operating environment. Generally, low-income households are not able to enter and transact in this market due to lack of resources to compete for and invest in these lands. Several government interventions to give the poor access to these markets have had some successes and failures. On the other hand, the informal land market comprises of Suppliers: property owners and facilitators, Consumers: low-income households and individuals, Transaction agents: Facilitators, speculators, community organisations & leaders and Regulators: Local Government and the police. This market is primarily focused on land use. The study states that the formal and informal markets operate side by side and government efforts to push them closer together have been thwarted by high regulations and transaction costs and a lack of access to finance. In conclusion, the study recommends that while the informal market provides access for low-income households, it is desirable to expand the access frontier of the formal land market to include as many low-income households as possible. The reason for this is that the formal land market allows low-income households to generate wealth. Accordingly, interventions in the land market should focus on reducing the polarisation between the two markets and increasing symbiosis. This should be done by increasing the basis by which low-income households can participate in the formal market and increasing the formality of the informal property market. The ideal is to have one market where formal and informal overlap substantially. ;"R. Gordon

eldis:A26314;Grappling with land reform in pastoral Namibia;;This article discusses the history of land reform in Namibia. The article indicates that at the time of writing (September 1991), it is still too early to comment on the implementation of land reform in Namibia, as it has not yet begun in earnest. Land policy has yet to be detailed and ratified, the institutions for implementing land reform and settlement programmes have to be appointed and in some cases created de novo, and large sums of money have to be found. This paper is therefore addressed, as its title implies, to the process of grappling with the issues of land reform in a largely pastoral setting, in preparation for what is already perceived to be a long and difficult process of implementation. ;"M.

eldis:A32011;‘It is our land’: human rights and land tenure reform in Namaqualand, South Africa;;"Secure access to resources is now recognised in human rights discourse as a universal condition of human well-being. This paper aims to contribute to the theoretical and empirical understanding of land tenure as a human rights issue, by analysing recent land tenure policy in South Africa. Specifically, the paper analyses the implementation of the Transformation of Certain Rural Areas Act (Trancraa) in Namaqualand, Northern Cape Province during 2001 and 2002. 
Trancraa is the first comprehensive post-apartheid land tenure reform in state-claimed, communal lands. It provides for land tenure reform in state-claimed rural areas, formerly ‘coloured reserves’, by returning ownership rights to residents or local institutions through a consultative process. The paper documents the implementation of Trancra in two Rural Areas, Pella and Komaggas. Key findings include: 

    in Pella, the Transformation Committee defended interests in land and development within a pragmatic engagement with civil society and government 
    in Komaggas, the Trancraa process was resisted by a community group that saw the Act as assuming state ownership of land and promoting specific interests 
    claims that ""it is our land"" could reflect both discourses of community tenure and conflicting claims by different groups 
    the state’s offer that ""it is your land"" was shaped by discourses of market-based development and sometimes appeared as ‘an opportunity for the state to bail out’. 

Based on this case study, the paper draws some general conclusions about land tenure as a human rights issue. These include: 

    a social order in which human rights are respected will remove some sources of tenure insecurity, such as racial and gender discrimination 
    rights to information, political participation and non-discrimination are important to enable a fair and effective land reform 
    secure land tenure contributes to the realisation of human rights such as rights to livelihood, work and substantial equality 
    the empirical role of human rights depends on many actors, processes and contextual factors 
    human rights can make collective guarantees about supporting struggles for human capabilities and social transformation, as shown in the Trancraa process.

eldis:A70639;The state of land use management in South Africa;;"In contemporary South Africa, land use management may be considered to be a crucial, but weak link in the transformative project attempted by the overall land management system, and planning activity in general. Land use management is increasingly recognised to have been a neglected area of engagement, and this neglect has had significant consequences.

In this paper, the background section briefly locates land use management within broader land and planning activities. The paper then describes the rationality and nature of the current land use management approach in South Africa. The third section discusses a number of key issues raised when considering LUM from a second economy perspective, and elaborates on the consequences of these issues. These issues have a strong metropolitan bias due to the nature of the source information. The last part of the paper draws out the implications of the discussion when considering interventions in urban areas.

eldis:A27225;Fighting an Uphill Battle: Population Pressure and Declining Land Productivity in Rwanda.;;"Report draws attention to the structure of landholding as a set of mechanisms through which demographic changes in agrarian societies can alter the natural environment: demographically-induced change in the structure of landholding: farm holdings generally become smaller as an ever-increasing number of households enter the agricultural work force and seek to derive their livelihood from this fixed resource base holdings tend to become more fragmented, not simply in the number of parcels operated but in the distances between parcels, as farmers look harder and farther for whatever bits and pieces of land may be availableland scarcity obliges farmers to cultivate marginal, less productive land previously held in pasture, rangeland, woodlot and forestmany households, particularly those owning little land or with an abundance of family labor, find it necessary to expand their holdings by renting land from others.  since little new (virgin) land is brought into cultivation, the length of time under cultivation grows longer for holdings already in operationEmphasis is placed on five important landholding variables of profound importance to farmers in Rwanda: tenure arrangements (ownership versus use rights), size of holdings, geographical dispersion of holdings, fragility (steepness of slope), and years of cultivation. Previous studies and current findings reveal that population pressure in Rwanda has been accompanied by dramatic changes along several of these dimensions of landholding. More than ever before, farmers must rent the land they operate, family land holdings have radically diminished in size, and they see little alternative to farming the steep and fragile slopes that once were held almost exclusively in pasture, woodlot and fallow.How have these changes affected the long-term sustain ability of farming in Rwanda? Traditional inputs such as compost, manure, and mulch, invariably go on fields owned by the farmers and especially on those located nearer to the family compound. The same principle holds for field improvements such as the installation of terraces, hedgerows, grass strips, and drainage ditches rented fields and distant fields are largely ignored. On owner-operated parcels, greater investment in conservation and fertility is seen by farmers as necessary to compensate for the detrimental effects of many more years of cultivation. Without these investments, owner-operated holdings would likely be far more degraded still. In general, the longer a field has been cultivated, the more conservation and fertility investments it will receive. Sure to raise concerns, however, is evidence that after 30 years or so, the level of investment by farmers levels off and begins to decline. Have these fields crossed a threshold in which declining returns to investments become a disincentive to further investment? Do limited resources eventually cause farmers to abandon completely these older holdings? What this means is that farmers are losing a difficult and deeply significant struggle; it means that their prize holdings, those they will pass on to their children, have been worked to the point where, under current circumstances, more investment makes little sense....

eldis:A15293;Impact of carbon value on profitability of improved fallow agroforestry systems in Kigezi highlands, Uganda;;"The economic advantages of improved agro forestry fallow systems over traditional continuous cropping systems are important tools that can be used to influence the choice of land use options at household levels. In Kigezi highlands Uganda, the upper parts of farmers’ crop field terraces are degraded due to continuous cropping. Improved fallows are being promoted in order to increase soil productivity while increasing fuelwood production. Fallows also increase carbon storage in soil and woody biomass.A cost benefit analysis, done to establish the impact of a carbon market on fallow profitability showed that woody biomass carbon would increase farmers’ annual returns by 8, 13 and 26% for the Sesbania, Calliandra and Alnus systems respectively. Soil carbon would increase annual returns by 9, 18 and 40% for the Sesbania, Calliandra and Alnus systems respectively. Without carbon market, Sesbania is more profitable and sustainable; while with carbon markets, Alnus is more attractive. [author] ";"C. Nakakaawa

eldis:A26723;Economic and social components of migration in two regions of Southern Province, Zambia;;"Paper addresses the migration process in the Zambia's Southern Province. Until recently when droughts and cattle diseases have begun to plague the area, Southern Province was known for its ideal farming conditions. Monze district has been home to vast expanses of commercial farming, as well as  smaller ""emergent farms"" and subsistence farmers, all of whom have benefitted  from good soils and climate, and easy access to markets on the line of rail.  The Gwembe Valley, which lies south east and 2000 feet below Monze district,  is also part of Southern Province. However, environmental and geographical  conditions have limited the Gwembe people's ability to feed themselves  consistently, let alone engage in regular cash cropping.  In both places,  migration to frontier farming areas where soils are fertile and rain is  plentiful is one option for improving a person's ability to farm successfully.  This is not to say that migration is a recent phenomenon. As the section on  Zambia's internal migration patterns demonstrates, mobile populations are part  of Zambia's history. However, as populations in a given area grow and soil  fertility declines over time through repeated use, access to suitable farming  lands becomes limited. Migration becomes an outlet for those people lacking  land of sufficient size and fertility.  While the economic incentive to migrate seems apparent, there are many other issues to consider. In this article I raise the issue of social networks in home villages as they relate to resource access. What makes one man migrate and another in the same village remain at home? Through data collected in two different studies, we see the importance of social links and local power relations in determining who has access to which resources, including land and farming implements. The social dynamic between father and son often causes a son to loose access to his father's cattle and plow, with no local alternative for farming his own field. Scrambling for land upon the death of an elder often leaves at least one relative landless. Both of these situations can lead to an individual migrating to a frontier farming area where he has relatives and perhaps better access to farming resources. Following the methodology section introducing the two migration studies on which this article is based, I give a brief history of internal migration in Zambia as background to the current movement patterns found in Southern Province. In discussing migration patterns from the Gwembe Valley and Monze area specifically, I highlight the fluidity of the migration process as well as demographic characteristics of migrant populations. Each region has unique characteristics which influence migrants' decisions. In the section on causes for migration I highlight the social component of many migrants' moves. Problems of drought and poor economy are often the final  straw for a young man who has struggled to gain enough land or cattle to farm in his parents village. This last straw is then simply a kick to force a  decision which has been brewing for years. In the final section I discuss the link between migrants and their relatives at home. Rarely is this link based on altruistic notions of family support and cooperation; instead it is a dynamic relationship negotiated at each end by individuals struggling to have their needs met.

eldis:A39115;Corruption and forest revenues in Papua;;"This paper notes that under a sustainable, well-managed, logging regime, Papua – the most densely forested part of Indonesia – can potentially contribute substantial forest revenues for socio-economic development. Yet, it remains the poorest region in the country, in part due to widespread corruption involving public and private actors.The paper argues that, reforming the management of these resources – specifically, introducing accountability and transparency into the collection of forest revenues – is a key precondition for welfare improvements in the region. The relationship between forest products actually produced and resulting government revenues must be clearly established if the proper financial resources are to be made available for poverty alleviation.The paper makes the following recommendations to the Indonesioan government and to international donors:To Indonesian authorities:

    the government – at national, provincial, and district level – should address corruption in forest revenues through specific changes to the current revenue management system
    the Ministry of Finance should introduce a proper accounting system for the payment of forestry fees and produce an annual financial report that includes a forestry revenue report
    the Supreme Audit Board should verify the adequacy of this forest revenue accounting system and provide an audit opinion on the adequacy of forest revenues
    the Ministry of Finance should become actively involved in the control of wood production via its control of the payment of forestry fees
    law enforcement agencies (particularly the Indonesian Anti-Corruption Commission) should begin active investigations at all levels of the forest revenue management system 

To Donors:

    support the implementation of an Integrated Law Enforcement Approach (ILEA) to the Indonesian forestry sector
    provide capacity building assistance for government agencies involved in implementing ILEA
    provide technology to government agencies and civil society actors involved in monitoring logging activities in remote forest areas
    provide technical assistance to government agencies for producing credible financial and timber production reports

eldis:A26487;The controversy surrounding eucalypts in social forestry programs of Asia;;Social forestry emerged amidst important changes in thinking about the role of  forestry in rural development and a growing need for fuelwood. In an attempt to  alleviate the fuelwood crisis, the World Bank encouraged the planting of  Eucalyptus species in its social forestry programs in the 1980s. Eucalypts were the chosen tree species for the majority of social forestry projects because they survive on difficult sites and out-perform indigenous species and most other exotics in height and girth increment, producing wood for poles, pulp and fuel  more rapidly. But, despite the benefits that eucalypts can bring to developing countries, the introduction of the species in social forestry projects has not been  without controversy.This paper reviews two controversial social forestry projects—one in Karnataka,  South India, and the other in Tung Kula Ronghai, North-east Thailand—based on   Eucalyptus species that resulted in social protest. In doing so, this paper aims to determine why these projects failed to bring benefits to the communities involved  and what it was that caused these communities to protest. In both cases, it was found that criticisms levelled against eucalypts were expressed in ecological  terms. Eucalypts do have some adverse ecological impacts on soil nutrients,  water hydrology, biodiversity and wildlife, but protests against the tree conceal the real reasons for anxieties about the planting of eucalypts—inappropriate use without due consideration for community needs. Both projects resulted in social concerns such as the loss of agricultural land for food production, reductions in rural employment, diversion of forest products from local markets to larger  industrial users, and the transfer of public or common land to private corporations. The failure of eucalypts to meet the social objectives of social forestry policies were found to outweigh any of the technical and ecological criticisms against the tree and Eucalyptus became a symbol and rallying point of grass roots resistance to government meddling, poor project planning and  management. Lessons to be learned from the failings of the Karnataka and Tung Kula Ronghai social forestry projects will be drawn and couched within the     framework of ecologically sustainable development. Whilst both projects caused unnecessary hardship to those communities involved, much can be learnt from the failings of these projects and these lessons will minimise the risks of similar controversies arising in future social forestry projects ;A.

This new volume reflects a decade of intensive work on the continent by LTC and a very considerable deepening of knowledge and understanding of land tenure issues in Africa. It addresses events of the past ten years, which have been substantial in many of the countries covered. Land tenure continues to be a volatile policy domain. The standard topics from the earlier profiles have been revised to take into account new development concerns. The following are examples of topics covered: national land policy and legal framework, replacement and adaptation of indigenous tenure systems, tenure constraints and opportunities, economic growth and food security strategies, agricultural development, natural resource management and conservation, democratization and governance, gender dimensions, present policy position and reform debates, and implications for policy reform and programming.

eldis:A27569;Peasant Logic, Agrarian Policy, Land Mobility, and Land Markets in Mexico;;Mexican rural reform has questioned the role of the peasantry and private national producers in agriculture. The reform followed a neoliberal paradigm for incorporating the nation into the global village. As part of a government strategy, land reform in Mexico aims to change entrepreneurial and land tenure patterns in rural areas into an individual, private, large-scale, and capitalist productive structure, and the land market is vital in allowing the land transfers needed to change the land tenure pattern. Alternative land reforms favor a smallholding structure, and many academics, peasant and indigenous organizations, and even government officials, now favor structural changes that are related to the factors of production in rural Mexico and to the historical construction of the nation. This paper argues that the land market should have a vital role in an agrarian reform that favors the peasantry and indigenous people. There is a need to understand the peasants and indigenous people's logic, rationality and subjective construction of land, for land is the foundation of their survival strategies. The land market can answer to values that have deep cultural roots. The modernization of rural Mexico could be more inclusive, and the land reform strategy could be designed from the bottom to the top and consider the diversity of the rural communities.[author] ;"R.D.

eldis:A27485;Making Negotiated Land Reform Work: Initial Experience from Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa;;"Can land reform have a lasting impact on poverty reduction? The paper describes and evaluates a new type of negotiated land redistribution and highlights key areas that merit attention in designing programs of this nature.Deininger describes a new type of negotiated land reform that relies on voluntary land transfers negotiated between buyers and sellers, with the government's role restricted to establishing the necessary framework for negotiation and making a land purchase grant available to eligible beneficiaries.This approach has emerged—following the end of the Cold War and broad macroeconomic adjustment—as many countries face a second generation of reforms to address deep-rooted structural problems and provide a basis for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. Deininger describes initial experiences in Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa. It is too soon to know whether negotiated land reform can rise to the challenges administrative land reform failed to solve but the data so far suggest that: Negotiated land reform can succeed only if measures are taken to make the market for land sales and rental more fluid and transparent.  Productive projects are likely to be the key to market-assisted land reform. The potential for project productivity establishes an upper bound on the price to be paid and a basis for financial intermediaries to evaluate the project. It also requires beneficiaries to familiarize hemselves with the realities they're likely to confront as independent farmers and the limits to how much land reform can help them achieve their goals. The only way to effectively coordinate the entities involved in the process is through decentralized, demand-driven implementation.   The long-run success of land reform depends on getting the private sector involved and using the land purchase grant to ""crowd in"" private money.  ";K.

Agricultural productivity and profitability is declining and, despite continuous increases of government subsidy, paddy plantations are decreasing. Adaption practices are found to be ineffective. Policy recommendations include greater cooperation by stakeholders with farmers to solve water issues, improve communication (including weather forecasts), and adapt farm management practices.

eldis:A32383;The new broker: beyond agreement;;"This document discusses the challenges and dilemmas in multi-stakeholder partnering work, particularly the development and use of metrics to measure progress. It is aimed particularly at partner organisations, and individuals hired to aid in the facilitation, monitoring or management of partnerships as independent, ‘external’, third-parties.
Through a fictitious dialogue, it highlights the need for sensitively tracking and evaluating the performance of partnerships in which individuals are engaged. With an intentional focus on the oil and gas sector, this work is an alternative source of information on partnership brokering, providing a contrast to the growing number of more serious guides, manuals and academic journal articles on the subject. The tools and principles presented in this book are, however, transferable to other businesses and development sectors.

eldis:A38367;The Great Green Wall initiative for the Sahara and the Sahel;;"Desertification has had an acute impact in Africa, particularly in the Community of the Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD), which is characterised by climate ranging from hyper-arid to dry sub-humid. The local communities and their livelihoods are heavily dependent on the increasingly fragile natural resources. This note, conducted by the Sahara and Sahel Observatory (OSS) on the request from CEN-SAD, summarises the results obtained from available documentation and consultations from experts and practitioners for the preparation and implementation of the Great Green Wall in the region. The document emphasises that the Great Green Wall initiative has not been conceived as a wall made up of trees planted across the Sahara, but rather as a set of cross-sectoral actions and interventions aimed at the conservation and protection of natural resources with a view to achieving development and, particularly, alleviating poverty. The report draws lessons learnt from past experiences while considering current development needs.Key objectives of the Great Green Wall initiative include:

    reforestation and recovery of existing vegetation focusing on plant species, plant production and planting techniques, 
    curbing illegal logging
    promotion of modern bioenergy instead of unsustainable biomass use
    improvement in water resources management, which includes investment in appropriate irrigation 
    production of green energy and food crops
    active participation of local communities, among others.

eldis:A17393;Reasons for food insecurity of farm households in South Wollo, Ethiopia: explanations at grassroots;;"This paper takes a grassroots approach to understand the causes of the variation in food security status among rural farm households Ethiopia.The research is carried out by the Broadening Access and Strengthening Input Market Systems (BASIS) project in Ethiopia which conducted a panel of household surveys since June 2000 in four study districts in South Wollo and Oromia zones of Amhara region. The surveys collected data on different aspects of household livelihood, including household demography, food stock and food consumption, assets, land tenure and transaction, farm production, off-farm activities, and institutions and institutional services.The author describes the socioeconomic contexts and the food security status of rural households, and uses the case studies of key informants to discuss the explanations of food security and insecurity.The author concludes that cultural values and norms and existing institutions need to be assessed and understood in designing any food insecurity and poverty reduction strategy and policy. In order to break the vicious poverty and food insecurity trap and induce rural and agricultural transformation, changes are required in: some social values/norms; incentives; market and credit services; research and extension services; cooperative/group works, and; the nature and operation of property (land) institutions (rules) and public agencies/organisations.The main findings include:improving land access through the market and credit supply may play an important role in alleviating the asset constraintsmotivation and work discipline are important personal psychological behaviour that may contribute to achieving food security goalsculturally embodied traditional values and attitudes to work, time management, capital accumulation and profit are relevant factors that affect livelihood activities and managementfood secure farm households are engaged substantially in non-staple cash enterprises like livestock rearing, cash crops, and trading, implying that diversification, based on local resources and market opportunities, is an essential component of food security.

eldis:A75229;CARP institutional assessment in a Post-2008 transition scenario: implications for Land Administration and Management (LAM) ;;"The objective of this paper is to present the land administration and management (LAM) issues on CARP and determine the necessary institutional reforms on LAM in view of CARP expiration in 2008. The paper discussed the adverse effects brought about by weak land policy and poor land administration on attaining the objectives of CARP. The poor land records, the lack of information sharing among government land agencies, the tedious land titling and registration process, the unclear land policies have resulted not only in prolonged implementation of the program but also flawed land redistribution and incomplete transfers of property rights. These outcomes evolved second-generation issues as “unperfected” titles are traded despite the restrictions imposed by the land reform law. The current LAM in the country showed that the system cannot handle the land transactions that evolve and continue to evolve from hundreds and thousands of transactions involving CARP-awarded lands. There is a need to restore not only the confidence on Torrens system of titling on agriculture lands but also to restore the functioning of the rural land market. This is a key challenge on LAM since it would require reconciling information from key land agencies and including that of the LandBank. It will also require legislative actions on land market regulations, land use policy, and land administration in the country.

eldis:A37844;Gender and natural resource management: livelihoods, mobility and interventions;;"This book examines the gender dimensions of natural resource exploitation and management, with a focus on Asia. It explores the uneasy negotiations between theory, policy, and practice that are often evident within the realm of gender, environment, and natural resource management. It offers a critical feminist perspective on gender relations and natural resource management in the context of contemporary policy concerns: decentralized governance, the elimination of poverty, and the mainstreaming of gender.The book is centred around three themes:

    the changing global context with which approaches to gender and environment must engage, particularly changes associated with neo-liberalism
    the ways 'gender' has been incorporated in environment and development practices, especially within interventions designed to accomplish sustainable development goals
    the realm of gender, knowledge and authority, and how gendered subjectivities problematise simplistic mappings of gendered agency and environmental actions.

The book combines conceptual argument with empirical material from a variety of political, economic and ecological contexts across Asia, including Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. In different ways, the authors explore how gender subjectivities, ideologies and identities are produced, employed and contested within natural resource governance, and how gender discourses shape exclusions and possibilities within environment/development processes. The book is intended as a core resource for students of gender studies and natural resource management, and as supplementary reading for a wide range of disciplines including geography, environmental studies, sociology, and development. It also provides a stimulating collection of ideas for professionals looking to incorporate gender issues within their practice in sustainable development. ";"B., P. Resurreccion

eldis:A75458;Farmland utilization and improvements for agricultural production infrastructure: farmland consolidation;;"Farmland consolidation is the act of consolidating a series of fragmented and irregular farmland plots to enlarge plot their size and support sufficient irrigation. Farmland consolidation also combines and groups the proprietor’s farmland into one area by administrative give-and-take as well as division-and-junction of their land. Moreover, it also includes the rearrangement of farmland, which is small or lacks sufficient infrastructure due to farmland consolidation or earthwork waterways projects that were done in the past. Such areas can be reconsolidated into a larger scale production by employing farm machinery.

This study is intended not only to investigate the process, achievement, and outcomes of the Farmland Consolidation Project, which has been constantly implemented since the late
1960’s, but also to draw out the implications of these findings.

eldis:A72567;Past, present and future: fifty years of anthropology in Sudan;;"This book is about the history of anthropology in Sudan. Contributors to the book represent different generations of anthropologists who at some point in time either taught at the department in Khartoum or had some sort of connection to it. They also represent different countries: Sudan, Norway, United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and France. Some contributors taught at the department during the 1960s and 1970s, and they represent different traditions of anthropology. British, American and Norwegian anthropologists were part of the department staff during the early days and brought different experiences and traditions of anthropology to Sudan. Their involvement in both teaching and research directed the orientation of the discipline in Sudan and influenced Sudanese anthropologists. The chapters in this book therefore illustrate the diversity and dynamism of anthropology in Sudan and also show how the discipline developed in relation to the specificities of a developing country like Sudan. Through teaching and research, foreign and Sudanese anthropologists contributed to development efforts in Sudan to the extent that the topics with which they engage are relevant to local development needs. Sudan anthropology has been important for world anthropology. The seminal contributions of E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Fredrik Barth, Ian Cunnison, and Talal Asad remain  classics in anthropology. The department also occupies a prestigious position in the region: it played important roles in establishing an anthropology department in Ethiopia, and teaching anthropology in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

eldis:A74490;Land, labour and migrations: understanding Kerala's economic modernity ;;"This paper seeks to map out the historical trajectory leading to a series of migrations in and from the erstwhile princely state of Travancore during 1900-70 in order to acquire and bring land under cultivation. It argues that these migrations undertaken with a moralistic and paternal mission of reclaiming ‘empty’ spaces into productive locations were a result of a specific form of economic modernity in Kerala as beckoned by colonialism and appropriated by a resolute local agency through a process of translation.

The attempt is to disentangle the intertwining history of colonialism, capital and ‘native’ agency and thereby to capture the complex circumstances that unleashed a new discourse of development with land and hard work at the centre of its scheme. The transition was facilitated by a conforming social imaginary that not only dissented radically with the idea of leaving landscape empty and being idle but also advocated passionately the idea of using the opulent natural resources for the development of the self and the nation. Leading the transition the Syrian Christians were successful in wielding a new subjectivity of development with a specific authority over the modernity of Kerala as purogamana karshakar (forward-looking peasants).

eldis:A13899;The impact of HIV/AIDS on rural households and land issues in Southern and Eastern Africa.;;This paper develops a conceptual framework to holistically explore the impact of HIV/AIDS on land, particularly at the rural household level.  It is intended that this framework will provide a basis for pragmatic recommendations on this issue, which the paper argues is a neglected area in all Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) countries.A broad review of the impacts of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic impacts and impacts on household livelihood strategies, provides the basis for the conceptual framework.  The conceptual framework outlines that:Firstly, it is important to identify the phases of HIV/AIDS: asymptomatic, early illness, chronic illness, critical illness, death and survivors, as each phase is associated with different impacts and therefore different implications for land issues. The latter category, survivors is particularly important to emphasise, since there are many more affected than infected people.Secondly, prolonged illness and early death alter social relations, which include institutions governing access to and inheritance of land.  This affects both access and utilisation of households and individuals on the one hand, and land planning and administration on the other. Analysis of change needs to recognise a range of social attributes affecting the dynamics of land relations, including:cultural, legal, political and other social dimensions affecting entitlementhow HIV/AIDS affects land entitlement and vice versawhether lack of entitlement to land increases vulnerability to HIV/AIDShow HIV/AIDS impacts on institutions involved in land administrationthe inputs needed to secure effective use of land by HIV/AIDS affected householdsthe fact that entitlement is not static and changes across gender and agethe complex continuum from landed to landlessthe fact that although access to land may not be the most effective strategy for HIV/AIDS affected households, in rural areas it is likely to remain central to their survivalThirdly, it is useful to differentiate these issues into three main areas of land use, land rights and land administration.  The impact on these areas is most usefully conceptualised through the lens of the household:HIV/AIDS affected households generally have less access to labour, less capital to invest in agriculture and are less productive.  Therefore land use is important as a result of the epidemic’s impact on mortality, morbidity and the resultant loss of skills, knowledge, and diversion of scarce resourcesThe focus on land rights considers the extent of impact on the terms and conditions in which individuals and households hold, use and transact land. This affects in particular the rights of women and children in the context of rural power relations.  A number of other issues in relation to HIV/AIDS and land tenure are important especially in localities experiencing increasing land pressure, land scarcity, commercialisation of agriculture, increased investment, and intensifying competition and conflicts over landThe impacts on land administration is a related issue and is a result of the epidemic affecting people involved in the institutions that are directly and indirectly involved in the administration of land. These include local level of community institutions such as traditional authorities, civil society, various levels of government and the private sector[adapted from the author] ;S.

eldis:A101638;In search of the solution to farmer–pastoralist conflicts in Tanzania ;;Land-use conflict is not a new phenomenon for pastoralists and farmers in Tanzania with murders, the killing of livestock and the loss of property as a consequence of this conflict featuring in the news for many years now. Various actors, including civil society organisations, have tried to address farmer-pastoralist conflict through mass education programmes, land-use planning, policy reforms and the development of community institutions. However, these efforts have not succeeded in the conflict. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa traditional systems are not making much headway either. This paper finds that resolving the mutual hostility between farmers and pastoralists is problematic because it is linked to historical evictions that happened from the colonial and post-colonial period until the early 1990s. It also points to the limitations of Tanzania’s formal land dispute settlement machinery, which does not provide appropriate forums and mechanisms for resolving farmer-pastoralist conflicts. The paper argues that the existing systems do not favour the interests of either farmers or pastoralists, and calls for specific reforms. Drawing on the experiences of a farmer-pastoralist platform established by the Tanzania Natural Resource Forum, a local non-governmental organisation working on natural resource governance issues, it proposes an alternative mechanism based on the popular participation of the victims in resolving such conflicts. ;G.E.

eldis:A28959;Notions of rights over land and the history of Mongolian pastoralism;;This article explores the history of notions of land ownership among Mongolian pastoralists in a historical context.In the 1990s the Mongolian state implemented a series of reforms designed to create a competitive market economy based on private property. These included the wholesale privatisation of the pastoral economy and the dissolution of the collective and state farms. The Asian Development Bank and other international development agencies advocated new legislation to allow the private ownership of land. This remains a highly controversial issue in Mongolia, particularly with respect to pasture land which remains a public-access resource.This paper reviews the history of conflicting notions of rights over land, and explores the ways in which indigenous concepts are rooted in pastoral practices and institutions which have long histories on the Mongolian steppe. Historically, mobile systems of pastoral land-use in Inner Asia were based upon the flexible use of pastures by pastoralists within an established framework of use-rights, but this access was very clearly subject to regulation by district authorities.This historical context explains the fierce resistance the Mongolian government has encountered in trying to introduce legislation that would permit the private ownership of land so as to bring Mongolia into line with international economic orthodoxy. These economic orthodoxies are being introduced by agents of neo-liberal policies such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB). [author] ;D.

eldis:A67816;Topic Guide: Land;;"Written by ODI's Anna Locke and Giles Henley, the guide provides a summary of the latest thinking around contemporary global land issues in developing countries. It also gives guidance on and evidence for how this thinking can be used in practice; provides signposting to reliable sources that can inform development professionals on issues not covered in the Topic Guide; and highlights where there are gaps in knowledge and evidence.

The Topic Guide begins by addressing key issues around large-scale land acquisition in developing countries (including the evidence for the impact of land acquisition) before moving on to discuss reactions to rising interest in land at national and international levels. This includes an analysis of key international and regional initiatives such as the FAO Voluntary Guidelines and the G8 Land Transparency Initiative. The third section addresses land reform and policy - identifying types, impacts and risks. This includes a brief history of donor engagement in the land sector, as well as a discussion of the debate around the role of land titling. The final section looks at land issues in fragile and conflict-affected states.

The Guide includes three detailed case studies: firstly, a case study on the Rwanda Land Tenure Regularisation Programme; secondly, Land Policy Development in Mozambique; and thirdly, a case study on Land Issues in Burma.

eldis:A25206;Current issues in cattle pricing and marketing in Botswana;;Botswana's meat export parastatal, the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC), has been much in the local news. Cattle suppliers have become accustomed to substantial annual producer price increases from this successful national industry, which has expanded increasingly into European markets. But at the end of 1984 it was announced that there would be no bonus paid and no price increase for 1985. This was later changed to a small 5% price increase, following producer pressure. Then followed allegations of managerial extravagance and corruption, voiced in the National Assembly, and the sudden retirement of the executive chairman.These notes look at some of the principal issues in cattle pricing and marketing in Botswana which underlie the present concern  namely the recent performance of BMC, the proposed Francistown abattoir, the impact of the growing domestic beef market and the organization of cattle supplies to BMC. The conclusion reached is that cattle pricing is likely to be an increasingly controversial issue in the near future as BMC struggles with the two opposing goals of capacity expansion and cost reduction, and government struggles with the equally conflicting goals of retaining high producer prices while putting the cattle industry onto an increasingly cost covering basis. ;"M.

eldis:A67812;Climate change and natural resources conflicts in Africa;;"Africa is among the most likely vulnerable regions of the world that are to be negatively impacted by climate change. The continent’s vulnerability to climate change arises from a combination of many factors, including extreme poverty, high rate of population increase, frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods, and agricultural systems that are heavily dependent on rainfall. Under-development in some African states has also been a function of existing protracted natural resource conflicts and climate change worsens the situation. Climate change is a major threat to livelihood security in Africa.

This monograph encompasses papers from different disciplines and draws case studies from across Africa. It covers a range of issues relating to vulnerabilities, adaptation and mitigation of climate change and conflict management. Information provided in this monograph is expected to form the basis for decision makers across Africa to formulate and implement appropriate policies to curb the impacts of climate change.

eldis:A63009;Enhancing resilience in the Horn of Africa: an exploration into alternative investment options;;"This discussion paper seeks to explore alternative investment options with the aim of enhancing resilience in the Horn of Africa. Climate change, conflict, drought and increasing populations are leading many to pessimistic conclusions regarding the future viability of pastoral farming, arguing that these livelihoods should be sedentarised and diversified. Simultaneously, others argue for their wholesale protection. This paper argues that both economic theory and the existing evidence base points to the need for a balanced development strategy involving both inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral development, as well as cross-cutting transformations of the demographic, social and political structure of the arid and semiarid lowlands (ASAL). After providing a contextual understanding of livelihoods in the region, the paper discusses economic transformation as a guiding principle. It then describes the scope for both non-livestock and livestock development strategies in the ASAL regions. Despite the concerns, pastoral farming is actually an efficient and resilient adaptation strategy to the environment when compared to non-irrigated non-pastoral farming. Increasing demand and livestock prices also offer reasons to modernise and support pastoral farming as part of a balanced investment strategy.There are key knowledge gaps that must be addressed before the question of how to balance investments can be resolved:

    the stresses on the carrying capacity of the environment and the interrelated resilience to shocks associated with varying of different human and livestock populations;
    the feasibility and potential of irrigation projects;
    the cost-effectiveness and time frame of interventions in each agricultural sector, as well as in cross-cutting interventions in education, social policy, microfinance, development etc.; and 
    the potential for regional and inter-regional migration and non-farm diversification.

A number of innovative service delivery mechanisms are suggested, including:

    the diverse and extensive uses that mobile telephones offer, e.g. in trade, microfinance and health;
    mobile and long-distance learning, and boarding schools;
    improved early warning systems (another potential use of mobile phones);
    weather-based index insurance; and
    improved infrastructure and access to relevant services linked to output markets via livestock development clusters.

Priority was given to review of articles that had been recommended by an expert, were empirical studies linking tenure to forest outcomes, expanded the geographic coverage, and/or were frequently cited. Particular attention was given to articles describing previous attempts to assess the evidence that enhanced community management rights are associated with better forest outcomes.

eldis:A8477;Slash and burn – are shifting cultivators harming forests?;;Everyone agrees that logging and agriculture can cause deforestation. But does shifting cultivation, or ‘slash and burn’ farming destroy forests particularly? Are local farmers solely to blame? Recent research by Overseas Development Institute (ODI) suggests the role of shifting farming in starting forest fires has been exaggerated. It is not, in fact, a major cause of biodiversity loss. The report finds that the causes of deforestation are many and varied, and that governments and international investors are also responsible. ;"David Brown

eldis:A26548;Rethinking Policy Options for Watershed Management by Local Communities: Combining Equity, Efficiency and Ecological-Economic Viability;;Argues for certain basic re-thinking in the policy options for viable watershed management by combining local knowledge with the formal science through rejuvenated or revitalized traditional institutions. Part one reviews the policy environment in the light of some of the recent reports in India which have a major bearing on watershed development programs. Argues that natural scientists have committed a fundamental error when they assumed that major challenge in watershed management was transfer of technology instead of development of technology on people's lands and in their neighborhoods. Given the ecological heterogeneity evident to soil scientists and people working in these regions, there was no way standard solutions could have been replicated over large areas. The need for action research in generating viable options through collaborative thinking is necessary. Various other weaknesses of the existing programs are identified in this section. In part two, discusses the theory of portfolio options which can provide an effective alternative to the current approaches to watershed management. Also suggests that people's knowledge about biodiversity, historical land-use and various conservation measures needs to be supplemented with modern science and technology in an experimental manner so that limits of both the knowledge system - formal and informal- become opportunities for innovation rather than constraints. In part three, discusses various policy changes in research, public administration, decentralized system of self governance, and interface with voluntary organizations and people's institutions.  Concludes that large scale efforts in restoration of productivity of eroded regions have to be appreciated without ignoring the fact that spreading resources thinly may give political advantage but would not generate any durable change in the resource management situation.

eldis:A73901;Legitimate land tenure and property rights: fostering compliance and development outcomes Rapid Evidence Assessment;;"Growing populations and economic change resulting from globalisation and climate change are increasing pressure on land, particularly in urbanising countries. This exposes many of those occupying and using land, particularly the poor and women, to risks resulting from tenure insecurity. Customary practices in land management are giving way to market-based statutory systems of land tenure. This development has been accompanied by a significant increase in demand for land for investment; in some countries this has caused land users to lose rights and access to their land and other natural resources. Altogether, these trends have presented governments with significant challenges to effectively govern land tenure and property rights in a way that is socially acceptable and legitimate, and at the same time delivers inclusive economic development.

This rapid evidence assessment (REA) seeks to address the question of which policies and interventions or approaches have been successful in fostering compliance with legitimate land tenure rights and what impact these strategies have had on development outcomes.

The research reviewed for this paper shows that there is evidence that a range of strategies employed by government, civil society and local communities have improved tenure security and property rights. There is also some evidence that these strategies have resulted in some immediate or short-term outcomes, i.e. improved living conditions for vulnerable groups such as women. However, there is limited and mixed evidence that strategies have had an impact on development outcomes. Many of the examples that were found to have fostered compliance have not been in place long enough for evidence of positive outcomes on poverty reduction, gender equity, and access to formal credit, or public services to emerge and manifest themselves.

eldis:A38622;Coping with riverbank erosion induced displacement;;"Each year, tens of thousands of people in Bangladesh are internally displaced as a consequence of riverbank erosion. Yet, such erosion does not draw the attention of policy makers in the same way that other natural disasters do and as a result, a number of coping mechanisms are employed by those affected, with the burden of displacement largely falling on women. This brief argues that instead of attempting to alter the course of nature, it is time to address the institutional mechanisms needed to help affected people cope with displacement and their material and social loss. Policy and programme recommendations include: 

    the government of Bangladesh should include riverbank erosion in its five year plan and in its framing of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
    it should also develop a national habitat policy that would ensure the shelter needs of the tens of thousands of people displaced each year 
    local government organisations should play the lead role in all phases – decentralisation of power and increased responsibility and accountability to local government bodies is an important aspect to reduce vulnerability and provide a quicker and more efficient response 
    efforts should be made to coordinate all aid and development interventions 

It is asserted that programmes should be developed to cater to the needs of those affected. In addition, increased emphasis should also be placed on promoting a rights-based approach which encourages affected people to demand access to education, health care, water, sanitation and work opportunities as a matter of right, rather than charity from the state. A number of recommendations are given to this end. The authors argue that, crucially, those affected need to be viewed as agents rather than simply subjects of rehabilitation programmes, asserting that only by constant promotion of their rights can their interests be protected.

This paper evaluates several important international governance initiatives in the African oil sector, including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Publish What You Pay, Transparency International and Global Witness.  What are the lessons we can learn from their successes and failures? Is there really a resource curse? Why does it hit some countries harder than others? Case studies of eight African oil-rent-dependent states (Angola, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria and Sudan) are tabulated for comparative analysis. These are followed by several two variable correlations of oil-rent dependency (independent variable), which analyse poverty, corruption, governance and violence (dependent variables). In conclusion, various moral lessons are drawn concerning the present-day realities of the oil-governance initiatives.

eldis:A67363;Forest governance in Africa;;"Although difficult to calculate systematically, forests play a significant economic role at the continental, regional, national and local levels in Africa. This paper sets out to provide an overview of key forest governance issues across the African continent. It focuses particularly on the experiences in western, central and, to a lesser extent, eastern subregions of the continent. Particular emphasis is given to the divergence between the forest as a provider of means to rural people and governance mechanisms that have predominantly focused on national economic activities and political priorities. 

The paper considers where the forests are, the main differences among them, their main uses and value to African people, and the main changes in their extent and condition. It summarises some of the key features and issues concerning African forest ownership and user rights. It considers issues and challenges around the state of knowledge of the continent’s forests, describing several ‘forest paradigms’ that have played an important role in setting the current, or emerging, context for forest governance. The role of some of the key stakeholders in forest governance systems is considered, firstly addressing the ‘problem’ of local stakeholders, and then providing several short case studies of how political intervention by senior decision makers, or outright corruption and graft, have both undermined proper governance and marginalised other stakeholders. Recent trends in the development of forest policies and legal frameworks are described, and the key issue of the decentralisation of forest governance is discussed.

eldis:A14671;Resource curse or not: a question of appropriability;;This paper explores the impact of natural resources on development. It uses new data on natural resources to show that, contrary to the popular ‘resource curse’ hypothesis, resource abundance in itself is not negative for a country’s economy. It argues that whether natural resources are good or bad for a country’s development depends crucially on the interaction between institutional setting and the type of resources that the country possesses.Findings include:some natural resources are for economical and technical reasons more likely to cause problems such as rent-seeking and conflicts than others: these are ‘technically appropriable’ resourcesthis potential problem can be countered by good institutional quality, which renders theses resources less ‘institutionally appropriable’mineral rich countries are cursed only if they have low quality institutions, while the curse is reversed if institutions are good enoughthis trend is even more stark for countries rich in diamonds and precious metalsas resources become less technically appropriable, the relative importance of institutions is predicted to be less decisive.[adapted from author] ;"A.D.

eldis:A67494;Natural resource governance, boom and bust: the case of Kolwezi in the DRC;;"Mineral extraction is the main source of employment and income in, Kolwezi, a city that has been tied since its inception to the
fortunes of Congolese copper and cobalt mining and the intertwined narrative of trends in international copper and cobalt supply, demand and price.

This paper considers the effects of the successive booms and busts in the mining industry and the commodity markets on the management of natural resources in Kolwezi. It focuses on the commodities boom that ran from 2004–2008, and the bust that began in 2008, which appears, at the time of writing, early 2009, to be far from its conclusion. Field research conducted in November 2008 revealed that the booms and busts of commodity markets and the mining industry have presented not only severe challenges for natural resource governance in Kolwezi, but opportunities for reform. Yet, as has been well documented, the modern Congolese state exhibits weak capacity to manage any aspects of the country’s mineral wealth. It remains dangerously ill-equipped to respond to either the opportunities or the challenges.

eldis:A28283;Access to land and land policy reforms;;The objective of the research that this policy brief reports on is to analyse different mechanisms of access to land for the rural poor in an era when redistribution through expropriative land reform is largely inconsistent with the forces of political economy. The roads of access to land which are explored are intra-family transfers, access through community membership, land sales and rental markets, and government programmes including decollectivisation and land-market assisted land reform. The array of instruments is vast, and each can be subsidised to specific policy interventions to make them more effective for sustainable poverty reduction.The paper argues that under conditions of relative land abundance and/or in communities with strong social capital that helps establish a working informal order based on community trust-enforcement mechanisms, land markets can work efficiently and be progressive without formal definition of property rights and without formal registration of transfers. When these conditions do not hold, formalising the legal definition of property rights and introducing the modern institutions necessary to make land markets work both efficiently and equitably becomes essential. Two measures for this purpose are identified. Measures that need to be introduced specifically to make land sales and land rental markets work are also identified.Conclusions:there are many alternative paths of access to land, some totally informal and others rigidly formalised, some spontaneous and others relying on extensive government intervention. The efficiency of these paths are specific to the context and to the types of rural household concernedto be effective, land policy reforms need to be embedded in comprehensive policy and institutional reforms, and complemented by effective rural development interventions in support of the competitiveness of beneficiaries[Author] ;"A.

eldis:A25386;Rural poverty in Ecuador : a qualitative assessment;;This report aims to assess what poverty means to marginalized rural families, what kind of survival strategies families use in times of hardship, and what these families believe is needed to alleviate their poverty. The rural families express very practical solutions to overcoming poverty, largely linked to increasing the productivity of human resources and land through training and smallscale infrastructure investments.A complement to recent indepth quantitative analyses of rural poverty in Ecuador, this is a report on the results of the Rural Qualitative Assessment of living conditions in rural communities in all three of Ecuador's diverse regions.Using a variety of qualitative techniques, the research aimed to assess what poverty means to marginalized rural families, what kind of survival strategies families use in times of hardship, and what these families believe is needed to alleviate poverty. Several key messages emerge:Rural communities with the same characteristics (such as area, soil quality, and ethnic background) are actually very heterogeneous in their command of land resources, definition of well-being, range of economic activities, and recommendations for what is needed to overcome poverty. In times of hardship, families have complemented income from traditional sources (such as subsistence agriculture and small animal husbandry) with earnings from new activities. In addition to migration, which plays a pivotal role in all communities, piecework and weaving are important to income generation in the Sierra, small businesses are important in the Costa, and increased production of cash crops is important in the Orient. Families have also reduced expenditures on clothing, fiestas, and food. Spending less on food is alarming as malnutrition rates in rural Ecuador are already very high. Poor rural families express very practical solutions to overcoming poverty. They don't demand sweeping changes, such as expropriation of land from large farmers. Overwhelmingly, they suggest measures that will make available land and human resources more productive. Almost half the suggestions from poor rural families have to do with infrastructure. Many families also want training courses (both agricultural and nonagricultural).This paper --- a product of the Country Operations Division 1, Latin America and the Caribbean, Country Department III --- is part of a larger effort in the department to combine qualitative and quantitative analysis into economic and sector work.

eldis:A38560;Al Hima: a way of life;;"The Hima is a traditional system of resource tenure that has been practiced for more than 1400 years in the Arabian Peninsular. With the numerous deteriorations that came and halted advancement in the Arab world, and at times for different reasons, the Hima also declined. The progressive concepts of the Hima became hav been masked by the general regression suffered in the region and the recent advances accomplished by other countries, civilizations and people. This digital book brings back recognition for the positive contributions that traditional knowledge and ingenious approaches of this region had brought and can still give to development and conservation. The book presents these traditional approaches as a tool that existed and can still exist to advance the conservation and poverty paradigms and to meet upcoming challenges related to conflicts and climate change, as the concept of Hima emphasises is closely linked to resilience. The authors outline how the most successful revival attempts to date have taken place in Lebanon where the Hima efforts aim to complement conservation efforts not to replace them. Various other regional advances are discussed in countries including Iran and Indonesia. 
The authors highlight that to be Hima, a protected area should:

    be constituted by a legitimate authoritative body
    be established in the Way of God, for purposes pertaining to public welfare
    not cause undue hardship to local people and not deprive them of resources that are indispensable to their subsistence
    realise greater actual benefits to society than detriments

eldis:A37581;Fuelling exclusion? The biofuels boom and poor people's access to land;;"The policy debate about the merits and demerits of biofuels is growing and changing rapidly, with concerns being voiced over their effectiveness for mitigating climate change, role in recent food price hikes and social environmental impacts. This study contributes to these debates through examining the current and likely future impacts of the increasing spread of biofuels on access to land in producer countries, particularly for poorer rural people. It draws on a literature review of evidence drawn from diverse contexts across Africa, Asia and Latin America. It also uses intelligence and information provided by key informants by email or telephone. The study concludes that, while biofuels can be instrumental in revitalising land use and livelihoods in rural areas, these possibilities depend on security of land tenure. Where competing resource claims exist among local resource users, governments and incoming biofuel producers, and where appropriate conditions are not in place, it finds that the rapid spread of commercial biofuel production may result - and is resulting - in poorer groups losing access to the land on which they depend. The paper also documents a number of promising approaches, for example those where smallholders have been able to use and even consolidate their land access through seizing the opportunities offered by biofuel feedstock cultivation, whether for income generation or for local energy self-sufficiency. It argues that sharing these “successful” experiences can help build and disseminate better practice. Based on the findings, a number of pointers are given for policy and practice by governments and the private sector at local, national and international levels. These include:

    governments must develop robust safeguards in procedures to allocate land to large-scale biofuel feedstock production where these are lacking, including local consultation and attainment of prior informed consent, mechanisms for appeal and arbitration, and periodic review
    large-scale privately owned plantations are not the only economically viable model for biofuels feedstock production. Producers’ associations, governments and investors may want to explore alternative business models such as joint equity in production and processing
    clearer definitions of concepts of idle, under-utilised, barren, unproductive, degraded, abandoned and marginal lands (depending on the country context) are required to avoid allocation of lands on which local user groups depend for livelihoods
    certification criteria should incorporate free prior and informed consent, based on secure land tenure of local residents, as a fundamental requirement, disallowing production on contested land
    local, national and international NGOs and civil society organisations have a continued role to play in holding governments and industry to account regarding their promises on protection of land access and food security to specific communities and more generally.

eldis:A26339;Land rights under pressure: access to resources in southern Benin;;"Analyses the range of institutional arrangements being used for gaining access to land and natural resources in two regions of southern Benin. The land tenure systems examined are grouped into two types:Those dependant upon classic ""communal"" regimes where land tenure is determined primarily by lineage and disputes are settled by village and family elders or chiefsThose which depend on a system of landlords and tenants with its roots in the decline of the slave trade.Having outlined these systems and highlighted the various processes which influence land tenure - such as pressure on land, diverse use, public policy and the growing importance of oil palm - the report gives a detailed account of differing types of land rights. These fall into 4 categories:The right to cultivate food cropsThe right to harvest woodThe right to extract palm wineThe right to harvest palm nutsDifferent institutional arrangements can be seen as combining these rights to differing degrees and these are in turn examined to determine how and where they are applied, the extent of tenants rights and the length and cost of contracts. Types of arrangement were listed as:Zunda - fixed period tenant farming contract. Originally on fallow land but know extended to all land due to scarcityLema - principle form of sharecropping contract with several variantsAwoba - uses land as guarantee as part of a loan agreementPalm grove contracts -  contract whereby a purchaser buys rights to manage a plantation whilst sharing access with a food producer growing crops on the same land.Guardian contracts - relationship linking former slaves to their former masters based strongly on family lineage.Lending land - loans within close or extended family or outside of the family groupAmong the author's findings were:The systems and contracts used were found to ""broaden the range of beneficiaries with access to land and other resources"" and to play an important role in resolving issues relating to markets for labour and farm produce.Limited soil fertility tended to favour arrangements where tenants received a higher proportion of the crop yield hence productivity was greater under zunda rather than lema systems.Customary regimes, as a result of dependence on lineage, often forced women and younger men into the land rental market as a result of there not being enough land to divide amongst families.Documentation of land agreements in order to secure rights has increased as a result of the many problems however existing types of documentation were often unclear and had did not resemble any formal legal document.

eldis:A59910;Shaping forest safety nets with markets: Adaptation to climate change under changing roles of tropical forests in Congo Basin;;This paper explores the role of markets for Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) in facilitating climate change adaptation of local communities in the Congo Basin. While forests are regarded as safety nets in the climate change movement, emerging market systems that facilitate a shift to a more cash-based economy may reduce this traditional function. This paper contends that the size of trade in timber and non-timber forest products, overexploitation, and unsustainable practices threaten the integrity of forest ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. The disappearance of the traditional safety net, it is argued, may induce an enhanced vulnerability to climate change. Using case studies from two provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the authors assert that much of the monetary gains derived from NTFP markets benefit wholesalers and retailers rather than local people. Inequitable flows of revenue to local communities do not appear to justify the development of NTFP markets as an adaptation measure, at least not currently in the Congo basin. The key message of the paper is that market-based approaches, whether for forest products or for carbon, do not necessarily facilitate adaptation to climate change, and must be applied with caution to prevent creating new socio-economic issues. ;"J.

eldis:A37663;Maximising the contributions of local enterprises to the supply chain of oil, gas & mining projects in low income countries;;"A publication from Engineers Against Poverty for the extractive industries - an eight-page briefing note to guide oil, gas and mining (OGM) companies on how they can maximise the contribution of local enterprises to the supply chain of their projects in low income countries. It provides practical guidance on three major opportunity areas to increase local enterprise participation in project supply chains:

    modifying procurement policies and processes
    modifying contract documentation
    supporting the efficacy of supplier development programs

The briefing note, which contains six case studies from industry, draws on EAP’s expertise in contractor management, social development and procurement. In particular it highlights key lessons from EAP’s on-going research collaboration with the Institution of Civil Engineers, which is investigating how social objectives can be delivered through procurement processes.The quantity of investment in OGM projects in developing countries over the next twenty years is likely to be much greater than total international aid flows. If this investment is designed and managed to maximise sustainable economic opportunities for local communities, it can make a major contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in many countries.Involving local businesses and especially small and medium enterprises in the project supply chain is a crucial part of this opportunity because of the vital role these businesses play in promoting job creation and distributing the benefits of economic development more widely.

eldis:A37664;Land suitability for oil palm in Kalimantan, Indonesia;;"There is an increasing global demand for oil palm, but its production provokes societal debate on the environmental and social aspects that surround it, particularly in southeast Asia. This study, at the request of request of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV), ISRIC-World Soil Information, Alterra and Plant Research International, assessed the biophysical land suitability for the production of oil palm in Kalimantan, Indonesia. 
The scientists conclude that about half of Kalimantan may be biophysically suitable for oil palm cultivation. Moderately well drained soils on a not too steep land cover about half of Kalimantan. These soils are acid and infertile, and therefore unsuitable for most food crops, but they are suitable for oil palm. From the viewpoint of physical suitability and ecological sustainability, a potential increase of production of oil palm should be realized through intensification of the present oil palm estates and expansion on already degraded areas, rather than clearing natural forest. This is especially relevant for (virgin) peat areas of where the development is unsustainable because of ecological disturbance of the peat ecosystem and associated losses of greenhouse gasses and peat fires. In the investigation, information on land suitability was combined with additional information such as present land use and land cover, land status in spatial planning. The report concludes that a significant part of the biophysically suitable area has restrictions for these additional criteria. The applied model for decision-support takes account of sustainability, present land use and vegetation, and land status and can be used for decision-making at the local level.  ";"S. Mantel

eldis:A65169;Land tenure and fast-tracking REDD+: time to reframe the debate?;;This paper argues that legal reform of land tenure will not take place fast enough to enable developing countries to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through REDD+. It highlights that a global agreement on REDD+ is needed by 2020, if the mechanism is to have a significant impact on mitigating climate change. However, legally defensible and enforceable land tenure rights, while a key enabling condition for effective and equitable REDD+, will not be achieved in most forest countries before this date. By drawing on examples from Nepal and Papua New Guinea, the paper demonstrates that limited enforcement and high cost can undermine the effectiveness of legal tenure reform, while forest-owning communities with weak legal rights may in practice exercise a high level of control over forest land. The paper concludes that policymakers should look to alternative policy options that can also create enabling conditions for REDD+, under existing legal frameworks. These include mapping national laws and policies across sectors to identify perverse incentives, loopholes and conflicting priorities that exacerbate the drivers of deforestation, and engaging civil society networks with national forestry initiatives. ;"A.

eldis:A44934;Agriculture and climate change: real problems, false solutions;;"Agriculture plays an important role in climate change, both as a contributor emitting greenhouse gasses (GHGs) and as a potential reducer of negative impacts. This paper gives an overview of how current and proposed agricultural practices affect climate change and how the proposed measures for mitigation and adaptation impact agriculture. The paper states that industrial agriculture, as currently practiced with monocultures and agrochemicals in a globalised production system, is a major contributor to climate change. It warns against the intensification of industrial agriculture, which is proposed as a solution to the problems of climate change, unless its impacts on climate are adequately addressed.The paper states that the proposed technical solutions, such as biochar, the replacement of fossil energy products with agricultural products, the potential development of genetically modified (GM) crops and the widespread use of industrial biomass processing biorefineries, are a diversion from what is actually required. In most cases the effectiveness and the possible negative impacts of the proposed measures are not yet assessed and the plants are in the early stages of development. The paper concludes that there is not enough land to account for the proposed projects and the possibility of gaining carbon credits could place even more pressure on smallholders and marginalised people. The proposals, far from mitigating climate change, can seriously worsen climate change impacts thus having devastating consequences on biodiversity.Recommendations include:

    recognise the multi-functional nature of agriculture
    small-scale farming within an ecosystem approach must be supported
    smallholder farmers, indigenous peoples and local communities need to be placed at the centre of policymaking
    local communities need agrarian reform, security of land tenure and recognition of their collective or common rights to seeds, land, water and soil
    funding should to be directed to shared and farmer-centred research
    governments must support land reform and small-scale agriculture.

eldis:A12867;Re-constructing rights to land: from discourse to entitlement;;The paper offers two models for looking at land reform as a human rights  issues in Namaqualand, South Africa. It argues that South African land reform needs to be grounded in  a human rights and policy discourse in local, real-world entitlement processes. It uses two theoretical models: an environmental entitlement framework: analyses how people turn resources into endowments, entitlements and capabilities. It emphasises diversity of stakeholders, differentiated communities and the dynamics of institutions and power relations a discourse theory:  used to analyse mediation, coherence and gaps between human rights doctrines, national policy and local perceptions. A political ecology perspective widens this approach by using environmental history and discourse analysis to examine how perceptions and practices of ‘rightful’ use of the environment have come into being ;P.

eldis:A67393;Abyei natural resources conflicts;;"This report explores the major factors underlying the violent conflict in Abyei. It aims to contribute to policy relevant knowledge of the link between resources and conflict and to propose a general framework for action.

This report examines the territorial attachment of conflicting groups and establishes a link between intensification of conflict and the changes in livelihoods resulting from environmental stresses and over exploitation of assets. The report will also examine efforts to demarcate borders and its potential for solving the problem. It will also explore the peace-building potential of envisioned peace parks in the ecologically sensitive zone of multiple jurisdictions, Abyei, with focus on the formation of conservation zones in which the sharing of physical space can build and sustain peace.

eldis:A29898;Agriculture and deforestation in tropical Asia: an analytical framework;;Utilises a number of situations observed in tropical Asia to motivate a simple trade-theoretical analysis of the implications of technological progress in agriculture. The models used recognise the factor and commodity market linkages between agriculture, forestry and other sectors in the economy, which serve as conduits through which technological progress and other changes in one sector transmit their influences throughout the economy.The author focusses on a few issues to shed light on some of the main mechanisms through which technological progress in agricultural sectors has an impact on deforestation. In particular the author concludes that the impact of technological progress in agriculture on forestry depends crucially on the degree to which agriculture that experiences such technological change directly competes with forestry for land. Thus, productivity improvements in crops such as rubber, tea, oil-palm or coffee, which are likely to compete for forested land, will aggravate deforestation while the Green Revolution in wet rice agriculture may have had a significant pro-forestry effect. However, the effect of low prices for food produced in the lowlands may not always be benign: lower food prices raise incomes and can stimulate demand for upland products, which may lead to increased deforestation.[author] To view full documents on mekonginfo requires registration (free). ;S Jayasuriya;;Mekonginfo;eldis;01/01/2001;en;"deforestation;land registration;environment;land tenure;agriculture";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A29898;http://www.mekonginfo.org/mrc_en/doclib.nsf/0/3FCA1631EB9D4F3847256B65000E294F/$FILE/FULLTEXT.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mekonginfo.org%2Fmrc_en%2Fdoclib.nsf%2F0%2F3FCA1631EB9D4F3847256B65000E294F%2F%24FILE%2FFULLTEXT.html;;;;"Agriculture and food;Forestry deforestation;Environment and Forestry;Forest policies and management;forestry deforestation causes;agriculture and forestry;Asia;Land tenure;Environment;forestry deforestation;Environmental protection natural resource management;Land registration;Agricultural policy"
eldis:A62778;The scope for reducing emissions from forestry and agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon;;This paper assesses the prospects of mitigating climate change through emission reductions from forestry and agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon. It uses official statistics, literature and case study material to identify the scope for emission reductions, in terms of potential additionality, opportunity costs, technological complexity, transaction costs, and risks of economic and environmental spill-over effects. The findings indicate a comparative advantage in the Brazilian Amazon of forest conservation based over land use modifying mitigation options, especially in terms of higher potential additionality in emission reductions. The review points to a series of regional development deficits that may come to hamper attempts to tap into the large-scale climate change mitigation potential often associated with the Amazon. ;J.

eldis:A66866;Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply;;"This report discusses the need and options to balance consumption with sustainable production, as changing trends in both the production and consumption of land-based products put increased pressure on land resources across the globe. It focuses on land-based products (food, fuels and fibre) and describes methods which enable countries to determine whether their consumption levels exceed sustainable supply capacities. Strategies and measures are outlined with the aim of allowing the adjustment of policy framework to balance consumption with these capacities.

eldis:A74118;The nutmeg and spice industry in Grenada: innovations and competitiveness;;"World over the nutmeg continues to be a prized spice because of its unique flavour and pharmaceutical properties.

Grenada is the enviable position of supplying one-fourth of the world demand, which in turn provides a major source of foreign exchange earnings to the country as well as a major source of income for a large segment of the population. However, the industry continues to be negatively affected by a declining interest in the crop due to labour issues, lack of organization with respect to marketing, falling prices and increasingly stringent international quality regulations.

The industry can benefit from innovations in primary processing which can shorten processing times and improve the quality of the dried nutmeg and mace. The industry can also benefit from the creativity and innovativeness of the processors which has given rise several local brands of nutmeg food and pharmaceutical products.

Improvements in primary and secondary processing, coupled with stronger institutional support and the forging of key international linkages to address the marketing issues can be the key to not only the survival, but the success of the Grenadian nutmeg industry.

eldis:A19430;The human right to food in Guatemala;;This paper presents an analysis of the actions and omissions of the Guatemala State in respect to its obligations under the human right to food, and also refers to several paradigmatic cases of violations of the right to food within the context of the indigenous population and land and labour conflicts. This situation shows that the State of Guatemala has not managed to comply with either the obligations described in the Peace Agreements (the Agreement relating to the rights of the indigenous peoples and the socioeconomic Agreement), or the obligations of the international law in force in Guatemala in matter of the International Covenant of Economic, Social, and Economic Rights.The paper makes a number of recommendations the state and the international community to put an end to the conflicts in the country, which include to establish rural development and food ensuring policies, including an integral agrarian reform that incorporates the proposals of the indigenous rural sector, and fulfilling the fundamental rights of the rural indigenous woman, particularly with respect to productive resources, reproductive health and political decision processes. ;"A.

eldis:A70149;Custodian farmers of agricultural biodiversity: selected profiles from South and South East Asia;;"Agriculture is the largest global user of biodiversity. Over-reliance on a handful of crops puts global food security at great risk especially in the context of climate change. Selected and used by generations of farmers, agricultural biodiversity contributes to reducing malnutrition, alleviating poverty and combating climate change challenges. This diversity has been in decline for decades and is now in danger of disappearing and efforts needed to conserve them using both ex situ and in situ approaches. Although most farmers practice ex situ conservation, global commitment to support on-farm conservation efforts have not yet yielded tangible or comprehensible interventions on the ground.

Despite this global scenario of biodiversity loss on farms and in the wild, there are still a few farmers, known as ‘Custodian Farmers’, who actively maintain, adapt and disseminate agricultural biodiversity and who posses the knowledge needed for its use and cultivation. This paper is a summary of the outcome of the workshop on “the Custodian Farmers Agricultural Biodiversity: Policy Support for their role in use and Conservation held from 11-12 February, 2013 in New Delhi, India. Organised jointly by Biodiversity International, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources and Protection of plant Varieties & Farmers Rights Authority, the workshop

The workshop, which drew 20 participants from India, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand and Malaysia, was instrumental in developing a ‘responsibilities and rights’ framework for the identification of policy support to custodian farmers. Some recommendations made at the workshop include, among others:


	Advocate for special recognition of custodian farmers
	Create and raise awareness of the roles, responsibilities and rights of custodian farmers
	Support the identification and documentation of 1000 farmers case studies
	Establish and recognise networks of custodian farmers
	Assess the importance of custodian farmers for on-farm/in situ conservation
	Acceptance of farmers elite/unique materials for registration
	Formulate national on-farm/in situ conservation strategy


Mobilise social capital for locally driven financial assets to establish community biodiversity management funds.

eldis:A74307;The urban-rural water interface: a preliminary study in Burkina Faso;;"Decisions on water allocation and infrastructure lie at the heart of development planning in semi-arid lands. On paper, the laws and policies of Burkina Faso accord equal entitlement to drinking water for the residents of cities and the residents of small towns and villages.

In practice, Ouagadougou’s status as economic and administrative capital gives it much greater power to plan for and mobilise investment for its own water supplies. The Ziga project (in two phases) has been designed to secure bulk water supply for Ouagadougou until 2030.

For local people in the Ziga area on the White Volta/Nakambé River, the project has brought some positive benefits and some negative impacts. Thriving rural communities need water for productive use, yet the government bans villages around the Ziga reservoir (upstream of the Ziga dam) from irrigating from the lake (to protect water quality from the use of polluting chemicals) and they are not receiving support to create alternative revenue-generating activities. ‘Development’, said a local leader, ‘is based on social peace.

As long as we do not receive assistance in recognition of the consequences of the dam, there is a problem that needs to be resolved.

eldis:A29895;A survey of indigenous land tenure: a report for the Land Tenure Service of the FAO;;This study provides a concise overview of the information available on the land rights of indigenous peoples, with a focus on those in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. Successive chapters summarise the rights of indigenous peoples in international law and then examine how these rights are being recognised, or not, in Latin America, Africa and the Asia-Pacific. A final chapter reviews the findings of the survey and identifies key issues to be considered in making policy decisions about indigenous land rights.A detailed list of recommendations of ways of promoting indigenous land rights is included, giving emphasis to the importance of giving indigenous peoples themselves a decisive voice in their own development. The report concludes by noting that there remain huge knowledge gaps about the relationships between tenure systems and food security and between indigenous rights and national laws. ;"M. Colchester

eldis:A10914;Rural land management in Zambia: the need for institutional and land tenure reforms;;This study contends that Zambia cannot develop if it neglects policy for the efficient utilization of its natural resources. One such area has been the absence of land policy for effective management of rural land.While failure in this area has been attributed to a number of factors, notably absence of credit and funding, this paper contends that the base factor is the absence of efficient land management for rural land.This paper attempts to show that rural land in Zambia remains undeveloped for a number of reasons:The absence of an institutional framework to guide land administration. No matter how much money is invested in the system as it currently stands, positive results cannot be guaranteed due to a very weak institutional base.The establishment of rural land management institutions would lead to a second phase of reforms - land tenure reforms. Prescribing the “right” land tenure system for rural Zambia is not possible in the absence of detailed field surveys. This presents a challenge to all researchers, NGO’s, government and stakeholdersThe paper concludes with a quote by West which it feels best sums up the findings of this paper:“Europe is at present offering two basic land tenure models to Africa, the individualist or the collectivist, and neither of them is immediately acceptable. The need for tenure conversion presents to African countries a unique opportunity for innovation, invention and planning. This opportunity must be seized in order to avoid not only the undesirable social consequences of unfettered private enterprises, but also, alternatively, the disincentives and diseconomies that have been found to accompany certain forms of collectivism”.The onus is on everybody in Zambia to assist in the directing of rural policy. ;E.

eldis:A41212;Arab Environment Future Challenges: 2008 Report of the Arab Forum for Environment and Development;;"The state of the Arab environment stands at a pivotal juncture with numerous environmental problems both current and imminently threatening the region. Among the major challenges being faced are water scarcity, land degradation and desertification, inadequate waste management, coastal and marine environment degradation and air pollution. This report, the first of its kind to be compiled and authored by independent experts from across the Arab region, offers an overview of the state of the environment in the Arab world, highlighting environmental challenges, social, political and demographic trends, progress in regional and sub-regional cooperation and recommendations for future action. The report attempts to address five key questions: 

    how are the environmental conditions in the Arab world changing? 
    what are the causes of environmental deterioration, and how is it linked to human activities and other stresses? 
    why is the environment a significant issue in the Arab world? 
    what is being done about it? How is society responding to the issues through public and private institutions? 
    are the measures taken to limit environmental degradation and deterioration of ecosystems enough? 

While the report commends the long-term planning such as schemes addressing renewable energy, it also stresses that the importance of simple measures urgently required at the local level to ensure more efficient and sound use of resources. [adapted from the authors]  ";"M.K. Tolba (ed)

eldis:A65303;The politics of evidence: methodologies for understanding the global land rush;;"The most recent ‘land rush’ precipitated by the convergent ‘crises’ of fuel, feed and food in 2007–2008 has heightened the debate on the consequences of land investments, with widespread media coverage, policy commentary and civil society engagement. This ‘land rush’ has been accompanied by a ‘literature rush’, with a fast-growing body of reports, articles, tables and books with varied purposes, metrics and methods. Land grabbing, as it is popularly called, is now a hot political topic around the world, discussed amongst the highest circles. This is why getting the facts right is very important and having effective methodologies for doing so is crucial. Several global initiatives have been created to aggregate information on land deals, and to describe their scale, character and distribution. All have contributed to building a bigger (if not always better) picture of the phenomenon, but all have struggled with methodology. This JPS Forum identifies a profound uncertainty about what it is that is being counted, questions the methods used to collate and aggregate ‘land grabs’, and calls for a second phase of land grab research which abandons the aim of deriving total numbers of hectares in favour of more specific, grounded and transparent methods.

What sustainable funding base will support Catchment Management Authorities?a broadened definition of stakeholders and more democratic processes of selection may make the shift of responsibilities from the Ministry of Water Development to the National Water Resources Board and Catchment Management Authorities more effective. Representatives from other user groups such as women should be addedmany rural people recognize a right to water which is not expressed solely in economic terms. Alternative understandings of value might serve as strong rationales and motivators for conserving trees, watersheds, water sources and other natural resourcesMalawi could set an example in the region by expanding the voice and representation of women in the water reform process. Women play a major role in agricultural production and marketing and they rely on a wide array of natural resources as well. They should be featured in the new water policy and efforts should be made to include them in newly-formed decision-making bodies at all levels ;"A. E. Ferguson

eldis:A65594;Large-scale land acquisition in Africa ;;" Large-scale land investment is not a new phenomenon in Africa, but the speed and scale at which it is occurring today makes it one of the most pressing issues on the continent. These land investments are promoted by advocates as “win-win” solutions - benefiting national economies, rural development and ensuring food security at the same time. Critics on the other hand view large-scale land acquisitions as “land grabbing”, a process that undermines local land rights and that disproportionately affects the socially and economically vulnerable who bear the bulk of the costs while reaping few of the benefits of the transactions.

This fact sheet has been produced by GRID-Arendal in collaboration with partners to highlight some of the key aspects of large-scale land investments in Africa.

eldis:A14418;State courts and the regulation of land disputes in Ghana: the litigants’ perspective;;This paper argues that Ghanaian litigants in land disputes favour authoritative state legal-institutions over out-of-court settlements. Current policy debates on how to protect the land rights of the majority of customary land holders revolve around the respective merits of customary and non-state regulation (said to be accessible, flexible and socially embedded) versus state systems, which are said to offer more certainty, impartiality and nondiscriminatory codes and procedures. In Ghana, customary and state legal codes have been integrated for some time, and the state courts (which are frequently used as first instance adjudicators) apply customary rules.Drawing on interviews and surveys conducted within three state courts the following themes are considered:the state and non-state regulation of land disputes in Ghanawhy it is that people go to courtthe background to court systems and their effectiveness in solving land disputesproblems and experiences associated with litigation, how 'user-friendly' the courts areThe author concludes that:despite problems and time delays, an authoritative and enforceable settlement in a state court was favoured by litigantslitigants often had a positive view of the court process, viewing it as an essential part of establishing their land rightsthe courts are not alien and inappropriate in rulings, as frequently supposedjudges were well respected and perceived as flexible and 'user-friendly' by litigantslitigants extreme reluctance to entertain out-of-court settlements casts doubt on the notion that proposals to move to more use of Alternative Dispute Resolutions (ADRs) will be successful if they fail to offer equivalent authority, fairness and enforceability. ;R.

The report focuses on the 1997-1998 forest fires in Indonesia that resulted in the burning of 10 million hectares of forests. Many of these fires were deliberately set by plantation owners who take advantage of the dry season to clear the forests and plant export crops like palm oil. The problem was worsened by a drought induced by the periodic El Niño climatic phenomenon, which was particularly severe that year.The report recommends: Instituting a moratorium on new concessions for oil palm, timber and other plantations until a national inventory of permanent forest estate is completedStrengthening rules and penalties against clearing plantations with fireDeclaring a five-year moratorium on the transmigration program and re-examining the objectives and methods of this massive resettlement programGranting legal protection of forest ownership and use by indigenous peoples and assisting them to manage the forests sustainablyGranting clear legal protection as permanent forest estate to all remaining forested areas in IndonesiaEstablishing effective mechanisms for independent citizen monitoring of trends and threats related to forest lands and resources ;;;World Resources Institute, Washington DC;eldis;01/01/2000;en;"deforestation;forestry;environment";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"IDN;030;009";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A28425;http://pubs.wri.org/pubs_pdf.cfm?PubID=3015;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpubs.wri.org%2Fpubs_pdf.cfm%3FPubID%3D3015;;;;"deforestation;Illegal logging;Forestry deforestation;logging;Forest policies and management;forestry deforestation causes;Fire;New wars;resettlement;forestry;forestry deforestation;Forest industries;Environmental protection natural resource management;Agriculture and food;Conflict and security;Forestry timber trade;Environment and Forestry;Security;Environment;timber"
eldis:A21546;Trade and conflict;;This report examines the theoretical underpinnings of trade and conflict, and lays out the debate on how free trade affects conflict. In order to do so it examines the political economy of violence and how globalisation has factored into recent international and internal armed conflicts.The report highlights different theoretical approaches:the classic neo-liberal argument is that increased international trade makes conflict too costly, and thus countries that participate in trade are more likely to be peaceful other theories leaning on the  neo-liberal argument argue that trade reduces conflict, but only when trade is symmetrical between countries or when countries trade in certain kinds of goodsdependency theorists argue that trade patterns between core (industrialised) countries and periphery (unindustrialised) countries deepen existing inequalities and provoke international conflict.The report also highlights that countries that trade in natural resources are more prone to internal conflict than countries that trade in manufactured goods, with the risk of conflict increasing when a country relies on natural resources for 30% or more of its GDP.The problem with this high-level of dependence on natural resources is two-fold: first, the inequitable manner in which natural resources are extracted and traded tends to create tensions between the economic elite and the local populationsecond, natural resources provide ripe economic opportunities for repressive governments and violent rebels to finance themselves during conflict episodes.The report argues that while making money has always been part of making war, now making money has become the ultimate end, which means that the point is not to win the war, resolve the conflict, and return to peace, but rather to feed the wartime economy. In that context globalisation has contributed to a number of factors making it easier to fuel war time economies. These include open global markets for selling illegally extracted resources, unethical foreign companies willing to buy illegal concessions, bargain with rebels, or cooperate with a corrupt and repressive regime, and a free flow of small arms from other countries. ;;;Center for International Development, Harvard University;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A21546;http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/features/tradeconflict.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cid.harvard.edu%2Fcidtrade%2Ffeatures%2Ftradeconflict.pdf;;;;"war economies;Conflict and security;Stakeholders in conflict;Business;trade theories;Trade Policy;Trade Liberalisation;climate change as driver of conflict;Business and conflict;trade and conflict;Extractive industries;extractive industries;Liberalisation Impacts;Corporate Social Responsibility;Drivers of conflict"
eldis:A11588;Better livelihoods for poor people: the role of land policy;;"This DFID consultation paper examines the importance of land, land rights and land reform in developing countries, and considers how land policies can contribute to poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It advocates a rights-based approach to land through advocacy and representation of the poor in land management.The paper begins by outlining the benefits of secure and equitable access to land and good land and in this context discusses challenges and opportunities in developing pro-poor land policy: Key challenges are identified as:equitable access, especially for minority groups and women; secure tenure in land rights, including rights to common property and other forms of rights in land; governance, in particular the administration of land rights;  financial and political sustainability. The authors then look at the how these issues might be integrated into poverty strategies and discuss the implications for DFID policy and practice.Strategy considerations include:The expensive and long-term processes involved in land reform may present problems for planning and budgetary cyclesThe political nature of land reform means that the social impacts have frequently not been adequately assessed. Development partner coordination in the land sector has not always been effective and there has been a tendency for donors to support stand-alone, technically driven projects based on pre-conceived models. National stakeholders, including a wide range of government, civil society and community stakeholders, must be effectively engaged in the development of land policy. Governments should avoid raising unrealistic expectations, especially where powerful vested interests may be difficult to overcome. In these circumstances there may be a role for donors to support pro-poor advocacy and civil society groups provided genuine dialogue is facilitated.Land cannot be addressed in isolation from other sectors particularly agriculture, provision of basic services, financial services and access to markets. Poverty reduction strategy (PRS) processes provide a key opportunity. However land is one of the issues that many current PRS papers fail to address wellFurther comments and feedback are most welcome up to the end of December 2002, addressed to Julian Quan at:

eldis:A62516;Assessment of the impacts and adaptive capacity of the Machobane farming system to climate change in Lesotho;;Agriculture remains a major source of income for more than 80 per cent of the rural population in Lesotho, although the country's arable land is only about nine per cent of the total land area. Moreover, the rural economy has been declining due to poor land and water resources management, unsustainable farming practices and unpredictable weather conditions. Communities living on marginal lands whose livelihoods depend on natural recourses are among the most vulnerable to climate change. The Machobane farming system (MfS), discussed in this paper, is a practice with high adaptability and resilience to climate change developed by Dr. Machobane in the late 1950s. In addition to documenting the historical, current status and future prospects of the system and its adaptability and resilience to climate change, this study also assesses the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of its soil, and presents the challenges and vulnerability of the Machobane farming system. ;S.

eldis:A16778;Sustainable development in mineral economies: the example of Botswana;;"Mineral wealth often detracts from, rather than enhances, the economic performance of developing countries, a phenomenon known as the “resource curse”.  The need to finance basic government expenditure, as well as rent-seeking behaviour by individuals and interest groups, puts pressure on developing country governments to spend mineral revenues rather than reinvest them.  Consequently the depletion of minerals is not offset by a compensating increase in other forms of capital.Botswana, however, has consistently reinvested most of its mineral revenues in accordance with criteria aimed at sustainability and increasing the stock of physical and human capital, and has a long-term framework for setting policy.This paper reviews Botswana’s economic sustainability over the past 20 years, using environmental accounts to assess the value of mineral assets.  It compares Botswana’s performance to the rule that the total amount of capital (including mineral assets and net foreign financial assets) should be maintained at the same level.  It also analyses the process by which mineral revenues have been transformed into other forms of wealth and attempts to draw conclusions about the management of mineral resources.Its findings include: Botswana’s Sustainable Budget Index (SBI), a policy rule requiring that all mineral revenues be reinvested, has worked well in the past but may be less useful for the future not all of public sector investment has been productive, and a better allocation of mineral revenues might improve the sustainability of the economy the SBI was not based on an objective with a well-defined target, such as a given percentage increase in per capita GDP; consequently, there were no criteria for allocation of mineral revenues, or for evaluating a given allocation HIV/AIDS has further complicated the problem of efficiently allocating public investment funds, since it has lowered the productivity of much of the public infrastructure and made higher health spending necessary simply to maintain current human capital. Its suggestions for policy include: as productivity of public investments in Botswana diminishes, it could consider establishing a permanent fund for distributing mineral revenues directly to citizens use of well-defined targets for policy, in order to optimise allocation of mineral revenues among alternative investments, and between current and future consumption the country’s 6-year National Development Plans address medium-term objectives, but there is a need to move towards longer term planning for investment strategy.

This paper looks at why the authority and capacity of customary natural resource management institutions has been weakened, and how this impacts on resource governance and climate resilience. The case study included looks at a new hybrid form of customary/formal institution that is emerging as a response to the stagnation of development and increasing conflict around resource access.

The paper demonstrates that legitimising and supporting customary institutions can be a more successful and sustainable approach to addressing the ‘drylands development deficit’ than projects that focus on technical fixes or work in parallel to customary institutions.

eldis:A74070;Distribution of mangrove habitats of Grenada and the Grenadines;;"Climate change is expected to alter existing coastal habitats in Grenada, jeopardizing the island's mangroves, such as through the conversion of basin mangroves to fringe habitats as storm surges open barrier beaches, increasing tidal action and flood duration.

Likewise, incremental sea level rise and storm overwash can lead to increased salinity within coastal ponds, backwaters, and estuaries.

Each of these processes, acting alone or in concert, can greatly affect colonization by all mangrove species that occur in the region.

Climate-induced changes and human development are expected to affect the long-term distribution of mangrove forest types and the researchers suggest, must be considered in long-term conservation and management planning to ensure protection of the diversity of both existing and potential future mangrove habitats and the varied ecosystem functions and values that each provide.

eldis:A76338;Avoiding the resource curse in Lebanon;;"The discovery and extraction of oil and gas off the shores of Lebanon could ultimately translate into a boom in revenues for the government, which in light of current poor fiscal planning could lead to an uncontrolled expansionary budget policy and eventually a ‘resource curse’. If these revenues are spent with no oversight and proper planning, the country m ay well collect and allocate large streams of cash that make limited contributions to economic development. But the ‘resource curse’ could be avoided if appropriate policy adjustments are implemented in conjunction with the development of offshore hydrocarbon resources.
The successful experiences of a few resource-rich countries like Norway have been largely attributed to properly managing resource wealth and its associated risks. The optimal response that takes advantage of the boom while mitigating its potential negative implications includes a set of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and structural reform policies.
As Lebanon stands poised to establish its oil and gas sector and possibly profit from new resource wealth, it has become increasingly critical for this small economy to implement public policies that take advantage of the oil boom while mitigating its potential negative implications. This typically includes a set of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and structural reform policies which are required to avoid the resource curse.
Indeed, the government must resist pressures to enjoy all the windfall revenues in the short run and recklessly expand its budget expenditure. On the contrary, it must commit to saving part of the revenue proceeds every period in order to attain a permanent wealth increase. Ideally, the government must direct its spending toward the non-resource tradables sector through subsidizing outputs and/or inputs or investing in physical and human capital to enhance productivity in these sectors. In this case, a budget expansion would not necessarily lead to shrinkage of the productive sectors. It is clear, however, that proper public financial management is central to the above macroeconomic policy framework. Key to the above analysis and recommendations is the political economy and institutional setup, especially the role and proper functioning of fiscal institutions. Increasing accountability and transparency in public institutions is essential, and this ultimately requires political reforms that increase the commitment and engagement of citizens in the actions of their government, through proper electoral representation.

With around 80 per cent of the population of the Eastern African region dependent on agriculture which is at risk from climate change impacts, particularly increasing water scarcity and more variable rainfall and seasonal patterns, countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia face a pressing need to implement climate adaptation measures. This report presents the evidence from a FAO-Sida supported pilot project within these three countries, which targeted intervention at strengthening community and individual producers adaptive capacity using different institutional training mechanisms tailored to each country-specific context. 
The paper is split into two parts. First, a planning framework for adaptation at the local level is presented, before project findings are outlined. Overall, the project demonstrated that a substantial boost in investment is needed, and that one-size does not fit all; different local factors, including biophysical, socioeconomic, and land ownership, determines the correct approach to take. With regard to scaling up adaptation efforts, a number of issues must be addressed within the four themes identified as priorities: increasing soil health; water conservation; livelihood diversification, and the strengthening of local institutions. These recommendations include better utilisation of scientific knowledge and technology, a variety of sustainable practice and resource management approaches, the adoption of more short-term crops better suited to variable rainfall, and greater organisation and cooperation between farmers. The second part of the report consists of a number of case studies from the pilot in each of the three countries studied. A background to each study site and approach is then described. In Ethiopia, the focus was on community-based, participatory integrated water management while in Tanzania and Kenya the focus was on the strengthening of capacity for climate change adaptation through sustainable land and water management. For each site, specific interventions are then examined - two in Ethiopia, and five in each of Tanzania and Kenya. These include protecting farm land and homestead areas from unpredictable floods in Ethiopia; marketable banana production for enhanced incomes and food security in Kenya; and Beekeeping as an incentive for participatory forestry, land, and water management in Tanzania.

eldis:A70962;Trees on farms: an update and reanalysis of agroforestry’s global extent and socio-ecological characteristics;;"Agroforestry, the inclusion of woody perennials within farming systems, has been widespread throughout the tropics as a traditional land use developed by subsistence farmers and, more recently, as an important livelihoods’ option promoted by land-use managers and international development agencies. Agroforestry systems range from subsistence livestock and pastoral systems to home gardens, alley intercropping, and biomass plantations with a wide diversity of biophysical conditions and socio-ecological characteristics. Tree cover apparently is still on the increase as a common feature on agricultural land throughout the world. It is essential that this is recognized by all involved in agricultural production, planning and policy development.

eldis:A11456;Civil society and governance case study of land distribution programme to Kol tribals in Chitrakot district Uttar Pradesh;;The Kol tribals of  Chitrakoot district live a life of abject poverty, exploitation and almost complete subjugation to the feudal landowners, locally known as Dadus. A local civil society organisation, the Akhil Bhartiya Samaj Sewa Sansthan (ABSSS) has adopted a multi-pronged approach to simultaneously address three sets of issues which it felt were crucial for improving the lot of the Kols. These were:creating awareness among the Kols about their own situation and the need for organised effort to break the shackles of feudal exploitationcreating awareness among the wider society, including the government machinery at the district and state levels, about the grinding poverty, misery and exploitation of the Kolsand taking up specific development programmes on its own, and influencing the government system on behalf of the Kols, to ensure that the benefits of development and welfare programmes actually reach the people for whom they are intendedThis case study deals with the programme of distribution of land Pattas (titles) to Kol tribals in Chitrakoot district of southern Uttar Pradesh. The ABSSS has played a leading role in the implementation of the government programme of providing land titles to the poor and socially disadvantaged sections of society, mainly scheduled castes and tribes in the district. This study focusses on the role of this organisation and its contribution to governance in the context of the specific programme.The paper concludes by reflecting on how the study illustrates the tremendous odds against which any programme of economic uplift and empowerment of the poor and oppressed, especially in a tradition-bound by feudal social and economic order, has to contend. There is a clear clash between the philosophy of social justice and commitment to uplift the poor and the oppressed enshrined in the constitution and subscribed to by all major political parties on the one hand, and the actual implementation of legislation and programmes formulated to give flesh and blood to these constitutional directives on the other.The success of the ABSSS has been built on the multi-pronged approach which it has adopted towards the problem. At one level, it has sought to make the Kols aware of their legal rights, especially to the land given on Patta to them and how they were being violated by the dominant feudal interests. It has also pursued the land cases of the Kols in the courts and provided legal assistance through legal aid camps organised by it. At another level, it has exerted pressure on the administration at the sub-division, district and state levels to force it to implement the land distribution programme in its true spirit. It has helped in spreading information about the condition of the Kols in Patha, and built alliances with other Civil Society Organisations in other parts of the country and with influential leaders, opinion and policy makers etc. ;B.

eldis:A11698;Forest certification: enhancing social forestry developments?;;The author begins by providing a brief overview of the concept and reasoning behind certification of forest products. She states that, at the outset, one of the aims of certification was to provide market access and other benefits for small-scale, low-impact, community run ‘eco-timber’ projects. However, she argues, current figures of forest enterprises certified under the scheme of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) suggest that rather than giving market access to social forestry enterprises, certification might work in favour of classical‘industrial forest management'.Despite these figures, the paper argues that certification can help to strengthen social forestry approaches through external recognition and internal consolidation of management capacities and that forest certification, rather than blocking reform, can act as a catalyst for structural and institutional change in the forest sector.Limitations to certification's impact on social forestry are considered to be that certification has no mechanism to facilitate consistent access to the market potential for certified products. Moreover, current certification practice and standards are not well adapted to match the diverse land management objectives and social equity issues of forest managing communities.Registration is necessary  before access to this free document ;B.

eldis:A41674;In search of common ground: adaptive collaborative management in Cameroon;;"In developing countries, forest management, sharing and collaboration has encountered major problems as reflected in Southern Cameroon’s forested landscape, which is challenged by differences in power, knowledge gaps, and competing land rights claims. The authors use Cameroon’s forests, as an integral part of research on adaptive collaborative management (ACM) across three continents. As both a research programme and a strategy for management, ACM seeks to understand the conditions under which forest stakeholders can learn and collaborate to adapt management in a conscious and continuous manner. 
At its core, ACM seeks to explore the validity of cooperative and learning frameworks for addressing human wants and capabilities in the face of conflict, diversity and instability. The authors look at conditions that can lead to:

    enhanced collaboration and adaptation or adaptive failures in forest management
    collaboration as a tool for enhancing social learning and adaptation
    the kind of approaches, methods and concepts that work in catalysing ACM interventions in various conditions
    the effects of ACM processes and outcomes on forest and human well-being, and whether deliberate ACM intervention is useful or necessary to enhance forest and human well-being. 

The authors identify three types of adaptive pressures in stakeholder relations namely assimilation, compromise and consensus. They argue that learning takes place when social actors interact, as social learning enhances the capacities of the learners and translates more easily than anticipated into local ownership of concepts and approaches. This is seen as a key to adaptation.  
The following recommendations are made by the authors to further enhance ACM:

    community management systems require the integration of traditional and legal definitions of community, forest and resources
    improve governance at all levels including rural areas to ensuring that social sustainability of community forests is a tool for local governance and economic development
    effective facilitation enables social learning and adaptation but requires other collaborative incentives to translate into effective collaborative frameworks
    adaptive management in multistakeholder forest situations is not likely without effective stakeholder collaboration and that collaboration will be limited without appropriate policy incentives and effective independent facilitation
    iterative feedback loops between research, local experience and policy adjustments is the means for strengthening positive interactions between cooperation and adaptation.

eldis:A69596;Making urban land markets work better in South African cities and towns: arguing the basis for access by the poor;;"Contemporary and historical state interventions in South African cities and towns have distorted urban land markets affecting especially the poor. Although partly underpinned by a formidable land administration system and a strong land rights base, South African cities and towns continue to manifest the historic inequality of class and race in their spatial land use and ownership patterns. This is reflected in, and reinforced by, unequal access to markets in land, housing, property in general, and development and use rights which has resulted in market failure for less wealthy individuals and households in their attempts to find places to live, trade and manufacture in order to earn a decent living. This paper discusses the balance between state allocation of urban land and market distribution of land as a resource, an asset which inevitably becomes a commodity which can be used by the poor more or less effectively to alleviate poverty. Observations are made about how the market has been distorted, and why it would make good sense (socially, economically and ideologically) for poorer communities to be better located in South African urban areas.

The author concludes that this distortion does not favour the poor and the implication is that the poor will remain poor, victims of jobless and landless growth, endless recipients of state allocation, and dislocated to the urban periphery. S/he portends that crude attempts to bring the two economies together may have the opposite rather than the desired effect and suggests deliberate bending markets slightly using state interventions in a circumspect manner as have been done in other parts of the world. The author cautions that for this to be achieved, there is need to further build the capacity of officials to negotiate with market players, reduce administrative costs and complexities, make market information available to potential sellers and buyers, extract value and disburse responsibly, bring urban actors together around common actions, transfer best practices and cleverly predict and monitor the impacts of the interventions.

eldis:A65762;Sustainable Intensification: A New Paradigm for African Agriculture;;Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to global challenges such as food insecurity, climate change, rural poverty, malnutrition and environmental protection. This puts pressure on the fragile food production system. The term ‘Sustainable Intensification’ – ‘producing more outputs with more efficient use of all inputs on a durable basis, while reducing environmental damage and building resilience, natural capital and the flow of environmental services’ – has become synonymous with big, industrial agriculture. The writers of the report are concerned that as the world’s population grows, there is a risk that we will lose sight of the scientific value and relevance of the term, including to smallholder farmers. The report provides examples of how Sustainable Intensification is being used by smallholder farmers in Africa to address the continent’s food and nutrition crisis. ;Montpelier Panel;;Imperial College, University of London;eldis;01/01/2013;en;"environment;climate change;land use;agriculture";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A65762;https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/africanagriculturaldevelopment/Public/Montpellier%20Panel%20Report%202013%20-%20Sustainable%20Intensification%20-%20A%20New%20Paradigm%20for%20African%20Agriculture.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.imperial.ac.uk%2Fafricanagriculturaldevelopment%2FPublic%2FMontpellier%2520Panel%2520Report%25202013%2520-%2520Sustainable%2520Intensification%2520-%2520A%2520New%2520Paradigm%2520for%2520African%2520Agriculture.pdf;;;;"Environment;Nutrition;Climate change;Land use;smallholder farmers;CDKN;Agriculture and food;Source;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;Sustainable Intensification;Funder;Climate change agriculture and food security;Bookmarklet;resilience"
eldis:A41707;REDD strategies for high carbon rural development;;"Large areas of the humid tropics are like mosaics, combining features of forests and agriculture and housing hundreds of millions of people. Land uses that store high quantities of carbon, such as agroforestry and other tree-based systems, make up a large part of those mosaic areas. Yet current discussions on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) within the UNFCCC do not adequately address these land uses as part of a potential mitigation strategy. This policy brief highlights evidence showing the potential of such land uses for storing carbon, stabilising forest resources and generating income. Policies and strategies that harness this potential can contribute to high carbon rural development in the humid tropics. 
Key observations include:

    important drivers of deforestation in areas of mixed agriculture - forest land use. More dynamic change occurs in mixed forest-agriculture mosaics and forest margins in tropical landscapes than in forest cores
    multiple pathways of change determine carbon and livelihoods - change in forest-agriculture mosaics in tropical countries can take many different pathways, which are characterised by different types of forest and tree cover, quantities of carbon, economic returns, and environmental outcomes
    intermediate land uses can contribute to REDD objectives - agroforestry systems that are intermediate between natural forests and intensive foodcrop systems can conserve and sequester high amounts of carbon and generate moderate to high income for farmers compared to other land uses.

eldis:A14960;New stakeholders and the promotion of agro-silvo-pastoral activities in southern Burkina Faso: false start or inexperience?;;This paper explores and evaluates the impact of a new form of large-scale agriculture which is becoming an increasing phenomenon in southern Burkina Faso. With severe ecological deterioration and food deficits, small-scale agriculture is usually seen as the key to economic prosperity, social solidarity and sustainable management of local resources. However, a set of new stakeholders, comprising politicians, entrepreneurs and employees, is promoting large-scale agribusiness as a relevant and viable alternative for agricultural development in the country. This paper questions this argument.Conclusions include:the new form of large-scale agribusiness can only work if those promoting it have a clear plan that allows them to increase productivitymost new stakeholders have only vague ideas that are not formalised, and they act spontaneously with no real knowledge of the costs of setting up a large-scale farm or of the technical, economic and financial options availablethese stakeholders start their activity by clearing the land allocated and then cultivate it for many years without any additional inputs such as tree planting, erosion control or use of organic matter. This has disastrous consequences for the environment and plays a part in further erosion of the natural potential of the areas concernedthe process is increasingly coming to resemble land-grabbing that may, in the short or medium term, cause social tension when the resource shrinksthere can be no increased investment in the agricultural sector without consistent, appropriate measures to provide greater security of tenurecurrently the smallest farm is more cost-effective than large-scale farms in southern Burkina Faso, and therefore measures are necessary to ensure that the promotion of agribusiness is not undertaken to the detriment of small family farmsthere are examples that show that if conditions are right (transport facilities and, above all, marketing networks), small farmers are able to make significant progress towards modernising farming.[adapted from author] ;M.

eldis:A65607;Local vulnerability, Forest communities and Forestcarbon conservation: case of southern Cameroon;;This research paper, published in the international Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation, reports on a study of two community forests', Nomedjoh and Nkolenyeng, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects located in south Cameroon. Focus group sessions and household surveys were conducted to examine the relationship between the adaptation of forest communities and the mitigation of forest-carbon conservation, and the impact this has on local vulnerability. Five main topics to arise from the discussion:   Perception of vulnerability to climatic variability - majorities in both communities expressed observable variations in temperature and sunshine, rainfall, and sowing and harvesting periods. Complaints from respondents include interruption of production patterns, abortive crop germinations, and disrupted post-harvest preservation practices.   Vulnerability to non-climatic stresses - access to resources, income, food security, knowledge, and technology all contribute to adaptive capacity. Conservation conditions can also have implications, as seen in Nkolenyeng where prohibition of slash-and-burn practices has affected the predominantly agricultural community.   Adaptation to local climate variability and forest carbon conservation conditions - income diversification is required to reduce vulnerability. Expansion of cultivation areas into virgin forest is a coping strategy used in both sites, whilst garden farming is popular with households in Nomedjoh. Better market-prices and infrastructure will improve the adaptive capacity of households, with other factors highlighted including improved crop varieties, food storage, and training.   Forest carbon conservation projects and adaptation opportunities - Income diversification, agriculture intensification, and agro-forestry are all mitigation strategies that can reduce vulnerability, while conservation and restoration of forests is vital for communities' adaptation capacity.    Communities' willingness to participate and adhere to carbon conservation conditions - This largely depends on how communities are incentivised, and perceptions regarding equity and participation in decision making. Findings suggest that the PES project was welcome, though discontent at early exploitative deals contributes to a feeling of distrust in Nkolenyeng.   The report concludes that there are commonalities between the adaptation needs of forest communities and their motivation to participate and respect forest conservation initiatives. Such 'double-response' strategies can be better designed by using vulnerability as a departure point, though more research is required regarding gender and vulnerable group differentiation. ;"E.L.

eldis:A63332;Climate change: impact, adaptation and vulnerability in water supply of Kathmandu Valley;;Climate change can affect water supply in Nepal by its impact on precipitation, glacier melting and increase in temperature. This study identifies the vulnerability of the water supply system in Kathmandu Valley to the impact of the worst case scenario of climate change and suggests adaptation strategies to deal with the situation. It finds that existing strategies are insufficient and more than five million people would be deprived of the minimum needed water by 2050 under the driest scenario. Similarly, the reduction in low flow under the driest scenario or frequent extreme rainfall events under the wettest scenario could further degrade the water quality and increase the vulnerability of water supply infrastructures. The study suggests a combination of strategies to help manage the situation until 2050. The situation, however, would become worse after 2050 due to the projected sharp reduction in precipitation, making all precipitation-dependent water supply strategies ineffective. ;P. K.

eldis:A65601;REDD+ and indigenous people;;"1 KEY MESSAGES


	Conflicts between indigenous peoples with territorial rights and other local groups like landless and migrants should be taken into account when planning REDD+ national strategies and action plans.
	Acknowledging that indigenous communities are also engaged with markets and external actors, and may prioritize “immediate needs”, is important for the understanding of their livelihoods, decision-making processes and positions regarding REDD+.
	Assessments and information about the possible consequences of REDD+ in local areas should be presented in local languages. Participatory budgeting provides interesting experience for fair benefit sharing schemes, which could also be included in REDD+ activities. The participation of women is essential.
	Indigenous peoples organizations and local communities in favor of REDD+ see it as a possibility to strengthen territorial control and self-management, and demand respect for their rights, territories and autonomy, with adequate consultation processes.

eldis:A18965;Access to land, growth and poverty reduction in Malawi;;"After four decades of agricultural-led development strategies in the postindependent Malawi, economic growth has been erratic and a large proportion of the population live below the poverty line and studies suggests that the poverty situation has worsened. Agricultural policies favoured large-scale (estate) production at the expense of smallholder farmers who account for more than 80 percent of households. Smallholder farmers face several constraints including landlessness and small land holdings and declining agricultural productivity.This study argues that past agricultural strategies have been less successful because they ignored the land question among smallholder farmers. Access to land via agricultural production is one of the important factors that can translate growth to poverty reduction. For agricultural based strategies to be pro-poor in Malawi, land redistribution or resettlement programme for the landless or near landless should be central and a pre-condition for  the effectiveness of pro-poor growth strategies in agriculture. The econometric results of the study show that access to land reduces the probability of being poor; prevents the poor from falling into poverty; and helps the non-poor to remain non-poor. Since customary land is not marketable, the link between access to land and poverty is via the growth in agricultural production. Pro-poor growth strategies in agriculture are likely to be ineffective in reducing poverty unless land reform is taken as a basic precondition of other pro-poor agricultural strategies in the Malawian PRSP. Opportunities for land reforms, particularly those that can increase access to land for the landless or near landless, do exist with the resulting poor performance of estate agriculture. The problem of ethnicity in estate ownership is less relevant in Malawi, and some estates have been abandoned and other estate owners are offering their estates for sale. In addition, there is high willingness among smallholder farmers to participate in a community based rural land development programme. However, government has been slow in taking advantage of these opportunities due to resource constraints, the donor dependence of the land reform programme and the low priority accorded to land reform in the poverty reduction strategies. When funds do become available to implement a land redistribution programme it will be important to ensure that the process of beneficiary selection is clear and transparent, embracing the active participation of communities and that the programme need to place the whole rural development context into perspective both in the resettlement and emigration areas.  Ensuring that land redistribution is accompanied by complementary policies (such as promotion of land use, extension services, easing the credit and capital constraints and basic infrastructure that is conducive to agricultural  development) are also critical. Land reform is currently ranked a seventh strategy in the current MPRS, yet adequate land is a basic resource for any viable agricultural strategy. Arguably, agricultural based pro-poor strategies without addressing the question of access to land in Malawi will be as ineffective as they have been in the past four decades. The paper recommends that, as Malawi reviews her poverty reduction strategies, land reform should be the first ranked strategy for the agricultural sector to generate pro-poor growth.

eldis:A61852;Forests and Climate Change Adaptation in Asia;;This policy brief examines the role of forests for climate change adaptation in the region of Asia. It is organized into several sections. Firstly, anticipated changes to precipitation and temperature in Asia under a low and a high emissions scenario, between 2010 and 2039, are outlined. Following on from this, the key elements of Forest-Based Adaptation (FBA) are discussed and the current status of FBA in Asia is highlighted. Finally, recommendations aimed at moving forest-based adaptation forward are made. The following suggestions are made: FBA should be integrated into wider sustainable forest management, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) should include forestry, FBA should be built into mitigation projects, FBA should be built into national development and conservation policies and links between forestry and non-forestry sectors should be acknowledged. ;;;;eldis;01/01/2012;en;"environment;climate change;land use;research";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"IDN;VNM;034;030;009";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A61852;http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/rap/files/NRE/Forests_and_climate_change_adaptation_in_Asia.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fao.org%2Ffileadmin%2Ftemplates%2Frap%2Ffiles%2FNRE%2FForests_and_climate_change_adaptation_in_Asia.pdf;;;;"author:The Centre for People and Forests (RECOFTC);Climate change Forestry;Climate change;Land use;REDD;CDKN;research;Environment;Climate Change Adaptation;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;Climate change agriculture and food security;tfmimport;Funder"
eldis:A26801;Dynamic carrying capacity analysis as a tool for conceptualising and planning range management improvements, with a case study from India;;The paper begins with a literature review of the basic theories which underpin range science. Two major approaches for determining carrying capacity (CC) are described, animal or plant oriented. The inherent problems with each approach are discussed in the light of a recent, wider debate, questioning the validity of CC as a range management tool.Methodological approaches for determination of CC, with inherent problems, are discussed. A brief description is given of a study from Rajasthan, India, illustrating seasonal changes in dry matter (DM) production from a complex mosaic of fodder resources. Utilization is also complex and dynamic, with fodder imports and exports being realized either directly or through animal movements.It is argued that despite its weaknesses, CC is a useful concept for planning range improvement projects. A redefined, dynamic CC is recommended, based on local technical knowledge. The authors conclude that until a more user-friendly alternative is presented, in a practical, rather than conceptual framework, CC will remain the best practical tool available to planners. They stress the need to fully involve range users (herders) in all aspects of project planning and implementation, if sustainable productivity increases are to be achieved.It is suggested that a flexible stocking rate (SR), dependent on seasonal and annual variation in feed availability, must be a key element in any improved range and livestock management strategy. Traditional herders probably already practice this strategy on intuitive information. ;"D. Hocking

eldis:A14392;The Batwa and the Hadzabe: an NCA-assessment;;This paper uses a human rights approach to look at the livelihoods of the Batwa of Rwanda and the Hadzabe of Tanzania. It looks at the problems related to the denial of their rights in areas of land, water, education and health care, and makes recommendations to NCA for further support.Findings include: Landlessness is a main problem Gaining education is critical for adults and children.  Mobile education is needed for the ‘mobile people’ of Hadzabe Income generation is essential. Tourist related work is a possibility for Hadzabe. Honey could be further developed for sale and create income for the hunters and gatherers Clean water and access to health facilities is a high priority. Shallow wells and bore holes for clean drinking water have been found successful in getting water to the people in the Valley Recommendations to NCA include: supporting the co-operation between the San-network of Southern Africa, the Batwa of Rwanda and the Hadzabe of Tanzania starting co-operating with CAURWA-Rwanda,  an  indigenous organization recognised by the Rwandan government. There is a need to strengthen CAURWA and their work related to literacy, capacity building, human rights and HIV/AIDS continuing to support the diocese of Byumba, Rwanda in a more participatory way. NCA should continue supporting job creation, farming and small-scale industries (ceramic/pottery) through the Anglican diocese of Byumba supporting water-development in Yaeda-Valley. Shallow wells and/or bore holes should be drilled in Yaeda Valley supporting health service in Yaeda Valley. The mobile clinics should be strengthened and made more efficient by installing mobile radios in the three villages of Yaeda supporting mobile education service related to Hadzabe supporting further demarcation of conservation areas applying a gender sensitive approach ;H.

eldis:A75466;Korean legislation on rural development and land reform ;;"The main objectives of this research report are to outline the various policies that have been implemented through statutes in the past, and to introduce the legislation regarding rural development and land reform. This report will document each economic turning point and each stage of development since Korea was liberated from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, to the present. This is all included in the “The Necessities and Objectives of Research” to provide substantial rationale for developing countries by linking policies with relevant Laws. In the meantime, whether such legislation and relevant policies have any positive outcome or side effects during this period, will be examined in the introduction to each relevant policy.

Documentation will provide invaluable analysis and data for developing countries. This research report is focused on finding relevant policies and outcomes that have affected Korea, in order for officials in developing countries, who are in charge of their respective country’s policies, to refer to for their own economic and developmental strategies in the future.

eldis:A69274;Securing rights, combating climate change: how strengthening community forest rights mitigates climate change;;"This report analyses evidence linking community forest rights with healthier forests and lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

It makes the case for strengthening the rights of indigenous and local communities over their forests as a policy tool for mitigating climate change. The report argues that when Indigenous Peoples and local communities have no or weak legal rights, their forests tend to be vulnerable to deforestation and thus become the source of carbon dioxide emissions. Legal forest rights for communities and government protection of their rights tend to lower carbon dioxide emissions and deforestation. Indigenous Peoples and local communities with legal forest rights maintain or improve their forests’ carbon storage. Even when communities have legal rights to their forest, government actions that weaken those rights can lead to high carbon dioxide emissions and deforestation. It argues that communities can partially overcome government actions that weaken their forest rights.

eldis:A21714;Natural resource management in the Didinga hills: a baseline study from Budi county, South Sudan;;Environmental degradation arising from the depletion of forest biodiversity and the resulting problems of soil erosion, water shortage, climate change and poverty, have become issues of global concern. Areas such as Buda county in South Sudan are subject to political instability and socio-cultural practices which have exacerbated environmental degradation problems.This study, assessing the extent and causes of the natural resource management (NRM) problems of the area, aimed to document accurate baseline data that could pave the way for developing management strategies that are locally appropriate and acceptable to foster sustainable natural resource management.Participatory data collection tools were used, including interviews and group discussions with local community leaders and farmers. The paper finds that:there are severe environmental degradation problems in Budi caused by deforestation, poor NRM, soil erosion and overgrazingthe causes of these problems are the prolonged civil war in South Sudan and the cattle raiding culture which has forced people to settle and cultivate in the steep slopes of the hills for security reasonsfarmers in the study area had not realized the scope of NRM and environmental problems in their areas - they have not put much effort in NRM and particularly in tree planting, soil and water management.

eldis:A21622;Adverse impacts of climate change on development of Bhutan: integrating adaptation into policies and activities;;Bhutan is a mountainous landlocked country with a varying climate and rich biodiversity.  Despite significant economic progress being made over recent years Bhutan remains a least developed nation with constraints and vulnerabilities adversely affecting its capacity to cope with climate change.The authors recognise that Bhutan’s vulnerability is heightened by low economic strength, inadequate infrastructure, lack of institutional capacity and an agro-based rural economy.  Impacts of climate change will have significant implications for the overall development of Bhutan.  Six major areas have been considered as most vulnerable to the effects of climate change: forests and biodiversity, agriculture, water resources, glacial lake outbursts, health and landslides.  It has also been found that a temperature increase of just 2°C would shift the cultivation zone to higher elevations, but land at this altitude is steep and therefore unsuitable for agriculture.National communication has highlighted measures likely to increase both development and the capacity to adapt to climate change, and reduce vulnerability:Land use planning: promotion of afforestation in degraded areasCommunity involvement:  developing awareness of more sustainable water resource usageAlternative crop development: utilising more resilient varieties for extreme temperatures and limited landCommunity based forest management: promoting the proper use of ecosystems including land and water conservation.The authors identify areas for further research including development of a more sustainable socio-economic system and development of more resistant tree species.  In addition to this, Bhutan has initiated the preparation of its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) which will simultaneously address climate change impacts and sustainable development. ;"M.

The authors examine the intervention strategies, methods and tools employed by different actors, as well as the underlying interests and assessment of options in conflict management and resolution.The collection covers cases involving conflicts and conflict management processes in a wide range of sectoral, ecological and regional settings, including  conflicts between urban and rural residents over the management of watersheds, between large- and small-scale agricultural producers over land, between members of different communities over use of forests, and between villagers and state officials over access to, and use of, protected areas. The case studies are taken from Africa, Asia and the Americas.The studies deal with a number of strategies, methods and tools used in natural resource conflict management and resolution, including indigenous/local practices, legal systems and alternative conflict management approaches.  Although the focus is on community-based natural resource management regimes, the case studies themselves often involve a wide variety of interested parties or actors, including governments, corporations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and technical assistance agencies.The articles included in the collection are:Community-based natural resource conflict management: the case of watershed planning in Metro Cebu, the PhilippinesConflict resolution in the Namanve Peri-Urban Reforestation Project in UgandaConflict management over contested natural resources: a case study of pasture, forest and irrigation in South Wello, EthiopiaConflicts over community-based “Repong” resource management in Pesisir Krui Region, Lampung Province, IndonesiaFrom conflict to co-management: the case of the Blue ForestContesting rights to forest land in ChinaForest user conflict management in The GambiaBeyond conflict in Clayoquot Sound: the future of sustainable forestryManaging conflict around contested natural resources: a case study of Rusitu Valley area, Chimanimani, ZimbabweResearch as mediation: linking participatory action research to environmental conflict management in East Nusa Tenggara, IndonesiaNatural resource conflict management: the case of Bwindi Impenetrable and Mgahinga Gorilla National Parks, Southwestern UgandaMoving from open access extraction to new participatory levels of accountable management Malampaya Sound, Palawan, the Philippines ;"A.

eldis:A102589;Political settlements, the mining industry and corporate social responsibility in developing countries;;In this paper the author takes a ‘political settlements’ approach to examining the political effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developing countries. The political settlements approach uses an integrated understanding of politics, power and institutional forms to explain how, given different political processes and incentives, the same institutional forms can produce different economic and developmental outcomes. The author applies this lens to the CSR practices of large mining companies in developing countries, examining their impacts on local and national political settlements using the Zambian metals mining sector as a case study. Directly, CSR features little in the national debate on natural resource governance in Zambia but local CSR activity is considerable.The author finds that the CSR practices of large metals mining companies influence the governance of extraction and the possibility of inclusive development with notable consequences for institutions of traditional leadership. The resulting pattern of inclusion and development is argued to result from the interaction of two processes - elite bargaining and coalitions within exclusionary political settlements on the one hand, and CSR practices shaped by risk management on the other. The author concludes by arguing that political settlements literature offers a rich seam for future research in the extractive sector if its limitations are addressed. ;T.

eldis:A19754;Land reform and its impact on livelihoods: evidence from eight land reform groups in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa;;One of the key objectives of the South African land reform programme is to provide poor people with an additional asset that they could use to develop strategies to escape from poverty. Although land ownership patterns have begun to change, there is little evidence to show how land reform beneficiaries are using their land and whether it is making a significant impact on poverty reduction.This report is based on a study examining the assets, activities and income sources of a random sample of households chosen from eight land reform groups, looking at changes between 2001 and 2003. The findings showed that the majority of households in the sample had limited asset holdings, and were involved in a narrow range of activities. In general the poorer households were highly dependent upon public transfers, in particular old age pensions and disability allowances.The rich, who had larger asset holdings, avoided poverty by successfully accessing the labour market. While most households had increased their livestock holdings, there was little evidence to demonstrate that they were making agriculture a more significant part of their livelihoods. Moreover, income derived from their land was a small proportion of total household income.The context is characterised by low levels of technical and managerial support from the government, dry climatic conditions in the region, and the competitive nature of South Africa’s agricultural market. As a result, the decision by households to treat agriculture as only a minor component of their livelihood strategy is a rational one. These circumstances mean the land reform programme will be unable to make a significant impact on poverty reduction. Consequently, there is a need for organisations with practical experience of the land reform programme to advocate for change.[adapted from author] ;A.

eldis:A38021;Approaches to rural poverty alleviation in developing Asia: role of water resources;;"Focusing on water resources and irrigation, this paper documents a talk by Michael Lipton exploring approaches to poverty alleviation in developing Asia. The talk discusses the findings of a recent paper ‘Pro-poor intervention strategies in irrigated agriculture in Asia: poverty in irrigated agriculture - realities, issues, and options with guidelines’. It looks at a number of topical issues such as irrigation in relation to access and global poverty, irrigation corruption, and sustainability. 
The study discussed rests upon household surveys in 2001-2 in 26 major and medium canal irrigation systems (and adjoining rainfed areas) in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. The surveys showed that in the rainfed areas, crop yields are typically half those in the adjoining irrigated areas, and that the landless in irrigated areas enjoy ‘much higher’ wage-rates and employment. Hence typically ‘poverty incidence is 20-30 per cent higher in rainfed than adjoining canal-irrigated settings. 
The speaker notes, however, that there are big differences, among and within systems, in irrigation’s efficiency, equity, and thus poverty impact. He asks, what determines the cost-effectiveness of irrigation as a sustainable remedy for poverty (a) in irrigated areas, (b) by spreading to new areas? 
Key points include: 

    whether management of water for farming is pro-poor depends on its sustainable impact on growth, stability and distribution of consumption, and of other indicators of well-being 
    the study gives strong evidence that more equal distribution of land and irrigation is not only pro-poor but also efficient 
    changes in incentives and institutions alone can bring rapid progress in solving most major problems of Asian canal irrigation, improving its economic efficiency and poverty impact 
    the main disincentive for aid to irrigation has been the growing doubt about side-effects: on health, on uncompensated land loss from new works (especially among indigenous populations), and on environmental sustainability 
    we need to look at the results of this project to examine the causes of collapse in irrigation investment, and about cost-effective, pro-poor ways to remedy that collapse

eldis:A14092;Governing the grasslands of Western China;;The paper begins by outlining Chinese grassland policy in the reform period and then describes key aspects of actual local level arrangements for grassland management. This description is based on the authors’ field studies at different sites on the Tibetan plateau (within Sichuan and Yunnan Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region) and Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Region1. A considerable difference between grassland policy and local-level arrangements is found, and the next section justifies these arrangements in terms of the social, ecological and economic context. The case is put that although the existing forms of community based management are not without problems, institutional change should be based on their  improvement, and the results of a pilot programme in Gansu Province is used to illustrate this. Finally, recent developments in the legislative framework for grassland tenure are examined.The paper concludes that given the social and ecological context of pastoralism in western China, the continuation of collective and group tenure arrangements and, more broadly, community-based management, is appropriate. However key aspects of grassland policy in the reform period that have not been consistent with this context have failed to be implemented on the ground. The  introduction of new land related laws and revision of old ones, offers an opportunity to afford de facto institutional arrangements greater formal legitimacy. Whether this is seized remains to be seen. The best possible outcome is if reforms provide local space for institutional innovation, thus potentially enabling institutional change in a direction that preserves the benefits, and addresses the problems, of existing arrangements.[adapted from authors] ;"T.

eldis:A22735;Transboundary water cooperation as a tool for conflict prevention;;This paper examines the role of trans-boundary water resource management and cooperation as a tool for preventing broader conflict. It argues that some factors regarding potential contributions to the development of trans-boundary basins have received insufficient attention. These include: intra-sectoral water use efficency including improved methods of irrigation, the selection of more appropriate crops, and the development and use of higher yield cropsinter-sectoral allocative efficiencies. Industrial applications may generate greater value added value for a given unit of water than agriculture basin states should consider virtual water flowsjoint water management and trans-boundary institutions are desirable. These are also closely linked to matters of sovereignty and jurisdictional competence sovereignty-related issues play an important role in determining the allocation of trans-boundary water resources and in the benefit-sharing scenario amongst basin states. The paper concludes that some implications for financing organisations that arise from the study include:water issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency, as the stress on water continues to rise with the rapidly expanding population growth further developments of trans-border water policies are needed, paying attention to funding and assistance to the water sector, while also linking water issues to other sectors and to poverty alleviation decisions on major infrastructure developments and on water management practices as a whole, should apply a holistic vision, extending beyond the Integrated Water Resource Management in cases where there is a basin hegemon, external funding entities should be prepared to offer impartial advice in an attempt to maximize the likelihood of an equitable outcome while there is potential for spill-over in both directions between cooperation on trans-boundary water management and broader international cooperation, all solutions are unique to each given trans-boundary basin, and each set of co-raparians.  ;"A.

In reviewing  Farm Worker Equity Share (FWES) schemes  the authors recommend a combination of institutional practices that can be used to enhance Farm Worker Equity Share schemes; some of these include:operating the scheme like a company with voting and benefit rights tradable and proportional to individual investment.not diluting workers’ interests through transferring of shares to non-workers as a result of bequests or sales to outsiders.Involving workers in the design of the FWES and its operating rules.

eldis:A13573;Natural resources, development models and sustainable development;;This paper starts from the optimistic assumption that the policies required for environmentally sustainable economic development are known but difficulties surround their implementation. The paper argues that in the low-income countries differences in the natural resource endowment are an important and hitherto neglected cause of tardy environmental policy improvements. This is because the primary sector remains large relative to GDP in such countries so that the scale and socio-economic linkages generated by the natural resource rents condition the aims of governments in important ways.Most developing countries are resource-rich and natural resource abundance tends to foster predatory political states that use the rents to relax market discipline and buy political support, distorting their economies in the process so that competitive economic diversification falters and growth collapses. Recovery is protracted and may take generations to accomplish. Meanwhile, macro policy failure damages micro policies, including those aimed at environmental improvement, by distorting prices and incentives, depressing genuine saving rates and shortening time horizons to secure immediate survival.The author concludes that environmental policy makers and their advisers can benefit from a fuller awareness of how macro policy failure adversely impacts on environmental policies. They need to adapt environmental policies to the macroeconomic limitations and to recognise that some past policies may have failed because of those limitations rather than through systemic flaws in the policies themselves. He argues that they also need to be more supportive of the efforts of the IFIs to ease the constraint of maladroit macroeconomic management. The strengthening of sanctions against anti-social governance can help here. This will improve the design of sound environmental policies guided by total economic value to price in externalities, green accounting to achieve positive genuine saving, and cost-effective pollution abatement measures. In this way, developing countries can leapfrog the environmental learning curve of the advanced economies and limit the mismanagement of natural resources and minimise the damage to environmental services.

eldis:A65403;Nationally appropriate mitigation actions for grassland and livestock management in Mongolia;;"This policy brief by the Asian Development Bank argues that, given the negative impact of climate change on Mongolia, it is crucial to select mitigation actions that reduce vulnerability to climate change, support the achievement of national development goals, and are feasible given local constraints.

Key messages from the brief include:

• Mongolia’s total emissions are low, but its emissions per capita are relatively high and rising and are produced primarily by the energy and agriculture sectors.

• Nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) can help provide access to international financing.

• Mongolia’s NAMA for the management of its grassland and livestock sectors should be based on its National Livestock Program.

• Implementation of Mongolia’s NAMAs should be phased, with three categories of activities — quick wins, fast-tracked actions, and key medium-term actions.

• Mongolia needs to develop a credible measurement, reporting, and verification system, and strengthen institutional capacity.

eldis:A35119;Water tenure reform and public access to water as a basic need;;"Access to water is a widely debated topic as water scarcity is looming large before several developing countries. The traditional approach of water as a public good is giving way to reforms which consider water as an economic good. This paper critically reviews legal and policy issues around the changing approach to appropriation and access to water. It identifies two major trends in reforms in water governance:

    water as a collective heritage of people not subject to ownership rights except where law recognises user rights and appropriation rights
    privatisation of water resources and management, with active encouragement by the World Bank. 

To elaborate on these two opposing, the paper presents case studies of water governance reforms in Quebec and Bolivia. While the reforms in Quebec have taken the rights approach to water, Bolivia has resorted to privatisation. Based on the lessons learned from these reforms, the paper argues that both these approaches are problematic. The collective ownership approach does recognise people’s right to water in line with the declaration of UN Committee on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights. However, it does not solve the problems faced by developing countries - lack of resources to provide equal access to water, exacerbated by scarcity of water. The privatisation approach discriminates against the poor as they cannot afford the high tariffs which are invariably associated with privatisation. The privatisation approach thus breaches the principles of equality, equal access and affordability. The paper concludes that two trends do not have to be mutually exclusive or contradictory. Recognition of water as a human right accords states with specific obligations with regard to its implementation. The states can then involve the private sector in giving effect to its obligation. However, the state must ensure that right to water is guaranteed on the basis of non-discrimination and prevent third parties from interfering with this right. Policy options include: 

    national governments should enact legislation recognising water as a fundamental right and ensure its provision on the basis of equality and non-discrimination
    privatisation need not be a closed option as long as decisions to do so are taken with the participation of the people to be potentially affected

eldis:A16179;Rural poverty, property rights and environmental resource management in Kenya;;This study investigates the relationship between rural poverty, property rights, and environmental resource management in a semi-arid region of Kenya using analysis of survey data. It argues that reduced environmental degradation will increase agricultural productivity, and which will then translate into lower levels of poverty as incomes and consumption expenditures rise. It also suggests that environmental quality, productivity and poverty are unaffected by property right regimes.Implications from this study include:poverty is associated with higher levels of environmental degradationwell specified property rights are associated with higher productivity and lower povertyenvironmental conservation is an important mechanism for escaping poverty.Summarily, the study recommends that:there is a need to speed up privatisation of the remaining group ranches so that the community can enjoy the benefits of private property. Failing that then the existing common rights systems ought to be enhanced in-order to boost productivity and reduce povertyenvironmental conservation and preservation of biomass be encouraged in-order to improve productivity and reduce povertythere is a need to address factors governing the link between poverty, environmental conservation and productivity, especially development of markets, infrastructure and reduced family size.[author] ;J.

eldis:A13930;Land reform, poverty reduction and HIV/AIDS;;"The paper offers proposals for integrating understanding of and response to the pandemic into land reform-related development activities.  The paper argues that in order to do so, policy-makers need to understand the overall pandemic, learn about how AIDS affects both the people whom land reform is intended to benefit and the people staffing the institutions that support land reform, and then change their understanding of how to go about it.The paper states that it is important to be aware that:more heavily affected families may become ‘invisible’ to development practitioners and that care should therefore be taken to actively seek out these groupsinstitutions that plan and implement land reform are staffed by people who may be infected and affected by HIV/AIDS and argues that care should therefore be taken to understand how this will affect organisational capacity to plan and deliver reformDrawing on the ‘sustainable livelihoods’ approach, the paper maps the affects of HIV/AIDS on human, financial, physical, social and natural capital, and finds the following implications for land reform:families badly hit by HIV/AIDS are likely to be excluded from the land reform process15 to 35% of adults who could benefit from land reform are currently HIV positive, and they will begin to fall ill with chronic illness leading to death in the next five to ten yearsmany other adults being resettled, and many of their children, will in the future become HIV positive and go on to develop AIDSIt argues that planners in the land reform process should recognise these implications and seek to achieve objectives involving a range of complimentary services in order to:maximise appropriate access, with attention to the particular needs of those infected and affected by HIV and AIDSsupport productive use in the long term, including those affected and infected by HIV and AIDSminimise HIV transmission and improve care and treatment for those who are ill, through the provision of essential servicesThe article concludes with a number of proposals for organisations working in development:learn about HIV/AIDS in more depth, perhaps getting a trained counsellor to meet all staff to help them understand HIV/AIDS and the implications this has for them personally and for their workunderstand the epidemic in the area where the organisation operates: how are local people and institutions affected, what are future trends, how are people responding, what are obvious gaps, and what are the strengths that may be built upon?review or design an internal workplace policy on HIV and AIDS, which ensures that all staff are aware of the facts; have access to information; can get confidential counselling and testing; and that anyone who is ill gets the needed support.  The SADC Code of Conduct on HIV/AIDS and Employment, and national labour laws are starting pointsreview current programmes or plans for land reform or other poverty reduction strategies with two questions in mindhow is HIV/AIDS affecting the issues related to the organisation’s work, and how will it affect the situation in ten years’ time?how could the organisation’s activities increase or decrease the transmission of HIV? Is the organisation cutting out families already badly affected by HIV/AIDS? How relevant it the organisation’s work to families who have one or more HIV-positive member, or who will develop AIDS in future?carry out an internal vulnerability audit to understand how the organisation might be affected by HIV/AIDS in the future, in particular in the areas of human resources, productivity, and finances[from the author] ";D.

eldis:A68101;Land and conflict in Sierra Leone: a rapid desk-based study ;;"This paper is a desk-based study of land rights and conflict in Sierra Leone.  It reviews post-2002 academic and grey literature. It addresses land ownership and rights within Sierra Leone, as well as exploring the concept of land ownership as a source or driver of conflict. It also reviews literature on the current land tenure system, and government stated policies.

Academic literature suggests that power dynamics have changed in rural areas since the war, but Paramount Chiefs and elders of landowning family lineages still hold more power over local land allocation than locally elected councils. Chiefs have traditionally controlled access to land by individuals of lower social status such as outsiders, women and young men. There is some indication that inter-generational relations and relations between weaker groups and chiefs have improved in recent years.

Among anecdotal sources, there is a significant perception of ‘land grabbing’ by foreign companies involved in large bio-fuel and other projects, which cannot be easily verified due to lack of accurate land use records or research. Anecdotally, NGOs, civil society and human rights groups have documented outbreaks of violence in response to such projects.

Further evidence is required to draw firm conclusions on both foreign and domestic investment in terms of their impact on access to land and their role in sparking land disputes or violent conflict. NGOs are calling for greater transparency in land deals and informed consent, which could help to mitigate the risk of conflict.

eldis:A73011;Na Ot village case study: Land tenure and resource rights;;"This case study examines eight equity dimensions in sustainable forest management through the case study of Na Ot Village, Na Ot Commune, Mai Son District, Son La province in Viet Nam.

It highlights that securing forest tenure and resource rights is a critical cornerstone and a first prerequisite for promoting community forestry through mobilising local communities to manage and benefit from forest sustainably, to participate in the democratic decision-making process, and establish their own customary practices of forest management in Viet Nam.

It argues that giving forest tenure to local community should take a customary community forestry law in the area into account, thereby retaining the flexibility and capacity to adapt that often gives these systems their power.

Transferring tenure rights and management responsibilities to local communities should be not seen as simply allowing communities increased access to the forest resource, but as a process of power sharing and capacity building.

eldis:A100668;Traditional livelihoods and mining in Mongolia's changing climate: exploring the potential of cross-sectoral partnerships in achieving sustainability ;;"The growing scale of resource development activities accentuates the complexity underlying the sustainability of traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. At the same time, Mongolia experiences growing vulnerability to climatic variability and change, expressed in the form of intense desertification, water stress, and extreme dzuds. This paper is based on APN-funded capacity building workshops that focused on understanding a) how climatic changes impact herding and mining—although in varied forms, and b) how each sector may leverage its resources to devise action, strategies and tools that may help build capacities and boost resilience towards changing climatic conditions. Workshop discussions highlighted that traditional livelihoods remain under multiple threats from climatic variability and change; and institutionalised mechanisms of creating cross-sectoral partnerships - such as a network hub of key stakeholder groups - is fundamental in ensuring climate-resilient coexistence between mining and herding sectors.Highlights:this project was a first of its kind to discuss the complex links between livelihoods, the mining sector and climate change and natural disasters in Mongoliaa key focus of the project was brainstorming the idea of establishing a network hub of key actors that would value the strengths of individual sector groups and allow partnerships by identifying issues of common concerna clear highlight of the project is the greater appreciation of traditional herding knowledge and its indispensable role in natural disaster management and reliefmining industry in Mongolia is open to discussion centred around climate change and discussing its future implications on the sector. This is particularly noteworthy in light of a more reserved take on global warming internationally across the sectorAs a result of the finding of this study, policy recommendations are presented for five key areas:green development: the significance of green development at the local level is fundamental to guide changes in behaviour across Mongolia with regard to climate change, disaster management and resilience building. Workshop participants strongly advocated for stakeholder involvement in the development of a climate change policy framework at the local leveldisaster management: central government needs to build a better knowledge base on what forms a disaster, and disaster management and prevention plans, both for pre- and post-disasters. Investment in terms of obtaining best practices from national and international sources may help the process with better managing and addressing disastersmining and impacts of climate change: the mining sector in Mongolia is open to discussing potential impacts of climate change, climate variability and natural disasters on the mining sector. The sector is willing to embrace action to address climatic perturbations as there is an acceptance of a strong business case for the mining industry to take note of changing environmental conditions across Mongoliagreater recognition of traditional herding knowledge: Mongolia should further invest in studies that reaffirm the importance of herder movement, and its role in disaster management and maintaining pasture quality. Additionally, a systematic policy refocus to move attention from herd quantity to quality is essential in the country’s current policy landscape. Improved government funding may allow studies on genetic herd improvements and the importance of focusing on a balance herd compositionknowledge hub: an established avenue for stakeholder groups to come together, discuss common concerns, debate options and identify pathways forward is vital to Mongolia’s future sustainability. Until such time when legislative requirements call for cross-sectoral cooperation, a knowledge hub may help institutionalise the practice of nudging sectors that may have been in conflict thus far to cooperate and use consensus—not conflict—to ascertain solutions to common challenges ";;;Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research;eldis;01/01/2016;en;"environment;climate change;mining;natural disasters";Land, Climate change & Environment;;MNG;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A100668;http://www.apn-gcr.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CAF2014-CD04NSY-Sharma.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apn-gcr.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FCAF2014-CD04NSY-Sharma.pdf;;;;"Environment;Mining;Climate Change Adaptation;Environment and natural resource management;Climate change;natural disasters;Agriculture and food;climate change adaptation disaster risk reduction;public-private partnership;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;Pastoralism;traditional livelihoods"
eldis:A13932;Seeking ways out of the impasse on land reform in Southern Africa: notes from an informal ‘think tank’ meeting;;Land reform in Southern Africa is currently at an impasse.  This paper analyses the constraints to sustainable land reform and identifies ways and means of moving things forward.  In addition, appendices to the document include country by country reviews of the status of land reform in each country, and a matrix providing an overview of current land issues in the region.The document finds that whilst some progress has been achieved with tenure reform in Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique, many challenges remain across the region, particularly for Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia.  The paper finds that the following issues need to be understood and addressed:Cyclical patterns of land reform in the region:initial strong political commitment to land redistribution often gives way to an emphasis on ‘economic’ goals rather than the eradication of poverty, which tends to favour elite landowners rather than the landless lobby.Redistributive land reform:in the context of the region, and in particular South Africa, the following need to be addressed:balancing redistribution with sustainable rural developmentthe productivity of small farmersestablishing post-transfer support (farm credit, extension services) in complex institutional contextshigh rural to urban migrationmobilisation for change amongst civil society and businessthe possibility of dropping the ‘willing buyer, willing seller’ approachLand tenure reform:is a crucial issue as it may assure the land rights of the majority of the population, because of the potential link between secure land rights, investment and economic growth, and because it is an important safeguard against creating land or income inequality in the future.Land rights of women:across the region, women suffer from strong male bias in relation to land rights. Despite pockets of success (for example Botswana), there is insufficient attention to mainstreaming gender concerns into land policy and implementation. This applies not only to governments and public and customary institutions, but also to many donor and NGO programmes.Customary land rights and systems:initiatives to protect customary land rights alongside formal rights in polarised and racially divided contexts such as Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia can benefit from looking at the experiences of lower profile countries of Botswana, Mozambique and Malawi.  Emphasis should be placed upon the process (who is involved in the policy discussions and subsequent implementation) as much as the technical content and substance of the resulting programme.HIV/AIDS and land:the potentially catastrophic impact of HIV/AIDS requires a re-examination of many basic assumptions underpinning land policy work.  The pandemic is bringing the negative impact of aspects of customary law on the livelihoods of women and children into sharper focus, as their land rights become more vulnerable to dispossession by patrilineal kin on the death of male household heads. More attention needs to be paid to understanding the impact of HIV/AIDS on land tenure.Donor support to government land reform programmes is increasingly politically sensitive for both donors and recipient governments. However, donors should continue to support a redistribution agenda, which should be a long-term iterative process, requiring feedback, learning and involvement of many stakeholders.Donor support to civil society initiativesshould be further encouraged, for example through a ‘Land Reform Fund’. Civil society organisations are a source of knowledge and information, are effective partners in implementing land reform, and can also be important in kick-starting new government initiatives. ;;;Oxfam;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"land;land tenure;land rights;customary land rights;land reform;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A13932;http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/livelihoods/landrights/downloads/impassertf.rtf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfam.org.uk%2Fwhat_we_do%2Fissues%2Flivelihoods%2Flandrights%2Fdownloads%2Fimpassertf.rtf;;;;"HIV and AIDS treatment and care;EADI;gender;HIV and AIDS;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;southern africa;land rights;Hiv/Aids;land redistribution;customary land rights;rural;gender mainstreaming;land reform;Malawi;women"
eldis:A69768;Small-scale Private Rental in South Africa;;"Small-scale private rental is an international phenomenon, and is not unique to South Africa. This sub-sector is generally one of the most successful, efficient and pervasive accommodation delivery systems in South Africa. Of the 2.4-million South African households that rent their primary accommodation, 850 000 (35%) occupy small-scale private rental units. This equates to approximately 10% of all South African households.

This study examines the small-scale private rental sub-sector and its potential to deliver housing in South Africa. The research describes this sub-sector as a housing delivery system that is based on contracts between landlords and tenants, and exists on privately held land. It presents a continuum from single room, affordable-for-low-income-group options to the ‘granny flat’ options more commonly found in the suburbs.

There are various reasons why small-scale private rental should be considered a viable option within South Africa’s human settlements strategy and programmes. These include the following:

• there is a significant demand for housing from single people to small family units for whom the standard Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) solution (i.e. low-cost, subsidised housing to buy) is not appropriate;

• many people have sufficient disposable income to afford low-end rentals offered privately;

• in most residential areas (whether suburbs or townships) infrastructure already exists, so additional small-scale private rental in these areas is not a significant cost to the state;

• accommodation within existing residential areas gives many locational advantages (e.g. access, transport or amenities).

Various barriers to more effective delivery of housing by this sub-sector like, perceptions that it promotes ‘slums’, and various current policy and delivery failings or gaps are also examined in the study.

Finally, the study recommends that new policy is required that enables the small-scale private rental sub-sector to deliver housing as an integral part of the state’s human settlements strategy and programmes.

eldis:A8733;This land is your land.  Rights and rural livelihoods in Southern Africa;;Tenure reform aims to secure people's land rights. In Southern Africa most so-called 'communal' land, reserved for Africans, is still held by the state. In these areas, land rights are increasingly insecure. Yet, the confirmation of the rights of those who have long occupied and used the land lags behind programmes that aim to transfer white-held land to Africans. Many colonial and apartheid land laws are still in force, particularly those relating to chiefs, who resist any reduction to their power. Past colonial governments herded people into over-crowded reserves: to confirm the rights of the in- comers would be to cement injustice. ;Martin Adams;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"land;land tenure;land rights;common property;land reform;agriculture";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"SWZ;ZAF;LSO;ZWE;202;NAM";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A8733;http://www.id21.org/society/1bld2.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fsociety%2F1bld2.html;;;;"colonialism;southern africa;Communal land;land redistribution;land tenure;Access;sustainability;land rights;agriculture Botswana;Livelihoods;Land tenure;common property;land reform;agriculture;Agriculture and food"

eldis:A68263;Land deal brief: Tanzanian villagers pay for sun biofuels investment Disaster;;"The Tanzanian government has put agriculture at the forefront of its development agenda through its “kilimo kwanza” (agriculture first) initiative, which was established in 2009. For a country like Tanzania, which is gifted with a rich diversity of natural and human resources and has a population that is still largely rural, investment in agriculture can offer considerable development potential. 

In recent years, the production of agrofuels by foreign energy companies has been a growing area of agricultural investment in the country. Although proponents of this trend argue that it will bring much-needed agricultural investment to a country where the majority of the population is engaged in agriculture, others are concerned that large-scale agrofuel production, coupled with insecure land rights and weak land governance, is actually fuelling exclusion of rural households from their land.

eldis:A20308;Supporting land reform in South Africa: participatory planning experience in the Northern Cape Province;;This paper documents a participatory approach for supporting black South Africans in developing knowledge and skills to use land, acquired under the land reform scheme, more effectively. This approach enables land reform groups to work jointly through a sequence of steps in order to develop and implement a land management plan.The participatory planning method can be summarised into four main stages. First, the land reform group seeks to understand how the agricultural sector operates in its area, and identifies those agencies that provide technical and managerial support. Next, practical research is undertaken to provide information on the livelihoods of the group members, the various objectives of the group and the agricultural potential of the land. A committee develops a realistic management plan to pursue the objectives, taking account of the resource constraints. Finally, once the group as a whole has taken collective ownership of the plan, implementation starts, and the necessary technical and financial inputs must be secured. Finally, the outcomes of the plan will be monitored and evaluated against indicators generated and agreed by the group. The paper notes, however, that there is a lack of people with the required facilitation skills, which must be addressed.Two key lessons learned from this experience are:for the land reform programme to succeed, it is crucial that beneficiaries participate in preparing a realistic plan for their farms, of which the land reform group as a whole takes ownershipenough time must be allowed for the participatory planning process, with the time required in each case varying depending on the complexity of the group, the size of the farm and the range of group members’ objectives ;A.

eldis:A20718;Winning the water wars: toward a watershed-based approach to watershed resources management: a policy agenda for local government units;;"Water governance in the Philippines is saddled by several problems. The failure to implement laws governing the watershed approach and the absence of institutional mechanisms has seriously undermined any effort to mainstream and integrate water and watershed plans and programmes into the activities of various agencies involved in water resources management and governance. This is compounded by the lack of appreciation of water as an economic good, which leads to the inability for market-based mechanisms to function.In this paper, the author argues the need to obtain wide support vis-à-vis the Local Government Units (LGUs) and civil society organisations in water management since local communities are directly involved and are usually the frontline consumers of environmental goods. The author believes that it is in the best interest of these local communities to be directly involved in how the water resources should be managed and receive the proper training to perform their role.The author offers the following as guiding principles in the involvement of LGUs in water resources management. LGU’s must:adopt an integrated and holistic approach in addressing the inherently interrelated issues of water supply planning and operation, demand management, pollution control, and watershed and ground water protectionmanage water not only as a social good but also more importantly as an economic goodimplement a strategy to operationalise a water-pricing policy that covers the full economic cost of water production and distribution, by taking into account the opportunity cost of water where there are competing users, and the cost of externalities or negative environmental impactsuphold the principles associated with a watershed-based approach by considering the watershed as the basic unit in managing the water resources of the country.The author also suggests that there is a need for mechanisms to enable LGUs to be effective managers of their water resources to:support for the institutionalisation of local water bodiescreate a technical capacity and awareness among the LGUs and local communities, particularly in managing watershedenable the financial viability and sustainability of local initiatives beyond their reliance on official development assistance.The author concludes the study by indicating that there is a need to put in place mechanisms that require local governments to involve civil society organisations. LGUs may not always be efficient and responsive at all times; in fact there is a need for the presence of strong social capital, strong organisational capacity, high political literacy, and strong capacity for informed and effective advocacy.  Hence, civil society organisations could become effective technical partners of local government units in water resources governance. ";A.P.

eldis:A69767;Strategies to help poor people access urban land markets;;"City planners mostly agree that poor people need to be better located in cities to improve their access to social amenities and economic opportunities. Living, trading or producing goods on better located land also gives people access to markets, which improves the potential for sustainable poverty alleviation.

This vision has been at the heart of planning for cities in developing countries for decades. And yet it has not happened to any great extent, at least not in South Africa. The poor remain in poor locations and on low value land, disconnected from physical and market networks.

Urban land that would give poor people the means to create wealth is in high demand and thus sought after by the more powerful sectors of the economy. Given the ‘logic’ of the market, poorer communities, and state actors such as municipalities that act on their behalf, are often unable to bid competitively on valuable land. State interventions can distort the market in favour of poor people, but they are still vulnerable unless they are also using the land in ways which extract sufficient value. Low-income housing and small-scale production and trade are rarely profitable or intense enough to compete for good locations in market terms within the current predominant South African urban form. Therefore the development planning vision of equitable and integrated cities remains unrealised, not to mention the achievement of slum-free cities.

The paper looks at this conundrum in the South African context and suggests ways in which poor people can be spatially and economically integrated into cities by increasing their bidding power, including improving the intensity of land utilisation. These strategies include:

• providing access to suitable land;

• supporting higher intensity of land use;

• enabling local value capture on desirable land;

• promoting partnerships and associations;

• introducing pro-poor land access policies and incentives such as well-designed municipal rates systems.

Accordingly, achieving all of this will include, apart from a growing economy in which the benefits of growth reach all sectors of society, state action to manage land, creating enabling and efficient regulations and administrative systems, deepening land and property rights, improving tenure, directing infrastructure investment, and understanding markets while targeting spatial planning towards the needs of the poor.

eldis:A67310;Resource abundance in mozambique: avoiding conflict, ensuring prosperity;;"From as early as the 1960s companies have been exploring the natural resource wealth of Mozambique. However, it is only in the past decade that the potential of these resources has been realised. Indeed, Mozambique is now thought to have some of the largest deposits of gas and coal on the African continent, and beyond. The country is also one of Africa’s few post-conflict success stories and has experienced unprecedented positive economic growth since 1994, exceeding the growth of many of its peers across the continent. However, there are a number of very real concerns about how successfully the government will be able to govern its mineral resources. This is particularly relevant in the light of renewed political tensions between the Frelimo-led government and the official opposition, Renamo, that have been on the rise since early 2013.

This paper investigates the likelihood of violence as a result of natural resource abundance in the country. Specifically, by combining general typologies of conflict and more specific theories on natural resource abundance and conflict, this paper identifies six risk factors for conflict in Mozambique: its history of violence and political party dynamics; geographic distribution; poverty and inequality; expectations; corruption; and the cost of extraction.

In order to avoid conflict and ensure broad-based prosperity for the Mozambican population as a whole, the government will have to navigate carefully several complex issues in the governance of its natural resources. This paper examines these factors against the likelihood of violence and concludes that although there is a high likelihood of the emergence of pockets of violence, there are various efforts the government can make to avoid negative outcomes associated with the country’s resource abundance. Indeed, the task of translating its newfound mineral wealth into the development of the country itself while balancing local expectations and political tensions is a very large one that will require the establishment of clear and strong policies, institutions, legislation and regulatory frameworks.

eldis:A67066;On the margin: Kenya’s pastoralists. From displacement to solutions, a conceptual study on the internal displacement of pastoralists;;"Pastoralism is a global phenomenon. In Africa, where 66 per cent of is used for pastoral production, it is recognised as part of the continent’s cultural heritage. More than just a means of production, it is a way of life intrinsically linked to the identity of the individuals and communities that practise it. Given their traditionally nomadic lifestyle, the fact that pastoralists can become internally displaced is often overlooked. Some even question whether it can happen at all.
This study focuses on northern Kenya. It argues that their internal displacement is a reality that has to be understood within a broader discourse about mobility, and creates a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon by examining its multi-causality. In doing so, it also discusses processes and options for improving protection and assistance for those affected. Pastoralists’ internal displacement is presented as a process of impoverishment and decreasing resilience, which leads to the disenfranchisement of rights, marginalisation and neglect. As such, it is as much a human rights as a humanitarian and development concern that requires a holistic approach.

eldis:A72838;Valuing variability: new perspectives on climate resilient drylands development;;"This book is a challenge to those who see the drylands as naturally vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty. 

It argues that improving agricultural productivity in dryland environments is possible by working with climatic uncertainty rather than seeking to control it – a view that runs contrary to decade of development practice in arid and semi-arid lands.

Across China, Kenya and India – and most other dryland countries – family farmers and herders relate to the inherent variability of the drylands as a resource to be valued, rather than a problem to be avoided. 

By exploring these vibrant agricultural economies that take advantage of variability, this book inverts longstanding negative views about food security in the drylands.

eldis:A67063;Land Access and youth livelihood opportunities in Southern Ethiopia;;"This study aims to examine current land access and youth livelihood opportunities in Southern Ethiopia. Access to agricultural land is a constitutional right for rural residents of Ethiopia. We used survey data from the relatively land abundant districts of Oromia Region and from the land scarce districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ (SNNP) Region. We found that youth in the rural south have limited potential to obtain agricultural land that can be a basis for viable livelihood. The law prohibits the purchase and sale of land in Ethiopia. We found that land access through allocation from authorities is virtually nonexistent while land that can be obtained from parents through inheritance or gift is too small to establish a meaningful livelihood. The land rental market has restrictions, including on the number of years land can be rented out. Perhaps as a result of limited land access, the youth have turned their back on agriculture. Our study shows that only nine percent of youth in these rural areas plan to pursue farming. The majority are planning non-agricultural livelihoods. We also found a significant rural-urban migration among the youth and especially in areas with severe agricultural land scarcity. Our econometric analyses show that youth from families with larger land holding are less likely to choose non-agricultural livelihood as well as less likely to migrate to urban areas. We suggest here some measures to improve rural livelihood such as creation of non-farm employment opportunities and improvement of land rental markets. We also argue that as a certain level of rural-urban migration is unavoidable, investigating youth migration is essential to design policies that help the migrating youth as well as the host communities.

Wives' stated preferences for stronger land rights to women and husbands' stated preferences for the traditional weak position of women were significantly affecting the wives' degree of within-household involvement in land-related decisions in opposite directions. Within-household generosity as expressed in dictator game experiments between husbands and wives, was correlated with stronger involvement of wives in land-related decisions.

eldis:A67061;The roles of land tenure reforms and land markets in the context of population growth and land use intensification in Africa;;"This article provides a review of the past and potential future roles of land tenure reforms and land markets in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as responses to population growth in the process of land use intensification and livelihood transformation. The farm size distribution and the existence of an inverse relationship (IR) between farm size and land productivity in SSA and the implications of this relationship for efficiency and equity are investigated.More secure property rights and removal of restrictions on land markets have the potential to create both efficiency and equity benefits, but there are high risks of elite capture of large land areas with inefficient and inequitable outcomes. This situation is the case not only in land-abundant areas but also in urban and peri-urban areas where increasingly larger proportions of people will make their living. Increasing population pressure in densely populated rural areas contributes to more rapid rural–urban migration, and creating alternative livelihood opportuties for the migrating youth population is essential to achieving economic development with social stability.

eldis:A11772;Land reform and poverty alleviation: experiences from Namibia;;Redistributive land reform in Namibia is widely regarded as a precondition for sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation. This paper briefly discusses the development of thinking on land reform and the development of land reform models prior to Independence. It refers to progress on land redistribution since 1990 and discusses some of the problems experienced.A brief analysis of the history of the land question, socio-economic developments since Independence and future budget allocations leads to the conclusion that the pace of land reform is not likely to increase in the short to medium term. A few suggestions are made on how land reform can be supported. (author)The paper concludes that land reform in Namibia has progressed at a very slow pace. While a number of freehold farms have been purchased for resettlement, government has not been able to meet the demands of the poor and unemployed. Reform is not anticipated to play a major role in poverty alleviation.The author highlights how communities subsisting on non-freehold land are still waiting for appropriate legislation. It is suggested that the interests of those who have fenced off communal pastures are likely to stall attempts to implement meaningful tenure reform. The challenge remains to develop reform options that are sustainable in the long run, both socio-economically and environmentally. ;W.

eldis:A20533;Informal land delivery processes in African cities;;Informal systems for land delivery, which have in many cases evolved from earlier customary practices, still account for over half the land supplied for housing in African cities and are a particularly important channel for the poor. This study examines how informal systems of housing land delivery operate in six African cities discussing how they are evolving and how they interact with formal land administration systems. A series of working papers and policy briefings are presented based on studies of the following cities: Eldoret (Kenya), Enugu (Nigeria), Gaborone (Botswana), Kampala (Uganda), Lusaka (Zambia) and Maseru (Lesotho).The study finds that:formal land delivery systems provide only a limited supply of plots and are rarely accessible to poor peoplenon-customary informal land administration practices are often a direct response to the failures of the formal tenure and administration systemsin the past informal systems enabled all but the poorest people to access land for self-managed house construction. Today, non-commercial channels for obtaining land are restricted and access to land, therefore, is restricted mainly to middle and upper income households who can afford the purchase pricemost women members of indigenous groups only obtain access to land through men, but women with means can buy informally subdivided landinformal land delivery processes are often effective in delivering land for housing because they are accessible and socially legitimate. However, urban growth increases the pressure on existing social rules and practices used to regulate transactions and resolve disputes in land. Some have been able to adapt, often copying and borrowing from formal rules, but others have weakened and broken down.The research concludes that informal land delivery systems are playing a significant and effective role in urban residential land delivery and should continue to do so. However some shortcomings need to be addressed:tenure security:governments should provide short-term security to residents in informal settlements and, in the vast majority of cases, cease to evict settlers and demolish housesincreased tenure security will encourage investment in housingsecurity and formal land administration can be enhanced by public sector agencies accepting innovations emerging from informal systemspoor layouts and services:can be addressed by recognising such areas, paving the way for working with subdividers to improve layouts and enable the early provision of basic servicesregistering occupiers enables governments to generate tax revenues and charge users for servicesdecentralisation formal land administration should be decentralised, in particular to provide for local registration of land rights and transactionscompensation to deter informal subdivision, revised compensation provisions are needed, requiring government to pay adequate compensation when it expropriates land from private or customary rights holders. ;"C.

eldis:A61681;Do trees grow on money? The implications of deforestation research for policies to promote REDD;;"This paper provides a brief overview of the current knowledge and data on deforestation rates, research on the causes of deforestation and forest degradation and relevant policy options. It highlights issues of particular relevance to new discussions on reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries at different stages of forest transition. The paper suggests that the design and implementation of REDD policies will be neither simple nor straightforward, given the complexity of the social, economic, environmental and political dimensions of deforestation. The paper states that the causes of deforestation and degradation can be separated into direct and underlying causes. The direct causes include agricultural expansion, wood extraction and infrastructure extension. Many of the underlying causes are generated outside the forestry sector, these include demographic and macroeconomic factors, and technological, policy and cultural variables. The authors argue that the multi-dimensional factors that cause deforestation can differ significantly across countries and over time. Therefore, REDD policies need to deal with the fact that the institutions responsible for aligning the behaviour of individual economic actors are generally weak and interests of different stakeholders differ within and between countries.The paper gives the following recommendations.

    There is a need to eliminate subsidies that drive deforestation and degradation, such as subsidies for agricultural expansion.
    New incentives for forest protection must be created, including forest friendly subsidies, certification schemes and transfer payment schemes.
    Governance mechanisms need to be strengthened, such as tenure and property rights and inclusive participation in decision-making.
    Strengthening institutional capacity at national, regional and local levels is necessary to ensure that each is allocated appropriate responsibilities and resources.

eldis:A11847;Water management conflict and the challenges of globalisation notes;;As globalisation intensifies, what is the impact on the power of national governments to address water issues? The author notes how globalisation has reconfigured the state and its power vis-à-vis water in a number of ways:the state's territory is increasingly becoming part of a borderless world, water as a transborder issue redefines geography, community and powerstate sovereignty on water is increasingly eroded, new international rules and authorities govern water issuesstate autonomy on water issues is compromised, the state cannot act alone on water issues anymore, it has to consult with a number of various other actorsthe question of citizens' allegiance towards the state is challenge, new centres of public authority are created outside the state's jurisdiction and citizens are more likely to align themselves with a transnational social movement on a particular issuethe world is not anarchic, but rather a heterarchy, a system in which political authority is shared and divided between different layers of governance and in which various actors share in governingThis paper examines the globalisation of water issues, which relate to basic human needs and human health, food security, ecosystems, and national security. It addresses a number of emergent patterns in this process, including:the retreat of the statethe growth of transborder linksthe development and expansion of international lawincreased private sector involvement in global and national water regulation and managementthe spread of global social movements addressing water issuesthe increase in the number of global governance agencies involved in this fieldthe formulation of globally shared values with regard to waterThe paper concludes that, as the development and resource gap between developed and developing countries widen, an increase in the divergence between these economies is evident. The author claims that the answer does not lie in increasing the number of bigger water supply schemes, but in sharing water values on a global scale.States are increasingly dependent upon other state and non-state actors to ensure adequate quality and quantities of water. The emergence of an evolving global policy on water issues to address transborder water issues constitutes an emergent system of global governance reflecting increased political co-ordination among governments, intergovernmental organisations and transnational social movements. ;J-A.

eldis:A22407;Gender and land compendium of country studies;;"This compendium provides an improved understanding of the complex issues concerning gender and land. It draws on research commissioned by FAO. The authors argue that hunger and poverty are, in general, consequences of inadequate and restricted access to land and other resources, such as capital, inputs and technology; women are among those with less access to land, while accounting for a large share in small-scale food production.Rights to land, especially women’s rights to land, are determined by a complex interaction between the institutions, and underlying power relations, of a society. The paper pinpoints what these are in general, with illustrations from case studies. Drawing on this background, the analysis demonstrates the various ways in which women are constrained in obtaining and enforcing their land rights. Finally, women’s land access experiences in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia are summarised to provide referents from which women’s development in the future can be considered.The document considers various issues surrounding land and gender including:customary institutions and gender relations  traditional marriage practices as determinants of women’s land rights in sub-Saharan Africa Brazil and the legal status of women in the context of agrarian reform  women’s access to land in Nicaragua  ";;;Sustainable Development Department, FAO SD Dimensions;eldis;01/01/2005;en;"land;land tenure;land rights;land registration;agriculture";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"NIC;419;BRA";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A22407;ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/a0297e/a0297e00.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.fao.org%2Fdocrep%2Ffao%2F008%2Fa0297e%2Fa0297e00.pdf;;;;"Land registration;Gender and poverty reduction strategies;gender;Gender human rights and equality;land tenure;Agriculture and food;Gender;land rights;Women's rights;Land tenure;agriculture"
eldis:A61680;Rising global interest in farmland: can it yield sustainable and equitable benefits?;;"This paper analyses issues that affect the role of agriculture as a source of economic development, rural livelihoods and environmental services. Using experiences of land expansion in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa, it assesses the extent to which recent demand for land differs from earlier processes of area expansion and identifies the current challenges, in terms of land governance, institutional capacity and communities’ awareness of their rights. The report also compares countries’ policy and legal and institutional frameworks, and identifies good practice.The authors argue that outside investors have contributed to poverty and loss of livelihoods, for example, through displacement of local people without proper compensation, land being given away well below its potential value and approval of projects that were only feasible because of additional subsidies. The authors claim that many countries lack in institutional capacity and management of land information; official records of land acquisitions are often incomplete and there is a widespread neglect of social and environmental norms. The paper notes that deficient processes for local consultation and unclear boundary descriptions create several problems, including reduced tenure security and investment incentives, increased likelihood of conflict and difficulties in monitoring whether investors comply with agreements made with local people.The report makes the following recommendations. 

    Civil society and the local government should educate communities about effectively exercising their rights and assist in the design, negotiation, implementation and monitoring of investment projects.
    Protected areas must be identified to prevent encroachment and avoid negative social and environmental impacts. 
    The public sector’s capacity for processing investment applications, reducing red tape and ensuring that subsidies are clear, equally distributed, nondistortionary and incentive-compatible, needs to be improved.
    International organisations should assist countries to integrate information and analysis on large-scale land acquisition into national strategies and	offer financial and technical support for capacity building.

The aim of this eight-year project was to boost the incomes and food security of small farm households and arrest their decline into marginalisation and landlessness.Outcomes of the project include: sustainable changes have been brought about by the projectimpact surveys show that 85% of respondents now use the skills and knowledge they received from training and will continue to do sobetween 1995 and 2000 the amount of land used to grow vegetables increased by 186% from 2,750 to 8,950 hectaresnew training and community centres facilitate communication on marketing issues or availability of social servicesimplementation was not participatory: greater expertise in participatory development and group mobilisation is needed in future projects of this kindthe potential for livestock development should be given higher priority and where NGOs are involved in government projects more effective coordination between the two is vital.Key insights from the evaluation include:lack of credit for small farmers is a constraint to agricultural development and needs strengtheningparticipation is the key to people-centred development yet it was understood differently by various partners. Greater expertise and knowledge of participatory development and social mobilisation during the planning stages would ensure that sound concepts and implementation strategies are adopted from the outsetstronger project design such as the flexibility to modify project activities during implementation, if necessary, would ensure greater impact.[adapted from author] ;;;Office of Evaluation and Studies, IFAD;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"food security;farmers;water management;environment;rural development;landlessness";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"BGD;034";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14964;http://www.ifad.org/evaluation/public_html/eksyst/doc/profile/pi/bd.htm;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifad.org%2Fevaluation%2Fpublic_html%2Feksyst%2Fdoc%2Fprofile%2Fpi%2Fbd.htm;;;;"Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Environment;food security;Water management and irrigation;Bangladesh;Participation;water management;natural resource management water;Small-scale farmers;Agriculture and food;Micro-Credit;Agricultural policy;rural development;Rural development;marginalisation;Environment Natural Resource Access and Management;landlessness;participation;Environment and natural resource management"
eldis:A18145;Diamonds are forever, wars are not: is conflict bad for private firms?;;Using microeconomic data for Angola, this paper studies the relationship between civil war and private investment in a poor, resource abundant country. In order to do so, the paper focuses on diamond mining sector and conducts an event study on the sudden end of the conflict, marked by the death of the rebel movement leader in 2002.Findings of the study include:the stock market perceived this event as ‘bad news’ rather than ‘good news’ for companies holding concessions in Angola, as their abnormal returns declined by 4 percentage points this effect is sizeable and statistically significant, and is not likely to arise from unmeasured shocks to the diamond industry occurring at the same time, as the event had no effect on a control portfolio of otherwise similar diamond mining companies this finding is also affirmed  by other events and by the adoption of alternative methodologies: using nonparametric techniques with daily data on the intensity of conflict, finds that moderate level of violence increased the abnormal returns of the Angolan portfolio.The paper points out that results should be interpreted in the light of the widespread rent seeking in the Angolan mineral industry. The occupation of parts of the territory by the rebels and the instability created by civil war may limit the government’s ability to extract rents as well as the threat of entry of new firms, and thus be beneficial for incumbent companies. ;"M.

eldis:A61676;Biocharred pathways to sustainability? Triple wins, livelihoods and the politics of technological promise;;Considerable hype and debate are currently surrounding the potential of biochar (charcoal created through the burning of biomass in low oxygen environments) in climate change mitigation and agriculture. This report attempts to summarise the arguments, assumptions and interests in the biochar debate and offer reflections on its prospects. The report begins by outlining what it calls the triple-win of biochar.   The production of biochar can be tuned to release bioenergy or biofuels in the form of syngas and bio-oil, thus providing decarbonised biomass fuel.  The burial of biochar can potentially enhance soils significantly, helping to retain nutrients and water whilst reducing the need for fertilisers.  It is claimed that biochar resists degradation, thereby sequestering carbon within the soil for hundreds if not thousands of years.   In effect, we can potentially reverse the course of the last few hundred years by returning excess carbon to the ground. Mitigation effectiveness could vary considerably depending on a number of factors, including the type of biomass grown and indirect land use change impacts. For instance, clearing old growth forest to plant biochar feedstock could potentially have negative effects on carbon sequestration. The report concludes that waste-based systems hold the advantage on both technical and sustainability grounds and low-tech projects in developing countries have the greatest cost-effective potential.  Risks and uncertainties are also discussed, for example the possibility of land-grabs for the production of biomass feedstock. The final section of the report concerns biochar's capacity to increase agricultural productivity through soil enhancement, which is a topic of considerable debate. The report underlines that while more research is needed, it is important to not allow mere potential to lock-in the favouring of scale and profit over local livelihoods. ;"M. Leach

eldis:A66842;Joint-titling of land and housing: examples, causes and consequences;;"Across the world, low rates of land ownership remain as one of the most persistent signs of gender inequity. While many developing countries have adopted legislation to reinforce gender equality in property ownership, the actual de facto state of women’s right to land often remains unchanged. Even when countries adopt joint-titling policies intended to shift household bargaining power in favour of women, actual rates of joint ownership are often lower than expected. However, there are some examples at the national, state, city and project level where progress has been made towards getting women’s right to land formalised, either as single or joint-holders of a land title.To better understand how this progress can be achieved, this report documents several cases from around the developing world, and offers lessons drawn from the study:

     legislation which is “gender neutral” is often not enough, as neither title-granting institutions nor households will be concerned with joint-titling if it is not the default position for married couples


     NGO/CSO involvement seems to be an important driver of both legal and political reform. However, the examples where NGO/CSO involvement waned after large political or institutional successes resulted in poorer joint-titling outcomes than those where involvement included low-level interventions, such as education and programmes to get past last mile problems


     institutional learning is an important factor, as land authorities and governments do learn from their mistakes. However, because land titling schemes are costly and imply large `sunk’ costs, if learning does not happen quickly enough then it may be very difficult to overturn existing inequities


     having institutions in which the interests of women are well-represented can ensure that titling programmes are successfully backed


     institutions tasked with implementing joint-titling policies seem to be more effective when they have incentives to do so


     on-the-ground information and advocacy can help in getting past last mile problems. Similarly, incentives at the household level can be useful in enticing land owners to jointly-title

eldis:A27786;Social Exclusion and Land Administration in Orissa, India;;Examines—from the perspective of transaction costs—factors that constrain access to land for the rural poor and other socially excluded groups in India. They find that:  Land reform has reduced large landholdings since the 1950s. Medium-size farms have gained most. Formidable obstacles still prevent  the poor from gaining access to land. The complexity of land revenue administration in Orissa is partly the legacy of distinctly different systems, which produced more or less complete and accurate land records. These not-so-distant historical records can be important in resolving contemporary land disputes. Orissa tried legally to abolish land-leasing. Concealed tenancy persisted, with tenants having little protection under the law.  Women's access to and control over land, and their bargaining power with their husbands about land, may be enhanced through joint  land titling, a principle yet to be realized in Orissa. Land administration is viewed as a burden on the state rather than a service, and land records and registration systems are not coordinated. Doing so will improve rights for the poor and reduce transaction costs—but only if the system is transparent and the powerful do not retain the leverage over settlement officers that has allowed land grabs. Land in Orissa may be purchased, inherited, rented (leased), or—in the case of public land and the commons—encroached upon. Each type of transaction—and the state's response, through land law and administration—has implications for poor people's access to land. Mearns and Sinha find that:Land markets are thin and transaction costs are high, limiting the amount of agricultural land that changes hands.  The fragmentation of landholdings into tiny, scattered plots is a brake on agricultural productivity, but efforts to consolidate land may  discriminate against the rural poor. Reducing transaction costs in land markets will help. Protecting the rural poor's rights of access to common land requires raising public awareness and access to information.   Liberalizing land-lease markets for the rural poor will help, but only if the poor are ensured access to institutional credit.

eldis:A22212;The local politics of land and water: case studies from the Mekong Delta;;This document takes a historical view of the relations between individual and collective actors in local water management in the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam. It identifies and analysis the genesis and operation of institutional arrangements, forms of organisation, rules, and standards and contracts regulating access to natural resources, in particular water and land, in a context of agrarian colonisation and progressive anchorage of the State.Emphasis is placed among other things on conflicts, why they emerged or did not emerge, the players involved, regulation modalities, and the role of the authorities in arbitrating disputes. The analysis of these process is done through an exploration and understanding of farming logics, changes and innovations in agricultural activity systems, and the insertion of forms of agriculture in a network of social and economic ties with entrepreneurs providing agricultural services. Beyond this, this document situates these analyses in the larger framework of the evolution of Vietnamese agricultural policies and evaluates their real weight in the various national ruptures in the local political economy (colonisation, Vietnam war, south-Vietnamese regimes, unification) and the decisive stages of the national agricultural policy and land tenure reform.The document is available for download from the GRET website in  3 separate parts. ;"P-Y.

eldis:A27785;Access to Land in Rural India;;Access to land is deeply important in rural India, where the incidence of poverty is highly correlated with lack of access to land. Mearns provides a framework for assessing alternative approaches to improving access to land by India's rural poor. He considers India's record implementing land reform and identifies an approach that includes incremental reforms in public land administration to reduce transaction costs in land markets (thereby facilitating land transfers) and to increase transparency, making information accessible to the public to ensure that socially excluded groups benefit.Reducing constraints on access to land for the rural poor and socially excluded requires addressing five key issues: restrictions on land-lease markets, the fragmentation of holdings, the widespread failure to translate women's legal rights into practice, poor access to (and encroachment on) the commons, and high transaction costs for land transfers.Among guidelines for policy reform Mearns suggests:  Selectively deregulate land-lease (rental) markets, because rental markets may be important in giving the poor access to land. Reduce transaction costs in land markets, including both official costs and informal costs (such as bribes to expedite transactions), partly by improving systems for land registration and management of land records. Critically reassess land administration agencies and find ways to improve incentive structures, to reduce rent-seeking and base promotions on performancePromote women's independent land rights through policy measures to increase women's bargaining power within the household and in society generally.

eldis:A29115;From conflict to consensus: towards joint management of natural resources by pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in the zone of Kishi Beiga, Burkina Faso;;This article explores the breakdown of complementarity between agriculture and livestock in the Kishi Beiga area in the north of Burkina Faso. The article suggests that the the two systems now compete for land and local management systems have broken down.This article discusses  a joint GTZ and Government of Burkina Faso initiative to improve natural resource management and people's livelihoods. The project encountered the following problems:a participatory community-based land use planning approach, worked initially but it was later found that this was inadequate to deal with the social realities and complexities of the regiontranshumant pastoralists were not representedsocial relations between groups were affecting the outcome of project activities in a way that the project was unable to understandmanagement of communal assets was problematicAs this approach was not successful a new set of strategies were adopted. These more successful strategies included:focusing on social groups rather than territorial units.  This entailed programme activities shifting towards facilitating consultation and collaboration among the different groups within the community, using participatory methodsacknowledging the role that historical processes played in causing local tensions and rivalries among the population in Kishi Beiga, thereby contributing to the breakdown in natural resource management systems. This involved considering the ways in which political regimes, local power structures and land tenure policies have shaped social relationships within the regionfinding appropriate entry points for discussion, changing the role of development agents, building partnerships and supporting legitimate local leaders and resource people ;"M.

eldis:A12177;Gender, water and poverty: key issues, government commitments and actions for sustainable development;;"Overview of the relationship between gender, poverty and water. The first section explores how, in every corner of the globe, women play a central role in managing water supply and distribution. It also examines how access to water and sanitation has implications for women’s health and economic activities. Case studies highlight water projects and initiatives that have succeeded in elevating women’s status.Section two presents strategies for translating government commitments on gender, poverty eradication and water and sanitation into action by advocating for a gender perspective in all water and sanitation related policies. As a fundamental component of sustainable development, water is a strong entry point for  global advocacy on connected issues such as human rights, economic justice, poverty, reproductive rights, land, health, HIV/AIDS, and energy. Also in this section, women experts put forth their own guidelines for integrating gender in water use and management for poverty eradication. Section three, in the form of an insert, is a compilation of existing government commitments on gender, poverty and  water—including the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002 Johannesburg, South Africa); the UN Millennium Summit (2000, New York, U.S.); the Fourth World Conference on Women (1995, Beijing, China); the International Conference on Population and Development, (1994, Cairo, Egypt); and global water  conferences. Advocates can use this matrix as a tool for  monitoring government action At the end of the paper is a list of websites, contacts and other resources that can be used to get involved. [author] ";"P.

eldis:A29116;Who's managing the commons: inclusive mangement for a sustainable future;;"This article discusses what is the best means of managing the commons. The article stresses that these are critical questions in the current wave of decentralisation and tenure reform taking place in many Sahelian states. Although governments are passing new legislation to devolve the responsibility for managing natural resources to local communities, and despite growing awareness of the vital role of the commons in local livelihood systems, there is still some resistance to transferring power to local communities.The article concludes that:the policy environment in the Sahel, though not perfect, is broadly favourable to devolved natural resource management, Donors, NGOs and government ministries are becoming increasingly aware of their “new” roles as facilitators and adopting, albeit gradually and with some reticence, more participatory approachesagainst this broadly favourable backdrop there are numerous local initiatives working to identify appropriate tenure arrangements for the peaceful and sustainable management of common property resources in the Sahel. Many of these efforts are led by local groups themselves seeking to resolve conflicts over resource access at the community-levelinfluencing policy within the arena of common property resource management in the African drylands, particularly in relation to pastoral land use, has proved to be very difficult. This situation can be explained by a flawed understanding of the dynamics of Sahelian production systems and the importance of political dynamics (i.e. policies serving the interests of particular groups rather than users of common lands)a major constraint to the joint management of common property resources is the high level of transaction costs incurred in trying to involve different groups in an equitable, transparent and democratic way. Given these costs, it is necessary to demonstrate its benefits not only to the local community but policy makers as well. Empirical research can play a vital role in this processSahelian ecosystems are unpredictable, diverse and dynamic. To cope with this situation land use management strategies need to be flexible to accommodate change and uncertainty; they need to be equitable to take account of multiple user rights; and they need to be locally managed to promote sustainable use. There are no perfect models to determine how land and resources should be managed, only some basic principles ";"C. Hesse

eldis:A19518;Commerce and conflict: Angola & DiamondWorks;;By applying a template for risk assessment to the operations of the Canadian company DiamondWorks in Angola during the 1990’s, this report highlights the complex and dynamic interplay of commerce and conflict. Conclusions and observations arising form the analysis are designed to aid businesses returning to Angola in the creation of corporate strategies designed to avoid disrupting the peace process currently underway in Angola.The report identifies a number of high risk factors that characterised the situation in Angola during the 1990’s, and which are still present to some extent today:rentier/corrupt government: Resulting in weak social and economic infrastructure and a lack of accountability and representationmilitarisation of the diamond industry: Resulting in habitual human rights violations and consistent, low intensity conflict punctuated by high intensity periods of warhigh number of refugees and IDPs: Destabilising the country and negatively impacting already deplorable living standards and human developmentunequal distribution of resourcescorporate participation in violence through use of private security organisations.The report highlights that in such a volatile situation, a company can choose from three different ways of operating:they can work around the conflict, by treating the conflict as an impediment or negative externality that is to be avoidedthey can work in the conflict, by developing a risk mitigation approach to business operationsthey can work on the conflict, by which involves conscious attempts by the MNC to conduct business with its’ primary focus on conflict prevention, management, and resolution.With regards to DiamondWorks operations, it can be said that their activities in Angola were largely attempts to work around and in the conflict. DiamondWorks sought to “conflict proof” its operations through the use of private security organisations and personal-use infrastructure. This, however, did not bring about the desired results. For the future companies that want to operate in Angola will have to develop  corporate policies that avoid aggravating a still fragile situation. ;"A. Stevens

eldis:A61790;Global environmental outlook 5: environment for the future we want;;"The fifth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) analyses the state, trends, outlook and responses to environmental change. It assesses progress towards meeting internationally agreed goals and identifies gaps in their achievement.The outlook examines the drivers of environmental change and the overarching socio-economic forces that exert pressure on the environment. Drivers such as population dynamics, economic demand, and unsustainable consumption and production patterns are processes that affect the environment and result, directly or indirectly, in increased emissions and destructive resource extraction. The report notes that, as pressures on the Earth System accelerate, several critical global, regional and local thresholds are close or have been exceeded. This can lead to abrupt and possibly irreversible changes to the Earth's life support functions with significant adverse implications for human wellbeing. According to the report, lack of reliable and consistent time series data on the state of the environment is a major barrier to increasing the effectiveness of policies and programmes. Moreover, despite evidence of continuing deterioration, many important drivers of environmental change, or their impacts, are not systematically monitored.The report makes the following recommendations for countries:

    monitor and assess the environment and integrate social, economic and environmental information into decision-making processes
    standardise approaches and build capacity for data collection
    invest in enhanced capacities and mechanisms at local, national and international levels to achieve sustainability
    strengthen global institutions to fulfil human needs while avoiding environmental degradation
    standardise approaches that address the underlying drivers of anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System, especially population growth and overconsumption.

eldis:A28209;Land ownership and foreigners: a comparative analysis of regulatory approaches to the acquisition and use of land by foreigners;;Foreign ownership of land has historically been a sensitive political issue,and measures to regulate or restrict the practice in one form or another have figured prominently in national land laws. The study by Hodgson, Cullinan and Campbell provides an overview of the various regulatory approaches that have been devised to deal with this issue. The authors do not propose a definitive answer as to the desirability of restricting or regulating foreign ownership, a judgement which they suggest will be influenced by a wide variety of economic, political, cultural and geographic factors in different countries.  Instead, they put forward a framework for analysis and a representative sample of legal techniques and strategies that can be used to tailor specific solutions in different contexts. ;"S. Hodgson

eldis:A17575;Pastoralism on the margin;;This report focuses on the sustainability of pastoralism in the lowlands of the Great Rift of East Africa and the Horn, arguing that pastoralism as a mode of production and a way of life has entered a phase of decline, often accompanied by conflict, drought, famine and flooding.The report details the historic evolution and chief characteristics of pastoralism, discussing the eras of colonialism and independence, livestock development, land tenure and conflict, as well as local and regional politics. It focuses on the main approaches for stakeholders in dealing with the decline of pastoralism, detailing the main areas that need to be addressed and strengthened if pastoralism is be sustainable in the long term:The human rights approach: in particular the UN Declaration that requires states not only to protect all human rights and freedoms without discrimination, but to promote them through appropriate policies and legislation.  The author argues that international law is weak in a region where group rights are likely to be respected only when corresponding political power can be brought to bear on the state, which is not the case for the majority of pastoralist groupsThe environmental approach: argues that mobile livestock production is the only ecologically sustainable land use strategy for the fragile ecosystems of the region. Evidence of areas that have turned into dust-bowls when cultivation replaced livestock grazing supports this approach according to the reportThe economic approach: singled out as the most effective method, which relies on showing the contribution that mobile livestock production makes to local and national economies.In strengthening pastoralism throughout East Africa and the Horn, the report makes a number of recommendations to national governments and donor agencies.Recommendations to the governments of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda include:governments should fulfil their obligations to implement in full international human rights treatiesensure that the rights of pastoralist women are protected in theory and practiseensure that recognised systems of land tenure includes the protection of the use of land by pastoralistsdesign electoral systems and other forms of participation that allow women to be equally represented in governmentPoverty Reduction Strategies Paper should recognise and address pastoralism concerns.Recommendations to donor agencies include:existing and new donor projects should be reviewed for any effect they may have on pastoralist way of life, particularly land usesupport new and existing mechanisms that fairly determine pastoralists right to land usefunding of education should be evaluated.[adapted from author] ;J.

eldis:A12479;Balancing agricultural development and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon;;"Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model this report identifies the links among economic growth, poverty alleviation, and natural resource degradation in Brazil. It ex- amines the effects of a major devaluation of the Brazilian real (R$); improvements of infrastructure in the Amazon to link it with the rest of Brazil and bordering countries; modification of land tenure regimes in the Amazon agricultural frontier; adoption of technological change in agriculture both in- side and outside the Amazon; and fiscal mechanisms to reduce deforestation.By modelling land use, land cover and agricultural activities land uses, incomes, wage rates, and other aspects of the economy are estimated in 4 regions. The report finds that In the Amazon a devaluation of 40 percent has these results:Deforestation rates would vary depending on the government’s crisis plan. If the government balances reduction of private consumption, government demand, and investment, deforestation rates would decline by 10 percent in the short run and by 2 percent in the long run. However, government inaction and capital flight would lead to a 6 percent increase in deforestation in the short run and 20 percent in the long run.Logging would increase by 16 to 20 percent depending on government action.The Amazon would fill the domestic demand gap created as other regions move toward tradables. Following the devaluation, agricultural expansion in the Amazon would centre on production of a variety of annual crops and livestockThe analysis finds that improved infrastructure would result in:A 20 percent reduction in transportation costs for all agricultural products from the  Amazon causing increased deforestation of 15 percent in the short run and by 40 percent in the long runRising returns to arable land (and resulting deforestation) would lead to a 24 percent increase in production by smallholders and a 9 percent increase by large farms. Nationally, this would have little effect on welfare, because the increase in production in the Amazon would replace production from other regions.Regulating tenure regimes is one of the best options for reducing deforestation in the Amazon according to the authors who find that removing the speculative incentive to deforest could reduce the deforestation rate by 23 percent.According to the model the impact of improvements in agricultural technologies in the Amazon varies:Livestock technology -  improvements appear to yield the greatest returns for all agricultural producers in the Amazon and should improve food security in the region, but deforestation increases dramatically in the long run.Perennial crop technology -  improvements could theoretically reduce deforestation rates considerably, but this is unlikely to happen. Small farmers stand to gain the most from such improvements, but they are averse to the risks inherent in perennial crops. Annual crop technology  appears to have little potential. Income gains would be quite small. Before reaching the high land intensity required to  reduce  deforestation  rates,  there  would almost certainly be a period in which deforestation would increase substantially.To take into account the nonmarket benefits and costs stemming from different land uses, the report considers both taxes and transfer payments. The author argues that in spite of the link between logging and deforestation, applying a logging tax in the Amazon would not lead to a decrease in the deforestation rate, but it would negatively affect the logging industry. A tax on deforestation activities, however, would reduce deforestation with logging only minimally affected. Such a tax would, however, have a substantial negative effect on small farmers in the Amazon. An alternative scenario suggested in the report would be to subsidise forest conservation. From a welfare standpoint, the Amazon would benefit directly from a subsity of this kind, and the other regions would also gain by taking up the slack in the volume of wood. Market benefits accrued nationwide would exceed the subsidy expenditures. The subsidy could be funded internationally if Brazil were compensated for  reducing  deforestation  under  carbon  trading arrangements with other countries.[based on IFPRI summary] ";A.

eldis:A68408;Climate change and sustainable water management in central Asia;;"This working paper explores adaptation options in Central Asia. It describes the results of research conducted by a technical assistance in Central Asia. The research combined field observations with satellite-based data and created models to demonstrate the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the Aral Sea Basin. The adaptation options explored can be summarised in three broad categories: 1) Expanding the supply of water available in the future, 2) Increasing the productivity of water and 3) Reducing future demand for water.

The paper argues that climate change will put additional challenges on decision makers to manage water resources in a beneficial way both to the environment and human life and that solutions are possible when decision makers act adequately, resources are available and actions are taken in common understanding of all countries.

eldis:A20542;Extracting transparency: the need for an International Financial Reporting Standard for the Extractive Industries;;In the light of an emerging International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for the extractive industries - which could give a significant boost to global efforts to better account for revenues from the extractive industries - this report argues that such standards should require upstream extractive industry operators to disclose revenue payments on a country-by-country basis.Country-by-country reporting, this report argues, are crucial in achieving greater transparency, and will allow for better informed decisions about companies engaged in the extractive sector. It will allow small and large shareholders including analysts and institutional investors, as well as other stakeholders, including governments and citizens, to know how much a company is earning and paying to governments in the different countries where it operates. Broadly speaking companies should make the following information available on a country-by-country basis:commercial performancetaxes and other benefits paid to governments reserves.In conclusion the paper argues that:the data which has been suggested be disclosed could be produced at relatively little cost because it should all already be available to the companies operating in this sectortany remaining cost is more than outweighed by the benefit this data will supply to investors and other users of the financial data published by the reporting entity within the upstream extractive industrytthe enhanced credibility of data produced will provide commercial benefit to companies operating in this sector by providing clear comment on:their commitment to transparency their acceptance of their obligations to the societies in which they operate their desire to avoid reputational risktheir commitment to their investors, wherever they might be located. ;;;Publish What You Pay;eldis;01/01/2005;en;"mining;extractive industries";;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A20542;http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC19781.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldis.org%2Fvfile%2Fupload%2F1%2Fdocument%2F0708%2FDOC19781.pdf;;;;"Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;Extractive industries diamonds;Extractive industries oil;CR frameworks;CR frameworks Reporting and auditing;taxes;oil;Extractive industries;financial reporting standards;revenues;Extractive industries mining"
eldis:A42802;Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD) - the link with wetlands;;"This paper summarises the importance of wetlands in relation to climate change and eaxmines their potential role in the measures for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) under the Kyoto Protocol. The links between REDD concepts and wetlands are explored for the following reasons:

    so that REDD proposals do not perpetuate a negative perception that forest are only important because of the carbon that they contain
    to highlight some comprehensive frameworks of international and national nature conservation and forestry legislation that could provide an entry point for REDD proposals
    to emphasise the need for REDD funds not to be focused solely on reducing emissions, but also to contribute to related initiatives such as the improvement of forest governance and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

The author advances the arguments below for expanding the definition of REDD concepts to include wetland ecosystems. 

    Some forests are also wetlands and such a form of synergy can exist between REDD and the Conventions on wetlands (Ramsar) and biodiversity (CBD).
    Given the high capacity of peatlands to store carbon compared to other soil types, there may be greater carbon benefit per dollar to give priority to forested wetlands in implementing schemes for REDD.
    Forest areas involved in REDD should be more viable in areas where there is better wetland conservation and river basin management.
    There has been substantial advocacy in recent years for considering the role of ecosystems other than forests in contributing to “avoided destruction and degradation” methods of reducing emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Peatlands and other wetlands have been acknowledged as obvious contender for integration into a post-2012 framework.
    Degradation and disturbance of naturally-functioning wetlands can be (and already is) a major cause of increased carbon emissions.
    Overall, the long-term positive effect of CO2 sequestration is greater than negative effect of methane emissions from wetlands.

The paper concludes that there is great scope for synergy and mutual reinforcement of REDD proposals and other international conventions such as the Ramsar Convention and the CBD. One angle would be to conceptualise some “wetland-REDD” mechanism that produces associated benefits for conservation of biodiversity. ";D.

It argues that this project is doing ground-breaking work with means that, for the first time, while increasing agricultural productivity and enhancing resilience to climate change, smallholder farmers in Africa will receive benefits for greenhouse gas mitigation based on sustainable agricultural land management. The project has developed an activity monitoring system for sustainable agricultural land management (SALM) practices that enables smallholder famers and extension service provider to track and improve farm production. Based on the development of a carbon accounting methodology this system, in combination with a carbon model, is monitoring soil and biomass carbon sequestration consistent with the Verified Carbon Standard. As a result farmers in Africa for the first time can benefit from international voluntary carbon markets.

The paper describes the Vi Agroforestry extension approach, outlines the project objectives and activities, and explains the carbon accounting methodology. Project achievements and lessons learned, but also the challenges that still lie ahead are presented. The authors conclude that the project model has great potential for scaling up and provide a potential blueprint for widespread adoption and effective monitoring of sustainable agricultural management in smallholder conditions.

The main lessons learned are identified as:


	Focus on smallholder farmers’ interests
	A strong extension service with decades of focused extension experience
	The monitoring system used should be cost effective, demand driven and user friendly


One of the future ways forward identified is scaling up. It is highlighted that  Vi Agroforestry, together with partners, has conducted feasibility assessments in Uganda and Malawi to start similar projects based on their ongoing experience. It is also argued that the project serves as a model for Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the agricultural sector and a number of government and development partner initiatives are underway to explore possible modalities based on the Durban Action Plan of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Public awareness raising and consultations is identified as an important element of further scaling-up for sustainable agricultural management in Africa and other regions. The lessons learned are taken to indicate that this model can be used on a large scale and would benefit from modifications and lessons learned from implementation in other geographic locations, social and environmental settings.

eldis:A44199;Why should mediators consider the economic dimensions of conflicts?;;"This paper summarises the case for greater consideration of the economic dimensions of conflicts in mediation processes – particularly those concerning natural resources. The author highlights the recent United Nations Environment Programme publication, From Conflict to Peace building – the Role of Natural Resources and the Environment as further evidence of the need for this inclusion. For instance the report finds that:

    40 per cent of all intrastate conflicts since 1960 have a link to natural resources
    less than a quarter of peace agreements for conflicts with links to natural resources address the management and governance of natural resources
    intrastate conflicts linked to natural resources are twice as likely to relapse within five years. 

The author then highlights a number of reasons why economic issues have been sidelined in the mediation process:

    mediators’ understandable focus on political and security-related issues
    a perception that economic issues are in any case best addressed after peace agreements
    the sensitivity of discussing the profit motives of parties directly and indirectly involved in the conflict. 

The paper then details a number of recommendations to address economic issues. These include:

    avoiding vested interests when choosing the mediators themselves
    mapping the warring parties’ economic agendas and alliances
    not apportioning natural resources as spoils of war 
    creating mechanisms to monitor economic issues post-agreement
    putting lootable natural resources out of reach.

eldis:A27019;The concept of rangeland carrying capacity in sub-saharan Africa: Myth or reality?;;"Ever since colonial administrators and western trained scientists became involved in sub-Saharan Africa in the early 20th century and were faced with the task of governing countries where livestock production was a major economic enterprise, the proper utilisation of rangelands became a major concern. While during most of the colonial era devastating epidemics (like rinderpest and pleuropneumonia) kept the growth of livestock populations in check, during the 1950s and 1960s regional campaigns of eradicating these major cattle diseases created a continuous increase in livestock numbers. It is estimated that between 1963 and 1970 annual growth of cattle populations averaged 2.8%, but slowed down to 1.25% per annum during 1970 to 1980 (Antenneh 1984).While up to the 1950s constraints of feed shortages for livestock were outweighed by those of disease, concern over looming imbalances between supply and demand of grazing resources led to large investments in projects of water development, many of which were financed by foreign aid. This provision of water to hitherto underutilised grazing lands further stimulated herd growth, but at the same time encouraged more settled modes of production and reduced mobility. While watering rights of man-made traditional wells were tightly enforced and served as a control on over-exploitation, water sources that were publicly financed were open to all, breaking the age-old equilibrium between water and rangeland use (Sandford 1983, Swift 1984).The need for establishing criteria and ways for determining the carrying capacity of African rangelands became more strongly felt when in the 1960s and 1970s several regions were hit by droughts (1960 to 1961, 1973 to 1976 in East Africa; 1969 to 1973, 1979 in West Africa) causing enormous stock losses.This paper investigates common approaches to determine carrying capacity, elucidates the problems associated with applying the concept in sub-Saharan Africa, and suggests ways of broadening the concept to improve its applicability in this continent.

eldis:A12698;Fostering community-driven development: what role for the state?;;"This paper examines case studies from Asia and Latin America to show the possibilities for states to tap into community-level energies and resources for development if they seek to interact more synergistically with local communities.Using case studies from Asia and Latin America, the report shows how: State efforts to bring about land reform, tenancy reform, and expanding non-crop sources of income can broaden the distribution of power in rural communities, laying the basis for more effective community-driven collective action; and Higher levels of government can form alliances with communities, putting pressure on local authorities from above and below to improve development outcomes at the local level. These alliances can also be very effective in catalysing collective action at community level, and reducing ""local capture"" by vested interests. There are several encouraging points that emerge from these case studies. these powerful institutional changes do not necessarily take long to generatethey can be achieved in a diversity of settings: tightly knit or loose-knit communities; war-ravaged or relatively stable; democratic or authoritarian; with land reform or (if carefully managed) even without.there are strong political payoffs in terms of legitimacy and popular support for those who support such developmental action.

It demonstrates the challenges faced in the creation and implementation of agreements with stakeholders on economic and environmental areas of sustainable development in the extractive industry. The report highlights key issues discussed relating to maximising economic benefits and minimising negative environmental impacts. Maximising economic benefits:it is in the interest of the extractive companies to raise the standards of the industry’s operationsacting in unison will not only level the playing field it will also enable the extractive industries to deal with the free-rider problem in the long runmore research also needs to be done to define the monitoring role that can be undertaken by the international finance community, such as commercial banksbanks and financial institutions are lagging behind the industries in addressing corporate responsibility issues. It is important that they become more accountable for the destination of their capital and the potential impacts of their investmentsif financial institutions are to act as effective monitors of extractive industry standards then an objective, fact-based, multi-stakeholder governance body could be set up for the financial sector to vet projects and to act as ombudsmanmultinationals should also use their power to hold their banks to higher financing standardsinterim steps could include better ESIA systems, and objective, measurable, usable financing criteria. The OECD governments could introduce transparency as well as social and environmental standards and guidelines to their export credit agencies (ECAs)Minimising negative environmental impacts, some possible next steps include:engage actively in key international conference processes and intergovernmental forabuild trust through relevant and effective partnershipswork towards developing more effective land use planning systemsmake an inventory, codify and disseminate best practice and standardsestablish a credible and independent mechanism that guarantees consistent application of standardscontinue reviewing and improving protected area classification systemsimprove guidance on priority areas ;;;Chatham House [Royal Institute of International Affairs], UK;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"environment;mining;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A13942;http://www.riia.org/pdf/research/sdp/RIIA%20Extractive.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riia.org%2Fpdf%2Fresearch%2Fsdp%2FRIIA%2520Extractive.pdf;;;;"Mining;corporate social responsibility;environmental standards;Extractive industries oil;guidelines;ethical business;standards;Environment;extraction;oil;Extractive industries;extractive industries;Corporate Social Responsibility;Extractive industries mining;environmental degredation"

eldis:A26834;Struggles of Access to land. The 'Squatter Question' in Coastal Kenya;;"In Kenya and the sub-Saharan Africa generally, there have been little systematic discussions on the post-colonial struggles over control and ownership of land. Studies ignore that the ""land question"" is not about production alone and consequently have failed to assess its wider consequences on the society. This raises the question, ""what is the current socio-political dimension to the land question and what is the consequence of their interplay with other changes underway in the country?""  This Working Paper addresses this question by discussing popular struggles of access to land in the coastal region which studies seem to have ignored despite its distinct political history. The Working Paper is based on results of a survey conducted in Kilifi district, Coast provinces, between September 1995 and November 1996 [author] ";K.

eldis:A26956;Ecological factors in land use conflicts, land administration and food security in Turkana, Kenya;;This paper employs an historical analysis to consider some of the consequences of conflicting resource use and political friction on resource exploitation within and outside Turkana District during this century. Given this historical context, development alternatives tested to ameliorate food insecurity are reviewed.The article proposes that the stage for political conflicts, environmental degradation and food insecurity within the region was set decades ago. The indigenous livestock economy has been seriously weakened, following pacification by colonialism at the turn of the century and by the predatory raids which have continued. The after-shocks of these events have created ripples in the social security system, leaving the pastoralists more vulnerable to periodic droughts. The intrinsic capacity of the people to buffer droughts has diminished, forcing the majority to seek assistance in redressing food insecurity. The paper examines these relationships within a historical context and seeks an explanation as to why development measures undertaken to ameliorate problems of food insecurity has so far failed to produce desirable results. ;G.

eldis:A28679;Reassessing Kenya's land reform;;This article discusses issues surrounding land reform in Kenya. As the nature of land reforms is as yet undecided, disparate suggestions and proposals are being considered. These include:Land Ownership Ceilings. There are vast inequalities in land ownership. Indeed, non-indigenous Kenyans or corporations that are not significantly Kenyan own the largest consolidated quantities of Kenyan lands. Ceilings on land ownership, would encourage more equitable distribution of land, perhaps facilitating more effective production and a  reduction in food security problems. Such a move will naturally interfere with individual property rights.Land sub-division is a common phenomena in productive agricultural areas of Kenya. This provokes an increasingly unproductive agricultural sector, consisting of uneconomical units with diminishing returns and overall declining value. In this context, the article suggests that restrictions may need to be set on such fragmentation. This may be problematic for several reasons:Such restrictions would interfere with individual property rights and freedom of useA distinction must be made between the negative effects of fragmentation of agricultural land and sub-division of non-agricultural land, which may be beneficialAs a consequence of these two potential problems, it may be more acceptable to encourage land consolidationUnrestricted freedom of ownership should be encouraged. Land should be considered as a resource, which is subject to sale like any other commodity. Within a culturally diverse nation such as Kenya, it is important that regional monocultures are not encouraged by restricting land ownership to specific ethnic or racial communities.Ethnic land rights should be respected, requiring a restriction of entitlement of the acquisition by individuals/groups that are not affiliated with the specific community, ethnicity or race associated with a particular locationAs a result of the government abusing its powers of trusteeship over the public asset of the land, the government should cede control of public land to a custodian of public assets answerable to parliament.Land law should be simplifiedConclusions:Land reform issues remain complicated by reasons ranging from legal complexities, political involvement, corruption and the extreme poverty in the countryGiven the present circumstances, the arguments proposing the restriction on land ownership with regard to ethnic and racial size will lead to retrogressive and unacceptable social and economic outcomes.While meaningful land reform is necessary, it can only be meaningful as a component of wider economic reform [Author] ;;;Institute of Economic Affairs, Kenya;eldis;01/01/2000;en;"corruption;land;land reform;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KEN;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A28679;http://www.eldis.org/fulltext/land.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldis.org%2Ffulltext%2Fland.pdf;;;;"redistribution;povgdn;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;land reform;corruption"
eldis:A42148;From exclusion to ownership? challenges and opportunities in advancing forest tenure reform;;"In 2002, Forest Trends reported that in recent decades governments had begun to reduce their legal ownership and control of the world’s forests. This document evaluates whether this forest tenure transition continued in the 2002–2008 period, and assesses the implications of statutory forest tenure change for forest people, governments, and the global community. The report is based on the monitoring of governments’ data on formal and legal tenure by the Rights and Resources Initiative. The authors find that the transition did continue in the 2002–2008 period. The area of state ownership declined and there were corresponding increases in the area owned by communities and indigenous peoples. Progress is however slow. Some of the main problems faced include: 

    action on human, civil, political, and gender rights is also necessary to improve wellbeing but progress on this front is slow
    the area of industrial concessions still greatly exceeds the area of forest designated for use by, or owned by, communities and indigenous peoples
    industrial claims on forest lands are increasing sharply, for biofuels production among other reasons
    some governments are performing poorly in carrying out the reform process
    statutory reforms do not always result in more secure tenure. 

The report recommends specific roles that groups of stakeholders can play in advancing reforms. These include the following:

    governments can create and publicly disseminate strategies for implementing tenure reforms and establish, strengthen, and support independent judicial arbitration systems
    multilateral agencies and private sector entities investing in REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) strategies and carbon markets may become sources for complementary funding for accelerated reforms 
    forest-dependent peoples can self-organise and get involved in debating the pros and cons of REDD arrangements
    industries making investments on forest lands should take advantage of the opportunity to demonstrate support for and compliance with free and informed consent provisions
    forest management certifying bodies can take on board tenure and rights in their standards and consider certifying small and medium forest enterprises that are alternatives to the industrial model
    environmental NGOs can promote the creation of pro-poor systems of payments for ecosystem services.

eldis:A69299;Land governance in South Africa: implementing the Land Governance Assessment Framework;;"The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is an innovative and participatory diagnostic tool that assesses the state of land governance in a country. This booklet summarises the results of the LGAF process in South Africa.

The paper indicates that the application of the LGAF in South Africa has been challenging. The country has a well-developed economy, including a well-functioning formal land market. However, informal systems, especially within the communal land areas, are steeped in oral tradition and practice.

The observations made during the LGAF process include:


	land management involves a wide range of sectors, legislation and specialists
	urban and rural areas are often so closely interlinked, which makes any distinction between them difficult and sometimes artificial
	tenure in South Africa is very complex, with over 100 different tenure types


Consequently, the author suggest the following key areas for further examination:


	improved tracking of large-scale land acquisition in Africa and its impact; tracking is currently mainly through media reports
	the preparation of a methodology and related tools for supporting municipalities in the implementation of an incremental tenure approach
	the development of a possible legal framework for supporting the implementation of an incremental tenure approach
	support with the drafting of suitable legislation to enforce communal land rights

This manual intends to serve the needs of agencies and organisations that are interested in facilitating such community organising, NRM planning and implementation, community-based natural product enterprise development, and the integration of NRM groups or natural products enterprises into rewarding value chains. It has evolved out of the experiences of implementation of a diverse range of CBNRM projects in Nepal. It outlines five distinct phases from identifying and organising the community to integrating community enterprises into value chain. These five phases comprise the five core chapters of this manual and cover: 

    Phase 1: identifying and organising community for natural resource management and enterprises giving the example of how community forest user groups in Nepal identify, secure and manage community forest areas
    Phase 2: developing and implementing participatory natural resource management plan by  assessing resources by conducting a resource inventory and developing an operational management plan
    Phase 3: implementing the approved natural resource management plan and ensuring forest products are harvested at a sustainable level
    Phase 4: developing and implementing community-based natural products enterprise plan by conducting a feasibility study and sub-sector analysis and preparing a business plan 
    Phase 5: integrating community enterprises into value chain following an analysis of the value chain, identification of appropriate linkages and developing systems for sustainable service delivery

eldis:A15125;Conflicts in Joint Forest Management: cases from South Rajasthan, India;;Joint Forest Management (JFM) has been an important step for improving amangement and governance of forests in India. However, conflicts and conflict resolution arrangements in the JFM framework are one area where there is urgent need for attention. This paper attempts to bring out some of the major areas of conflict in the JFM arena based on the experience of the author while working in Udaipur on implementation of JFM projects in India.The author finds that:the question of who should decide on the patch of forest that is to be protected, whether communities themselves, the Forest Department, NGOs or a combination of thesesboundary conflicts between neighbouring villages/communities are the most commonly cited conflicts in JFMformalising rights over a particular patch of forest is invariably problematic, since the complex and elaborate customary use patterns are seldom mapped and addressed adequately before a patch of forest is brought under the ambit of JFMconflicts often surface between the three main players in JFM, the Forest Department, communities and the NGOs, as these three stakeholders do not perfectly share the objectives of JFM and the ways and means to achieve themthe issue of benefits sharing is a major potential flashpoint, and the timeframes within which benefits materialise can alter dramatically from one region to anotherthere are questions over whether partners in JFM are equally accountable to one anotherconflicts created by JFM at the village level itself need to be better understoodThe author concludes that understanding and articulating the realities of fragmentation within communities needs to be improved, along with the attitudes of various layers of forest bureaucracy and their respective interactions with the forests that are to be transformed from being an open access resource into a common property resource. The author suggests that the basic philosophy that should govern progress towards conflict-free joint management strategy would be based on ‘Domain-Consensus’, which would mean that every party is clear about and in agreement with the roles the other players would play in the whole arrangement. ;P.

eldis:A38681;Depopulating the Tibetan grasslands: national policies and perspectives for the future of Tibetan herders in Qinghai Province, China;;"Tibetan grasslands constitute one of the most important grazing ecosystems in the world and encompass the source areas of many major Asian rivers. While a variety of government policies have been applied in recent years to protect the ecology and biodiversity of China’s grasslands, there is growing concern that national and global economic considerations have overshadowed emerging conservation agendas. This article critically reviews several key policies affecting pastoralists, with special attention given to the Sanjiangyuan region of Qinghai Province. The document finds that since 2000, when the Western Development Strategy began, China and the world have come to recognize the global importance of the Tibetan plateau  region, both as a “water tower” and as a geographic region with a unique natural and cultural heritage. In practice, however, emphasis has been primarily on conservation matters, including the establishment in 2003 of the second  largest nature reserve in the world. In many instances, the socio-cultural impact has been dramatic, demanding much of local people including change/loss of livelihoods and breakdown of community ties.Specific impacts noted include:

    the  resettlement of villages has occurred as a result of the “Ecological Migration” policy, a dramatic attempt to protect	the ecology and biodiversity of the headwaters of the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong rivers
    a fairly rapid transition from a rural “nomadic” lifestyle toward the increased sedentarization has taken place following the “Four way scheme” to alleviate poverty in rural Qinghai. This has led to a decrease in seasonal mobility and flexibility within livestock management practices, essential components of  Tibetan nomadic pastoralism for centuries
    families have been asked to move off the grassland and to adopt new livelihoods in farming or to live in new towns, as part of the Western Development Strategy 
    the full application  in 2007 of the long-standing 9-year compulsory education law requires  all children between the ages of 7 and 11 to begin primary education, and complete 9 years of education.

Despite some benefits of these policies, the author argues that  the speed and apparent resolve with which such sociocultural and development transitions are being introduced in grassland areas raise the important question whether there is any other way by which so-called “sustainable development” (and biodiversity conservation) can come effectively to the Tibetan grasslands before all alternative doors are closed.The article proposes a contrasting and more people-centered approach to conservation and development, drawing on nearly 10 years’ experience of active collaboration with local communities, NGOs, and government authorities in the headwaters of the Yangtze River. Citing the success of the Yangtze River Headwaters Sustainable Development Project - a collaborative development project of Plateau Perspectives, the Upper Yangtze Organization, and the Government of Zhiduo County - it argues that a model for combining conservation and development through genuine community participation  could usefully be applied more widely in China’s grasslands, and possibly more generally throughout western China.

eldis:A72246;Property rights in land reform areas;;"Land redistribution or the transfer of ownership rights to the tiller has been the focal point of the land reform program in the Philippines. This transfer was envisioned to result in a significant shift in income and productivity in the agrarian sector. While some equalisation of incomes may have indeed occurred, the full benefits of this asset transfer, however, have not been realised. This Policy Note suggests that the reason might be due to the fact that ill-defined land rights brought about by regulatory and bureaucratic impediments have rendered such lands as practically ""dead capital/asset."" The roots of this property rights problem are traced in this paper.

eldis:A65462;Large-scale land acquisitions and food security;;"DFID are looking to propose that the UK supports a package of measures to strengthen land transparency and ultimately governance. This work is of a high priority for DFID and the wider UK Government. Following further research on the evidence and internal discussions, DFID have identified a gap relating to two specific questions:

1.    What are the impacts of large-scale land acquisitions (LSA) on local food insecurity and malnutrition levels? 
2.    Is there a difference in impacts whether investments are international or local? 

This report presents a brief assessment of the available literature which attempts to answer these questions. There is an ample and high quality debate being conducted about the impact of LSAs on livelihoods and food security, both in the academic world and between the protagonists either side of the LSA debate. However, the assessment finds very little direct analysis of food security and malnutrition using scientific means such as nutritional and anthropometric surveys. ";C.

eldis:A36005;In control of natural wealth? governing the resource conflict dynamic;;"This paper tests the impact of resource governance on the resource-conflict dynamic. It examines the impact of resource type, abundance and dependence on risk and duration of violent conflict, whilst also exploring the importance of the governance of natural resources in preventing or overcoming the resource-curse. It is argued that for many developing countries, the extraction of natural resources has been a blessing, as their export can provide urgently needed development capital. For others, however, resource wealth has been a curse, as their population still faces extreme poverty and they have been haunted by corruption, government failure and violent conflict. The paper confirms that good governance can effectively contribute to the prevention of resource-related conflict and help alleviate the results of the resource curse on poor developing countries. It further argues that steps currently under-way internationally to boost the governance of natural resources are encouraging in that it will be possible to break the resource-conflict trap and improve the living conditions for those in most need. Key conclusions include that: 

    the relationship between natural resources and violent conflict is shaped to a large extent by the quality of the governance of those resources, which in turn is a correlate of good governance in general 
    resource abundance as well as resource dependence positively correlate with both the risk and the duration of violent conflict 
    strengthening governance is a concrete measure the international community must take to reverse the resource curse and build peace and development 
    effectiveness of resource governance can be improved through the development of measures to reduce corruption as well as the transparent management of revenues for purposes of sustainable and diversified development.

eldis:A12351;Capitalizing on conflict: how logging and mining contribute to environmental destruction in Burma;;This paper presents information illustrating how trade in timber, gems, and gold is financing violent conflict, including widespread and gross human rights abuses, in Burma. It argues that although trade in these conflict goods accounts for a small percentage of the total global trade, it severely compromises human security and undermines socio-economic development, not only in Burma, but throughout the region.The paper presents two case studies of two zones where logging and mining are both widespread and the damage from these activities is severe.Findings include:cease-fire agreements signed between the late 1980s and early 1990s have dramatically expanded the area where businesses operatea host of abuses, from lack of participation of local communities to loss of livelihood and violence, are responsible for the deterioration of the environment and traditional cultural practicesthe conflict only exacerbates these problems and reinforces the downward spiral of suffering in the areas examinedboth case studies highlight the dilemmas cease-fire arrangements often pose for the local communities, which frequently find themselves caught between powerful and conflicting military and business interestslocal communities feel compelled to participate in the unsustainable exploitation of their own local resources, even though they know they are destroying the very ecosystems they depend upon to maintain their way of life. The other alternative (to stand aside and let outsiders do it and then be left with nothing)  is equally unpalatableThe paper concludes that the case studies are classic illustrations of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights, protection of the environment, peace and sustainable development.

eldis:A66822;Securing community land and resource rights in Africa: a guide to legal reform and best practices;;"Land that is possessed, occupied and used by communities according to ‘customary law’ is the most common system of land and resource ownership in Africa. Customary law is the framework of rights, rules and responsibilities based on community customs and practices, governing ownership and management of a community’s lands, territories and resources.

This guide explains key aspects of law and land rights that are important for securing community ownership and control of land and resources – also referred to as secure land and resource tenure. It explains how to identify and create opportunities for law reform and offers examples of reforms that have taken place in several African countries.

The guide iaims to:


	support an understanding of key aspects of a ‘good’ law and law reform process -  laws and reforms that both respect human rights and are implemented, enforceable and participatory
	
	give guidance on how to critically analyse an existing law or a proposed draft law
	
	
	provide ideas on how to make the best use of law reform opportunities that arise

eldis:A11029;Who should own Indonesia’s forests? Exploring the links between economic incentives, property rights and sustainable forest management;;Indonesia’s forests have been disappearing rapidly since the 1980s: 1.8 million hectares per year are estimated to have been deforested between 1985 and 1997. Consequently, there is a possibility that in some areas, the forests will cease to function as a viable resource base in the near future.This paper examines the role of economic incentives in causing deforestation, focussing on policies that distort prices and create the conditions for unsustainable harvesting. It reviews theoretical approaches to the economics of resource use and analyses the ways in which Indonesian government policy affected the incentives of the various stakeholders.It argues that:government interventions such as restrictions on log exports and tax concessions to processing industries encouraged the expansion of wood processing industries in Indonesia and resulted in unsustainable levels of deforestationlarge-scale land conversion for commercial purposes, such as the development of oil palm plantations, were responsible for accelerating deforestation in the 1990suncertain tenurial arrangements and property rights, unenforceable contractual obligations, and weak monitoring and enforcement by the government exacerbated this situationthe forest management system does not provide efficient structures of control rights to any of the sector’s many stakeholdersas the state exerts sole control rights over most forested area in the country, other stakeholders depending on incomes from the forests have only limited control rights over their livelihoodsthe lack of well-defined property rights prevented stakeholders from being able to trade their control rights so as to improve the efficiency of forest management.Considering directions for future research, the paper argues that, given the many unresolved land conflicts between local communities and government/private interests, research on the interaction between market-based and common property rights or community-based property rights regimes would be of particular importance.The paper concludes by recommending that:the charging system used by the government for access to the forests should be simplifiedrigorous inspection and monitoring systems should be establishedadequate forest resource accounting systems should be provided. ;"R.

eldis:A22499;Strengthening transparency in the oil sector in Cameroon: why does it matter?;;This paper analyses transparency issues in Cameroon's oil sector. It shows that, while substantial efforts have already been undertaken, continued action is necessary to strengthen transparency. The paper also identifies why and how transparency, especially in the fiscal area, matters for economic development and poverty reduction in Cameroon.The report highlights that if efforts to strengthen transparency are consistently pursued, economic and fiscal policymaking will be more effective, the business environment will improve, and more resources will be freed for investment in social sectors and basic infrastructure, thereby supporting economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in Cameroon.Recommended measures to increase transparency include:contractual information on the production-sharing agreements between governments and oil companies should be made public. If the authorities and the oil companies insist that contracts are confidential and should not be made public, they could at least publish key parameters to illustrate how oil resources are allocated between oil companies, the national oil company, and the governmentbudget transparency could be strengthened by the full and timely transfer of oil revenues to the treasury and gradually shifting to a classification by economic naturefacilitating further public scrutiny would contribute to changing public sentiment on government accountability. Steps in this direction include making the technical secretariat of the EITI committee fully operational quickly, proceeding with consultations with the private sector and civil society, and formulating and implementing a specific consensus-based action planimplementing the EITI principles, beyond the progress already made, would clearly indicate that Cameroon strives to comply fully with international standards on oil transparency. ;S.

eldis:A10676;The impact of regulation on the livelihoods of the poor;;"The key concept of the Global Strategy for Shelter, and its successor the Habitat Agenda, is that of enabling; of governments' stepping back from housing production and measures to control the price of outputs and, instead, working to enable the current and potential suppliers of housing to do what they do best. A major part of the enabling process is to set in place a regulatory context in which urban development can be sustainable and of the scale required for all to be adequately housed. This inevitably means a reduction of standards so that they are realistic. Two groups who are currently supplying housing are “transformers” and home-based enterprise (HBE) operators:UL>Transformers are households who take a dwelling that is designed as a finished item and extend and alter it to fit their needs better. They supply housing goods – rooms, services, improvements to bothHBE operators use housing in ways that differ from the intention of the plan. In doing so, they tend to alter and extend it, they also tend to require and afford more than those without HBEs; they are actors in the housing process.Some  HBEs have added to household incomes and their ability to pay for housing while not generating much in the way of negative externalities. In this paper, the authors argue that regulatory frameworks have much to learn from these organisations and that standards should be liberalised to cope with and benefit from them. ";G.

eldis:A32725;No one has the liberty to refuse: Tibetan herders forcibly relocated in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and the Tibet autonomous region;;"This paper explores the extent of Chinese resettlement policies in Tibet. It focuses on the impact of these policies on Tibetan herders from a human rights perspective and based on its findings puts together a number of recommendations to international donors, the United Nations (UN) and the Peoples republic of China. Since 2000, the Chinese government has been implementing resettlement, land confiscation, and fencing policies in pastoral areas inhabited primarily by Tibetans, drastically curtailing their livelihood. Many Tibetan herders have been required to slaughter most of their livestock and move into newly built housing colonies in or near towns, abandoning their traditional way of life. Key recommendations include: 

    the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) should impose a moratorium on all resettlements until a review mechanism can be established 
     international donors must ensure that funds lent for development projects in the areas described in this report are not resulting in forced resettlement 
    the human rights Council and the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should raise questions about China’s policy of forced resettlement 
    the Chinese and international infrastructure companies investing in Tibetan areas should adopt explicit policies supporting human rights and establish procedures to ensure the involvement in projects, doesn’t contribute to human rights abuses.

eldis:A27658;Rural livelihood diversity in developing countries: evidence and policy implications;;"Examines livelihood diversification as a survival strategy of rural households in developing countries. Although still of central importance, farming on its own is increasingly unable to provide a sufficient means of survival in rural areas. The paper’s objectives are first, to increase awareness of livelihood diversification in approaches to rural development; second, to consider the interactions among diversification and poverty, farm productivity, natural resource management and gender relations in rural areas; and third, to advance the policy understanding of diverse rural livelihoods.
Policy conclusions: 

    Reform in the sense of good governance is unfinished business in rural areas; in most low income countries an enabling andfacilitating environment for the spread of diverse non-farm income-generating activities can hardly be said to exist.
    Human capital is widely substantiated as a key to successful livelihood diversification; the delivery and quality of rural education and skills acquisition requires continuing emphasis.
    Infrastructure (roads, power, communications) has a powerful effect on mobility and choice, it continues to merit priority.
    The current emphasis on micro-credit is not misplaced, despite growing recognition of certain weaknesses to which it is prone;continued innovation and improvement of rural micro-credit schemes in poor countries helps to promote diversity.
    Enhancing the asset status of rural women merits special attention; including their human capital, independent ownership rights over land and other resources and participation in social processes.

eldis:A25582;Comments on papers 29b (De Leeuw and Tothill 1990) and 28b (Scoones 1989);;In their recent paper, de Leeuw and Tothill (1990) discussed the shortcomings of estimating carrying capacity (CC) of pastoral systems in Africa. They noted the difficulty of determining available forage per animal due to high annual and spatial variability in plant production, seasonal changes in forage quantity and quality, livestock species mix, and the use of supplemental feeds. Nevertheless, they concluded that the concept `is useful for planning purposes' and that `the underlying principles on which it is based need full acceptance' if sustained resource management is to be accomplished. While agreeing with their review of problems associated with the concept, the article takes exception to their conclusions. The article's authors presents their arguments by addressing the following three questions:is the concept of CC sound?can CC be adequately estimated?can CC information, even if we could obtain it, be meaningfully applied in pastoral production systems? Finally, the article offers an alternative approach for conserving rangeland resources in pastoral systems. ;"G. B. Bartels

eldis:A67281;Towards understanding South Africa’s differing attitudes to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Open Governance Partnership;;"Recent figures from globally established indices reveal diverging perceptions about the state of transparency and corruption in South Africa.

This paper undertakes a critical assessment of the various motivations behind South Africa’s active participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), as a contrast to the country’s notable absence from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Indeed, although the South African government is one of the eight pioneering states to have officially launched the OGP on 20 September 2011, it is not a signatory to the EITI, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in 2013. How has the South African government justified its absence from the EITI so far, and what do these justifications mean for its participation in the OGP?

The paper focuses specifically on developments regarding access to information in South Africa – namely the Promotion of Access to Information Act – and their implications for the country’s attitudes towards global transparency initiatives. The paper also considers the ways in which the South African government’s discourses, practices and contrasting approaches vis-à-vis these two multilateral transparency frameworks hold relevance for access to information in the country’s extractive resource sector. It suggests that the South African government may be more responsive to EITI-membership appeals if it perceives that its aspirations as an emerging power, both regionally and globally, are better acknowledged.

eldis:A71226;Scaling up index insurance for smallholder farmers: Recent evidence and insights;;"This report explores evidence and insights from five case studies that have made significant recent progress in addressing the challenge of insuring poor smallholder farmers and pastoralists in the developing world. In India, national index insurance programmes have reached over 30 million farmers through a mandatory link with agricultural credit and strong government support.

In East Africa (Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania), the Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) has recently scaled to reach nearly 200,000 farmers, bundling index insurance with agricultural credit and farm inputs. ACRE has built on strong partnerships with regional initiatives such as M-PESA mobile banking. In Ethiopia and Senegal, the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative has scaled unsubsidized index insurance to over 20,000 poor smallholder farmers who were previously considered uninsurable, using insurance as an integral part of a comprehensive risk management portfolio. With strong public and private sector support, the Mongolia Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project (IBLIP) insures more than 15,000 nomadic herders and links commercial insurance with a government disaster safety net. Finally, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) project in Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrates innovative approaches to insuring poor nomadic pastoralists in challenging circumstances. A few common features appear to have contributed to recent progress within these case studies:


	explicitly targeting obstacles to improving farmer income
	integration of insurance with other development interventions
	giving farmers a voice in the design of products
	investing in local capacity and
	investing in science-based index development.


Evidence from these case studies can inform the ongoing debate about the viability of scaling up index-based insurance for vulnerable smallholder farmers in the developing world. The rapid progress observed in recent years suggests that index insurance has the potential to benefit smallholder farmers at a meaningful scale, and suggests the need to reassess arguments that lack of demand and practical implementation challenges prevent index-based insurance from being a useful tool to reduce rural poverty.

eldis:A14060;Indigenous peoples and mining encounters: strategies and tactics;;This paper argues that mining can not be considered ‘sustainable’ if indigenous cultures are rendered unsustainable in the process. Given that many remaining unexploited ores lie under indigenous lands, there is increasing pressure to mine on or near indigenous lands.  While mining has the potential to empower indigenous peoples, previous encounters have stripped them of their sovereignty, traditional wealth and have posed multiple impoverishment risks.The paper:develops a framework to map the encounter between indigenous peoples and the industryreviews the history of previous encounters to highlight the strategies and tactics used by governments, companies, NGOs, international financial intermediaries and indigenous peoplesdevelops an empowerment model, including fifteen sustainability elements, and argues that the more these elements are incorporated into encounters, the greater the chances of a sustainable outcome for indigenous peoples and other stakeholdersFindings of the paper include:encounters between indigenous peoples and the mining industry have largely resulted in a loss of sovereignty for traditional landholders, and the creation of new forms of poverty due to a failure to avoid or mitigate impoverishment risks that accompany mining developmentnon-monetary indigenous ‘wealth’, which exists within their understandings of their social and environmental surroundings is threatened when faced with mining-induced displacement or resettlementmitigation of mining-induced impoverishment risks is possible, but is not a priority for the mining industryThe paper concludes that the probability of an empowered, sustainable outcome increases as each of the following elements is incorporated in a mining encounter:sovereignty is respected and strengthenedthe rights and access to indigenous land and nature is securedat the beginning, both the indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders’ presuppositions about one another are aligned with factthe desired outcomes of the encounter for indigenous peoples emerge from meaningful, prior informed consent and participationnon-indigenous stakeholders fully and opportunely disclose to the indigenous group their plans, agreements and financial arrangements related to the indigenous group in a culturally appropriate manner and languagelikewise, the non-indigenous stakeholders identify and disclose all the risks (social, economic, environmental) of a proposed mining endeavourprovisioning of benefit-sharing arrangements that step beyond compensation for damagesindigenous peoples, as informed group, have the right to approve, reject or modify decisions affecting their livelihoods, resources and cultural futuresshould restoration of a disturbed habitat prove impossible, then the non-indigenous stakeholders make provisions for an improved habitat that supports a lifestyle acceptable to indigenous peoplesthe basic human and civil rights are protected, as specified in international conventionsthe focus of the encounter is on protecting indigenous wealth, especially their social relations that guide the sustainable use of their natural resourcesfinancial and institutional arrangements are forged that bridge the discrepancy between the multigenerational timeframe of indigenous peoples and the short-time frame of mininga guarantor to assure compliance with and funding of any negotiated and mutually satisfactory agreementsIn addition, the paper recommends an extension of the environmental precautionary principle approved in Rio 1989 to the impact of mining on indigenous lands. ;"T.

eldis:A41148;Beyond tenure: rights based approaches to peoples and forests. Some lessons from the Forest Peoples Programme;;"Although the historical focus on tenure reforms has resulted in some important improvements in the livelihoods of forest communities, it has not prevented them from suffering social exclusion and impoverishment. Based on a review of 17 years of work with forest peoples in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by the Forest Peoples Programme, this paper explores the complexity of rights that need recognition if community-based livelihoods in forests are to be secured and well-being further improved.The case studies used in the paper illustrate the need for recognition of some the following rights of forest peoples, which in some countries do not exist:

        have free pursuit of the right to choose to market and/or commercialize forest products from their domains
        be protected from slavery, debt-bondage, and other slavery-like practices
        be given redress for and the restitution of illegally expropriated natural resources.

The paper ends by suggesting some steps of what forestry departments and development agencies need to do to make these rights operational. For forestry departments the recommendations include:

        invest sufficient time and resources into recognising land claims and resolving land conflicts, including processes for supporting community-led mapping
        ensure full transparency and public access to information in land and forest designation, licensing, and concession systems
        ensure the existence of national legislation that explicitly respects rights of indigenous peoples as set out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

For development agencies the recommendations include the following:

        support inclusive reviews of the national forest sector using a rights-based approach, with the aim of identifying practical steps to secure peoples’ rights
        support community-level trainings on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
        givetargeted direct support to community initiatives on forest management
        support initiatives for implementation of the right to free, prior, and informed consent through for example locally developed guides and third-party verification.

eldis:A70340;Land, biodiversity and the extractive industries in southern Africa. How effective are legal and institutional frameworks in protecting people and the environment?;;"In the natural resources sector, laws are often formulated to regulate the relationship between men and the environment. Ideally, the law can play a vital role in regulating and protecting communities from adverse environmental and social impacts of mining, loss of land, biodiversity and natural wealth, as well as other human rights violations. Almost all countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have developed laws and institutions to regulate and monitor the extraction of mineral resources and their impact on the environment and people. However, the level of implementation and enforcement of those laws varies across the region and in some cases legal gaps exist.

In light of this, the Southern Africa Resource Watch (SARW) commissioned research in three SADC countries – Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe – to assess the effectiveness of exiting legal and institutional frameworks governing land, social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector.

This policy brief analyses the findings of the three reports and identifies current legal and institutional frameworks in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana that seek to protect land, biodiversity and communities from the adverse impacts of mining. It highlights good practices while also capturing crosscutting weaknesses and gaps in the legal frameworks.

The policy brief also analyses the institutional capacities of responsible government departments, whose legal mandate is to monitor and hold mining companies accountable, and looks at the domestication and application of regional and international instruments. More importantly, the efficacy of voluntary practices and standards adopted by mining companies and financial institutions to promote social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector is also assessed.

eldis:A23916;Forests, agriculture, poverty and land reform: the case of the Indonesian Outer Islands;;The promotion of forestry activities is seen as a means by which to reduce poverty while protecting the environment. But if clearing of forests for agricultural activities can prove more profitable, will such efforts be effective? Through an analysis of the relative benefits of agriculture and forestry activities, this paper considers the extent to which forests can be relied on to support poverty reduction in developing countries.Through a data analysis and literature review, the study examines the empirical relationships among forest, poverty, agriculture and access to markets and services in the Indonesian Outer Islands. The data analysis is based on:vegetation cover produced from remote sensing images for 2003population and poverty estimates respectively at the village and district levelsthe national forestry land use planspatial analysisThe study finds that agriculture provides higher financial returns than forestry, and under the existing institutional, financial, and human constraints high forest cover in Indonesia is currently associated with high incidence of poverty.  Therefore, clearing forests located on suitable agricultural land may have a greater potential to contribute to poverty reduction than forestry. In such areas, to conserve forests, appropriate policies to compensate the rural poor for the foregone benefits of deforestation would need to be developed.However, the authors also stress that small-scale forest management and nonagricultural activities can also have positive financial returns and could also contribute to poverty reduction. Plans should therefore take into account not only the benefits of agriculture relative to forestry activities but also the benefits of policies aimed at helping rural people move into nonagricultural sectors. The latter policies would have the dual benefit of reducing poverty and accelerating the transition from deforestation to reforestation. ;"L. Tacconi

eldis:A23729;Investing in maintaining mobility in pastoral systems of the arid and semi-arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa;;This paper seeks to provide national and international policy-makers interested in the development of arid and semi-arid areas with background information and policy options, on whether and how to invest in mobility of pastoral systems in Africa.It first describes the trends leading to declining mobility, followed by a description of the key underlying causes for these trends and their impacts on mobile pastoralists. It then provides the rationale for investments and concludes with policy options which policy-makers face when deciding on priorities to be allocated to overall pastoral development, and to specific actions within pastoral development.Major policy options and their trade-offs fall under the following headings:Overall vision and development thrusts. These include the grounding of land-use decisions on human carrying capacity factors, arable farming versus pastoral grazing options, awareness raising through broad consultation, and strengthening pastoral organisationsDefining the incentive policies. Possibilities include payment for services, such as charging for water use, the provision of subsidised livestock feed, and compensation for environmental services, such as sustainable range managementDefining resource access policies- mainly ensuring access and user rightsDefining investments. These includes investments in infrastructure, social and technical services, and funding for researchPartnerships and knowledge sharing. The coordination and knowledge sharing among programmes on national and (sub) regional level would be an important asset. ;;;Livestock, Environment and Development, Virtual Research and Development Centre;eldis;01/01/2006;en;land tenure;;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A23729;http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/ele/econf_03_alive/download/Mobility.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.virtualcentre.org%2Fen%2Fele%2Feconf_03_alive%2Fdownload%2FMobility.pdf;;;;"pastoralism development policy;mobile pastoralism;Payments for environmental services;Agriculture and food;pastoralism policy;Pastoralism;payments for services;drylands;Animal production and health;pastoralism grazing and pasture;Land tenure;pastoralism common property;pastoralism investment;pastoralism land rights and tenure;pastoralism;Communal land"

eldis:A16632;India’s national agricultural policy: a critique;;"The National Agricultural Policy (NAP) document released by the Government of Indian in 2000 aimed to attain an agricultural output growth rate in excess of 4 percent per annum, based on efficient use of resources, and sought to achieve this growth in a sustainable and equitable manner.This paper argues that (by 2004) no serious action had been initiated on most of the NAP’s proposals, and blames this inaction on the lack of a concrete and time bound action plan to complement the policy.  It highlights the failings of the policy document, drawing on agricultural data from 1950 to 2001 including output, area cultivated, irrigation, and land use.Its criticisms of the NAP include that: the document does not stress the need for improved irrigation as a precondition to higher growth creating the required magnitude of irrigation would require trebling of public investment in real terms the NAP proposes to put India’s 79.5 million hectares of wasteland to use for agriculture and afforestation, but does not elaborate any strategy to do so; most of this land requires heavy capital investments in order to make it productivethe importance and implications of the increasing strain on India’s limited water resources are not adequately recognised by the NAP NAP is silent on important institutional issues such as participatory management of irrigation, water, forest and common lands.The paper’s specific recommendations for future agricultural policy include: care is needed to ensure that enough common property wasteland remains around inhabited areas to serve the needs of resource-poor rural communities who live there awareness about the value of water and its sustainable use needs to be raised water conservation measures such as rainwater harvesting should be put in place Panchayati Raj institutions should be given guidelines on taking care of healthy breeding practices for livestock technology policy needs to ensure both that appropriate technologies are generated and that they are effectively disseminated to end users interactions of Indian National Agricultural Research System scientists with science institutions in the west need to be strengthened competition should be promoted in the seed sector by encouraging large scale private sector participation in the seeds business area specific agricultural development strategies should be devised, taking into account groundwater status, soil health and other characteristics.

eldis:A23721;Making property rights accessible: social movements andlegal innovation in the Philippines;;Today, many rural poor Filipinos are using state law to try to claim land rights. In spite of the availability of a much stronger set of legal resources than ever before, claiming legal land rights remains difficult. Some argue these difficulties are a reason to turn away from state-led land reform and toward a market-assisted land reform (MALR) model. However, this paper indicates that a closer look at actual dynamics around land reform in the Philippines suggests that political-legal problems associated with implementation of the 1988 agrarian reform law can be overcome under certain conditions.The author argues that rural poor claimants must be able to access support for political-legal mobilisation, particularly “rights-advocacy organisation”, and they must adopt an integrated political-legal strategy. This will help push existing constitutional-juridical openings and institutional reforms in favour of land redistribution. An integrated political-legal strategy is one should be able to activate State agrarian reform law, building on independent State actors’ pro-reform initiatives, and resisting the evasive manoeuvres of anti-reform elites.[adapted from author] ;J.C.

The report suggests that those factors that constrain the growth of agricultural exports and manufacturing be addressed as a matter of urgency in order to return balance to the economy as a wholespecial care will need to be taken to ensure that the development of land for agriculture will not endanger the long-term sustainability of the cleared areas and of the adjacent watercourses. Where environmental difficulties arise alternative energy source (perhaps supported by some kind of subsidies) should be considered. In addition, any resettlement plan should ensure the preservation of adequate refuge areas for Zimbabwe’s rich natural flora and fauna. It is suggested that improvements of environmental policy should include encouraging new settlers to engage in various natural-resource enterprises, including eco-tourism.support for rural development should include support for the development of communal areas to stimulate growth rather than to focus only decongestion.a secure land tenure instrument to avoid problems with the land market (and associated credit access), arbitrary change in Government policy and nepotism the Government ensure that settlers are provided with adequate extension services in all aspects of agricultural and livestock productionthe current Agricultural Development Assistance Fund (the only institution with a broad mandate for agricultural credit for small-scale agriculture and with an extensive branch system) be established as an independent, semi-public credit institution to serve small-scale farmersthe rights of farm workers should be explicitly addressed, especially for those those displaced from gainful full-time or part-time jobs in the large farm areas, or who need  support in formalizing their citizenship and/or rights to land in resettlement or communal areaselaboration of policy on equitable gender-based land rights, providing it with a firm legal basis, operationalize it, and mobilising capacity to ensure its implementation and effective monitoringcreate a framework for improved humanitarian support and social services to assist those affected by food insecurity, the breakdown of fostering systems for HIV/AIDS orphans, and the spread of HIV infection during the implementation of the land reform and resettlement programParrallel improvements in capacity to manage any such programme are required.

eldis:A69790;Township replanning: the case of INK;;"The townships of Inanda, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu (INK) are about 25km north of the Durban city centre. The area covers 9340ha of land, and is home to about 580,000 people (18 per cent of Durban’s population) in 115,136 households.

INK has one of the largest concentrations of low-income households in South Africa. In the mid-1990s a number of smaller local councils in the greater Durban area were amalgamated into a single metropolitan municipality, and the city was expanded to incorporate a number of townships. Because the political violence of the 1980s had been more intense in INK than in townships to the south of the city, it was relatively less developed. Almost 77 per cent of households earn less than R1600 per month, only 27 per cent of residents are employed and about 43 per cent of the people do not have formal houses. INK comprises 18 wards and is managed as a single entity by the eThekwini Municipality.

This study looks at the township re-planning project of in the INK townships and makes recommendations for efficiency. The KwaMashu Town Centre (KMTC) project began in 1999 as a node for economic development in INK. At the time of this study, INK was characterised by very high rates of unemployment, poverty and crime; low levels of formal education; a lack of adequate housing and basic services; low levels of access to public services; a lack of public space and recreation opportunities; and high levels of environmental degradation and pollution.

In 2001, national government launched the flagship Urban Renewal Programme (URP) to address infrastructure deficiencies and declining economies in areas characterised by widespread poverty and neglect. INK is one of eight targeted ‘poverty nodes’ in former townships of South Africa’s six metropolitan municipalities. The infrastructure investment is aimed at:

• improving the delivering of community facilities;

• maintaining existing infrastructure; managing informal trade;

• enhancing road and pedestrian safety through physical works and education;

• addressing service backlogs; supporting crime prevention through appropriate infrastructure design;

• implementing the municipal land-use management programme;

• attracting investment through integrated spatial planning supported by local area plans and precinct plans; and

•developing and implementing an environmental land use and transport management system.

The paper concludes with the following ‘lessons learnt’: Look for linkages, deal with land issues, take careful account of stakeholder interests, clarify institutional roles and responsibilities, ensure plans take physical constraints into account, link capital expenditure to social goals, link small business to large business and pay attention to good intergovernmental relations.

eldis:A13199;Carbon accounting in forests: proceedings of an international workshop on 'facilitating international carbon accounting in forests' 2003;;The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to greenhouse and climate change, international frameworks, carbon sequestration and carbon trading. It focusses in particular on policy relating to Australia.The paper demonstrates that increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have been identified as a major cause of global warming. The Kyoto Protocol set the collective target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions of industrialised countries by 5% of 1990 levels by 2008-2012. Provisions within the Protocol would allow emission reduction projects, including afforestation and reforestation, to be set up in both developing and industrialised countries. Australia’s Federal Government has chosen not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However, it is committed to continuing to develop domestic programmes to meet the target Australia agreed to at Kyoto.The paper concludes that there is a need for internationally accepted standard accounting methods to assess the amounts of carbon in particular afforestation and reforestation projects. These are required to estimate the amount of carbon that may be traded or used as an offset against greenhouse gas emissions. ;T.H.

eldis:A101099;How pro-poor are land rental markets in Ethiopia?;;"Land rental markets can potentially improve the access to land for land-poor households that possess complementary resources that can enable them to utilize land efficiently. Land rental markets can also enable landowners who are poor in non-land resources to rent out their land such that their land is utilized more efficiently and they themselves can get a better income and improved welfare from their land resource. This report assesses the land rental market that is dominated by a reverse tenancy system with relatively poorer landlords and less poor tenants. This market has largely developed informally in Ethiopia but has also been shaped by the changing land policies. We assess how pro-poor it is and whether interventions potentially can make it even more pro-poor and welfare enhancing or whether a “hands off” policy is preferable. If we can detect a significant market failure, there is room for intervention. However, there are also a number of current interventions in the market. We assess whether these achieve the intended outcomes or rather should be lifted or modified.Population growth, economic growth, and structural transformation in agriculture may change the role of land from being the most important safety net and livelihood opportunity to become an important resource for agricultural transformation and development. The non-farm sector in Ethiopia has grown rapidly in recent years and provides new employment opportunities and this reduces the pressure on land as the only and main source of livelihood. Our study of land rental markets in Ethiopia covers communities in Tigray, Oromia and SNNP regions focuses particularly on the period 2006 to 2012, but draws on data and research that goes back to 1998 in Tigray and utilizes information from landlords and tenants and other rural households with male and female representatives, local Land Administrative Committee (LAC) members and local conflict mediators with long experience in handling local land disputes.In this report, we review the relevant literature and fill important gaps in this literature. These gaps include a) the stated reasons of landlords and tenants for partner choice and contract choice in the land rental market and their attitudes and preferences regarding regulation and formalization of land rental contracts; b) we investigate land access of youth in the land rental market; c) we assesses how joint certification of husbands and wives has affected participation in the land rental market; and d) how increasing population pressure and land scarcity affects land access and the land rental market over time.

eldis:A59780;Governing and implementing REDD+;;"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conserving and enhancing forest carbon stocks, and sustainably managing forests (REDD+) are emerging as a central policy instrument to halt land-use related emissions from developing countries. This paper uses the Earth System Governance Framework (developed by Biermann et al., 2009) to illustrate the key governance issues underlying the REDD+ initiative.The paper emphasises the absence of research on the politics governing the emergence of REDD+, particularly the influence of parties’ interests in determining negotiation outcomes, or on promoting particular financial mechanisms. The authors highlight three main pillars for a future research agenda:

    the politics of REDD+ in international and national negotiations 
    the interplay between REDD+ policies and measures and other developments in land-use related processes 
    the examination of the environmental and socio-economic outcomes of REDD+ activities, integrating locally informed monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) techniques and using robust counterfactual assessment methods.

eldis:A18276;Population pressure, migration and urbanisation: impacts on crop–livestock systems development in West Africa;;"Population growth and urbanisation are driving a livestock revolution. Mixed farming systems are the present and the foreseeable future of West African livestock systems, with concurrent changes in livestock feeding systems and the role of grazing, fodder and penning. The livestock economy has to be seen as part of a national economy in which urban and rural facets interact. Effective policies need to be based on recognition of the capacity of rural people to invest in improving their livelihoods. The population of West Africa has risen rapidly in the past 40 years and is expected to continue rising. However, rural population has increased slowly while urban population has grown dramatically  The result has been: an increase in demand for cereals and pulses (which produce crop residues for livestock) and a much increased urban demand for livestock productsgrazing land has diminished, crop residues are becoming a more important element in livestock raising, and fattening penned livestock has become profitablea shift of livestock raising southwards in West AfricaThe paper looks at farmers’ ability to adapt to changing markets for their products and the factors of production are illustrated with examples from Senegal, Nigeria, Niger and (by way of contrast) Kenya. This rapid change sets new challenges for livestock scientists, and they need to improve their methods or to change their priorities. Challenges include:better understanding of livestock economics:  the livestock element in a farming system is always very cursorily treated compared to the cropping element.  There appears to be a gulf between those who study the declining number of pastoralists (who often do look at matters like milk sales and seasonal feeding systems) and those who study the increasing number of farmers who incorporate livestock in an integrated farming system, who ignore these matters. There are very few studies of fattening economics, or the current market value of crop residues etc., or of changes and payments that occur in such things as access to stubble on farm land.  All these require attention if we are to  understand farmers’ strategies and their likely reaction to some suggested interventions or new technologies.reducing the disease risk under structural adjustment policies: how to finance veterinary services given reduced government resources (eg through the training of para-vet). Farmers may well be willing to pay more for effective vaccination services but are they asked about this? What are the priorities for a reduced veterinary service? It almost certainly is not an artificial insemination service, at least in Kenya where farmers find private bull services cheaper (costs vary according to the perceived quality of the bull). What can we do to help poor men and women make a more risk-free start with poultry?practical methods of increasing the utility of manure with inorganic fertilisers seen as additives rather than main source of replacement nutrients for the soil. These methods will have to take into account the limited labour availability in the farm family.practical preserving and processing methods for meat and other livestock products to increase their market rangeadapting recommendations to the current distribution of livestock: in the past few decades more people and livestock have moved into the subhumid zone to the south. Have technical recommendations developed for the semi-arid and pastoral zones been modified as necessary?developing practical methods of improving the nutritive content of crop residues and their storage. Practical means taking into account costs, access to materials (e.g. urea) and labour availability.developing multi-purpose fodder crops that would fit into existing farming systems and meet market needs including both crops that supply fodder and human food (e.g. certain legumes) or fodder and substitutes for expensive fertiliser. watering: is it a problem and what are the practical solutions? This may or may not be a problem in the context of fattening and dairy development.breeding: how should farmers take advantage of the spread of fattening techniques? If cows, sheep and goats are increasingly kept in enclosures, what are the implications for breeding? Are farmers already developing a market in the services of good sires, as in Kenya? Are research services taking advantage of this development?
 The most desirable policies for agriculture are those that work for farmers and enable and encourage their private investments and ability to adapt. It makes sense to seek complementarity between government investment and services and private investment, when most governments are facing reduced public resources per capita. Encouraging private investment requires:moderate taxation regimes (otherwise private households are left without resources of their own to invest)  good management of the economy, since private investors cannot make wise decisions in the face of unpredictable inflation or sudden changes in exchange ratesconcentrating government interventions on those areas where private investment and market incentives are insufficient, for example in veterinary services to combat disease or in providing rural roads and some types of water supplies. disseminating information, but leaving farmers to make their own judgements on whether to follow or modify it.improving rural people’s judgement by appropriate schooling as well as by extension services. Kenyan farmers send all their children to school, at least for primary education, and if possible for more, because they appreciate its utility for both non-farm and farming jobs. The utility of  education offered by state schools in West Africa appears less apparent to rural parents. Increasing the prosperity of the rural sector also requires the development of the urban sector which provides its main market. The symbiosis between the two is currently more evident in Asia than in Africa. Some effort is required from central and local governments and community-based organisations to increase both the productivity and market pull of a network of small towns. This may do more for farming than direct intervention, because all the evidence shows that farmers are very capable of responding to profitable new opportunities and markets. Productive towns require such infrastructure as electricity, water and  telecommunications, and so do villages that are in a position to grow into towns. All need to be linked by a good transport system. This may seem to be straying far from the needs of the livestock sector. However, livestock are an integral part of the national economy. Research into fattening, breeding for fattening, processing, and disease prevention are all needed, to help farmers meet the challenges of rapid change in their markets and in the rural/urban balance. Some research can be done as small-scale experiments assisted by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and CBOs. Some will be done by farmers themselves, exchanging information with traders and neighbours. Others need to be carried out by scientific institutions. However, no experiment, whether carried out by a farmer, an NGO or an international research organisation, will have lasting results unless it generates good profits under the labour, financial and climatic constraints under which people are operating. Farmers have to be good businessmen and if they are not, they are apt to end up as landless labourers.

It presents an econometric approach which develops a simple growth’s model with four ethnic variables and institutional regressors (a democratic and a rule of law index) along with two production factors (capital and labour).The report argues that these events shed light on how multi-ethnic societies are subject to “the tragedy of the commons” as each ethnic group seeks to benefit alone from common resources.

    New thinking needed to tackle the rural employment crisis 

A further 106 million people will have joined the rural labour force in the developing world by 2015. This article asks whether enough jobs can be created in rural areas to meet this demand, or whether further urban migration is the only answer. 

    How can small-scale producers compete globally? 

Rapid globalisation of agricultural trade is forcing small producers to compete with large enterprises that have better access to business services and a greater ability to meet international quality standards. This article argues that collective action in producer organisations is an important strategy for small-scale producers who want to access, compete in and increase their bargaining power in the market. 

    People’s access to common resources under threat 

Common resources and property, such as access to shared land, are important to many rural livelihoods. This article highlights how people’s access to common resources is under threat from outside interests and insecure legal rights.

eldis:A70530;Bush thickening and indigenous woody plants as a source of renewable energy;;"Surplus woody plants in areas where there is bush thickening present an opportunity to harvest the wood as bio-fuel. The health of the ecosystem and rangeland restoration must, however, always be prioritised during any tree harvesting for bio-fuel. In South Africa, indigenous woody plants are a prominent feature of the savannah, the largest of the vegetation biomes in South Africa and the Southern African sub-continent.

Several recommendations can be made in the interests of ecological sustainability and for maintaining long-term stability. These are of value to landowners affected by bush thickening, as well as government decision-makers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) involved in solving the problems associated with the bush thickening.

Recommendations:


	objectives of tree-thinning operations must be clearly identified prior to the harvesting operation
	the threshold value in terms of tree density that can be supported in a specific rainfall region without adversely affecting the grass layer must be determined prior to the harvesting operation. Harvesting of woody plant s should be done only in areas exceeding this threshold value
	emphasis should be on selective harvesting, during which larger trees are retained and smaller trees and shrubs are harvested, preferably of the problem tree species
	most woody plants will regrow again after cutting. While this may be seen as beneficial in the sense of a renewable resource, it is general ly considered undesirable from a restoration point of view. It is recommended than an appropriate and ecologically safe arboricide be used to treat cut stumps after harvesting
	as new seedlings might re-establish in thinned savannah areas, a state worse than the original thickened area may develop if left unattended. Post-treatment management such as a fire or a limited treatment with an appropriate arboricide may be required
	the bush thickening problem cannot be solved if its causes are not addressed. The most important aspect here is stocking rates of livestock and game. Landowners must comply with prescribed stocking rates and adequate rest of the herbaceous layer

eldis:A70283;Land use and cover change in pastoral systems of Uganda: implications on livestock management under drought  induced pasture ;;"This study assessed the extent of land use and cover change in Buliisa and Nakasongola Districts in the cattle corridor of Uganda over 27 years (1986 –2013), and their impacts on livestock management under drought induced pasture. The study found that area under open water and grassland declined by 3.5 and 48.3 per cent, while woodland, wetland, small scale farming and forest increased by 0.2, 62.2, 320.7 and 64.1 per cent, respectively, in Buliisa. In Nakasongola, grassland, bushland and forest decreased by 96.1, 25.6 and 17.2 per cent, respectively; while open water, bare ground, wetland, and small scale farming increased by 5.3, 210.9, 2.7 and 26.8 per cent, respectively, between 1986 and 2013. The paper argues that individualisation of land in Nakasongola led to settlement of cultivators and fencing of land leading to blockage of livestock migration routes. Reduced mobility of livestock during drought, increased stock densities resulting in land degradation exemplified by bare land in Nakasongola compared to Buliisa, where communal land ownership and limited cultivation enabled mobility.

eldis:A12459;Law, property rights, and social exclusion: a capabilities and entitlements approach to legal pluralism;;What are the effects of trends away from legal pluralism towards more uniform approaches to the law? This paper analyses the effects of legal changes in property rights for people's welfare and development in India. Sen's concepts of capabilities and entitlements are applied to study these effects in terms of changing rights regimes, and impacts on poor people's functioning arising from changes in livelihood options or a 'capabilities set'.Three areas are analysed:Land rights among tribal communities, focussing on the tendency to move away from pluralistic frameworks, which dilute the protective power of special land laws for tribal communities in the state of Andhra PradeshCommon property resources for subsistence of the rural poor, with comparative analysis of traditional norms for regulation and maintenance of such resources with newly introduced formal, and legal regulationsIntellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in agriculture, with several studies cautioning that developments in genetic engineering and biotechnology may pose significant dangers not only to biodiversity but also to protection of intellectual property rights of farmers and peasants in developing countries.The paper finds that:survival and livelihood strategies of the tribal people are threatened, and further marginalisation is likely if uniform property and land laws are introducednew rights regimes based on recognition of patents and internationally supported  IPRs threaten the survival of farmers in the third world, by reducing their rights and ability to experiment and innovate, and investing such rights solely in corporationsThe author concludes that:pluralistic legal systems in the field of natural resources, especially in relation to property rights should be retained and developeda diversity of laws and rules vesting different kinds of rights in individuals and communities, enhances capabilities and entitlements for individuals and households, especially among the poor and the marginalisedsimply providing additional legal rights or providing legal status to customary rights is not the answer, as such simplistic measures can end up distorting the rights regimes in manners that disadvantage the poorit is equally important not to treat customary property rights as determinate sets of rules, traditional or customary rights exist in the context of specific legal traditions that are themselves embedded in distinct institutional frameworksin the context of a dynamic, changing society, what is important to recognize is that communities and households are able to better adapt themselves to change, and retain their entitlements, if they have the ability to negotiate, bargain, and reorganize relationships of production and exchange, this can occur only of there is flexibility permitted by a pluralistic legal systemit is not the relationship of people to land that determines their social relations, but rather it is the relationships between individuals that determines rules and laws pertaining to property ownership or land tenure ;D.

As well as summarising trends in investment, trade, crop development and land tenure arrangements, the studies focus on the land tenure and human rights challenges.

Seven national updates have been compiled based on the available literature for Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Timor-Leste and the Philippines, each following a similar format. The studies seek to summarise what laws and policies already exist in national human rights frameworks that could ensure respect for rights in large-scale land development and, on the basis of this analysis, recommend possible solutions to the problems identified.

eldis:A68958;Global-to-local modelling of land use dynamics in Vietnam;;"This paper presents the preliminary results of two hypothetical futures for Vietnam, a High Climate Impact and a High Economic Growth Scenario.

The results of the study are taken to show that the structure of the Vietnamese economy, land distribution, and the composition of the food consumption basket are little affected by the scenarios. Impacts are, however, visible across sectors, with important inter-sectoral linkages between primary and processing industrial sectors. For example, climate change, primarily modelled via yields, is shown to slow down the economy. An increased demand for land by crops at the cost of livestock and commercial (production) forestry pushes up land prices with knock-on effects for the rest of the economy. Food security deteriorates across the globe and in Vietnam, with substitution towards cheaper imports. Pursuing higher economic growth by increasing yields and technological progress in manufacturing and agriculture sectors can turn these developments around and minimise land price increases.

eldis:A61779;An institutional analysis of biofuel policies and their social implications: lessons from Brazil, India and Indonesia;;"This paper examines how developing countries have attempted to promote rural development through biofuel production, what social outcomes those strategies have created and what lessons can be learned. This is done by comparing the contexts of Brazil, India and Indonesia; three countries with important agricultural sectors that have put large-scale biofuel programmes in place. The analysis indicates a disparity between the social discourse and the adopted biofuel policy instruments. Benefits to the rural poor have been limited and far too often they have been left worse off after being incorporated into biofuel production chains under disadvantageous conditions. The paper argues that better outcomes depend on: building upon traditional livelihoods, rather than attempting to replace them; paying attention to the views, needs and interests of the rural poor; and inserting policy provisions that allow smallholders to climb up the value-chain, thus addressing inequality structures.

eldis:A42896;Guide to operating in areas of conflict for the oil & gas industry;;"This is a guide for companies working in the extractive industries, particularly in the oil and gas sectors and provides basic conflict management advice and guidance. Its objective is to save time, to protect resources and reputations, and to enhance the safety of employees and of the communities in which they do business.The guide presents tools for risk assessment and risk management in conflict settings, including:

    conflicts between companies and local communities which are directly related to the presence and operations of the companies themselves 
    wider social and political conflicts in which companies are not directly involved but which are very likely to impact on companies operating in such conflict environments

Part one covers risk assessment - potential risks, community impacts, and reputation and ethical dilemmas companies might encounter when seeking to invest in geographic regions of conflict, and when planning new investments in countries where companies have existing operations. This involves a three-step approach:

    traditional risk assessment – identifies whether and where conflict is likely within a geographic or political area, and if it is ongoing, post conflict, or potential conflict
    conflict analysis - identifies the nature and causes of the conflict
    conflict impact assessment (CIA) - identifies how investments or corporate activities will affect the potential or existing conflict and vice versa

Part two covers risk management - practical guidance on how to manage conflict in ways that do not compromise ethics and reputation, or contravene national laws and international norms and standards. Risk management approaches include:

    ‘do no harm’ in operations - looking at how corporate policies and practices affect the dynamics of a conflict, such as, recruitment, compensation and security
    ‘do something’ – investing in the company’s front-line and backup conflict management capacities; increasing conflict sensitivity of operations and of community outreach projects; and establishing early warning systems for areas prone to violent conflict
    ‘do something ++” - building external conflict management capacity, such as, supporting local and national conflict management resources; providing training; funding study tours to regions where successful conflict management has been achieved; and providing funding and/or technical assistance to national and/or international conflict resolution efforts

The guide suggests that these steps, when undertaken effectively, can assist companies to avoid costly mistakes by alerting them to existing or emerging conflict issues and by informing both investment decisions and successful conflict management strategies.

eldis:A64515;Impact of climate and land use changes on water and food security in Jordan: implications for transcending 'the tragedy of the commons';;Jordan is dominated by arid climate with limited arable land and water resources. This study focuses on crop production and water resources under trends of anticipated climate change and population growth to analyse how these affect water and food security in the country. It finds that recession of irrigated areas led to lesser food production and food security. Results indicate that climate change and population growth increase and intensify problems of water scarcity and food insecurity. The study underlines the need for adaptive measures to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on water resources and food security. It suggests that at decision-maker level the development of water resources to increase supply is a top priority. At the user level, adaptation measures should focus on managing the demand by increasing water use efficiency and the adoption of appropriate cropping patterns that consume less water and produce more food. ;J.

eldis:A13327;Land lease markets and agricultural efficiency: theory and evidence from Ethiopia;;This paper develops a theoretical model of land leasing that includes transaction costs, risk pooling motives and non-tradable productive inputs. It investigates the empirical implications of land contracts using data collected from four villages in Ethiopia.The paper shows that sharecropping is the dominant contract if transaction costs are negligible, but that a rental contract may arise if transaction costs decrease with increasing the tenant’s share of output. When this is the case, the theory predicts that area operated by tenants will be an increasing function of their land endowment and that fixed rental contracts will be more likely in situations where transaction costs are higher. The paper finds empirical support for these predictions in the villages studied. It also finds that input of labour per hectare is about 25% lower on sharecropped than on other land tenure types, but that the differences in total value of inputs, outputs and profits per hectare are statistically insignificant and relatively small in magnitude.The paper demonstrates that these results support the Marshallian argument that sharecropping reduces labour effort, but also support the “New School” perspective since the magnitude of the inefficiency is relatively small. A bigger source of inefficiency (and inequity) in the study villages appears to be the limited lease market for oxen services, together with credit constraints that limit the ability of land and oxen poor households to purchase oxen. ;"J.

eldis:A14114;Land reform and sustainable livelihoods in South Africa's Eastern Cape province;;"This paper examines the experiences of implementation of land reform policies in the Eastern Cape through a series of case studies.It looks at how attempts at redistribution, restitution and land tenure reform have resulted in a variety of models and approaches. The paper evaluates the pros and cons of each model, and discusses the challenge of developing a more integrated, livelihoods oriented approach.The study finds that while claiming to address livelihoods, alleviation of poverty and development of rural areas, the South African land reform programme has struggled to achieve this in practice, for various reasons.Main findings include:there is a lack of integration and coordination of programme areas; this can be related to the lack of a comprehensive rural development strategy at either provincial or national level. However, this is being addressed by the Department of Land Affairs (DLA) and Regional Land Claims Commission (RLCC) increasingly working with other government structures and carefully planning projects in ways that increasingly focus on livelihoods and sustainabilitycomplex governmental structures present a major challenge to land reform policy, in terms of policy design, inter institutional co operation and accountabilityin addition to DLA and RLCC, a range of other organisations are involved in land reform in the Eastern Cape and play a valuable role in shaping policythe delegation of responsibility to multi functional local government structures has allowed for the integration of land reform with other key policy areas, such as water and housing, to a degree that was not possible under single function line departments and provides a realistic basis for the promotion of sustainable livelihoodsdynamic NGOs, well-organised and articulate local communities and a variety of service providers from the private sector also play a vital role in the more successful land reform initiatives in the provincemany rural communities however, are loosely defined and poorly organised, loyalties are commonly divided between two types of local government, elected local authorities and traditional leaders, both of which struggle to provide effective leadership to rural communities and to access key reform programmeswork remains to be done in order to integrate sustainable livelihoods approaches into South African land reform, and rural development policy more generally, and to create a decentralised institutional framework that is accountable to local people and responsive to their needs.[adapted from author] ";E.

eldis:A72625;Topic Guide: Climate change, food security and agriculture;;"This Topic Guide addresses the threat that climate change poses to food security and poverty reduction achievements. The peer-reviewed guide explains how programming around climate-smart agriculture can help adapt and build resilience to climate change – at the same time stimulating economic growth and poverty reduction in the agricultural sector.

The main message from this Topic Guide is that climate change is already affecting food security and agricultural growth under all types of agriculture, and is expected to continue to have an increasingly serious impact on smallholders and large scale agriculture.

A well-considered approach that tackles both technical and structural issues in agriculture is essential, and can create a prosperous climate-resilient agricultural sector that enables inclusive growth.

Well-tailored packages of interventions can support dynamic farmers to take advantage of new markets and opportunities. Other interventions can support those whose poverty constrains them significantly. But in many countries, significant structural issues constrain smallholder agriculture and need to be resolved for agriculture to prosper. These include a complex range of context-specific issues such as favourable national policies, better access to knowledge, credit and investment for women and the poor or marginalised.

They also include ‘hard’ physical or technological issues of adequate infrastructure, access to farm inputs, improved technologies and markets. Within a world affected by climate change, it becomes ever more important that current science and early warning information are gathered and shared faster and better with

In spite of the formal arguments, the preparation processes face serious challenges in terms of a more genuine and commitment with the consultation processes with various stakeholders related to forestry, especially in the case of indigenous peoples and forest communities. While the process of preparing for REDD in Mesoamerica is recent, evidence of a rapid evolution is important and there is an urgent need for resolute commitment to openness and inclusion of stakeholders, which will be critical to greater legitimacy in the process of preparation and implementation of REDD + strategies.

eldis:A26394;The economic role of cattle in communal farming systems in Zimbabwe;;This paper is concerned with understanding cattle production in Zimbabwe's Communal Lands, in so-called communal farming systems. Although commercial offtake from Zimbabwe's communal cattle herd is low, communal farmers are productive and rational in their cattle herd management. The economic rationale for cattle ownership is firstly to provide draught power and manure for tillage and secondly to provide milk and meat for local consumption, although the role of livestock in the farming system varies significantly from one part of Zimbabwe to another. While cattle have social and cultural functions which are important these are generally secondary to economic functions.It is argued in this paper that the contribution of communal livestock to the national economy in Zimbabwe has not been fully recognised. A model of communal cattle production is presented below which leads to an estimate of the average value of output from communal cattle at just over Z$200 per year per animal. On this basis, the total output from the communal cattle herd in Zimbabwe is estimated to be about Z$800 million (US$250 million) in 1991, representing a very substantial contribution to the rural economy. The analysis has policy implications concerning prospects in the communal areas for: increasing commercial slaughter offtake, control of cattle numbers, cost-recovery for veterinary services, and improved planning and appraisal of veterinary programmes.The remainder of this section considers the characteristics of the communal farming sector in Zimbabwe, emphasising its heterogeneity and the consequent difficulty of making generalisations about it. Subsequent sections examine the various roles of cattle in Zimbabwe's Communal Lands, and then attempt to quantify and value the outputs of communal cattle, leading to an assessment of the contribution of these cattle to the national economy. The final part of the paper examines various policy implications which derive from this analysis. ;J. C.

eldis:A73681;Re-framing island nations as champions of resilience in the face of climate change and disaster risk.;;"This paper is part of a set of working papers that resulted from the Resilience Academy 2013-2014. The United Nations University Institute of Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) publishes these papers as part of its UNU-EHS Working Paper series.
It presents several multi-scale case studies from islands around the world to offer a historically informed review of the cultural, environmental, political and economic systems and influences on island resilience.
The discussion then shifts to the current state of vulnerable island populations, ecosystems and livelihoods, and opportunities for restoring and enhancing resilience through traditional and local knowledge and institutionalizing a long-term agenda to rebuild social and environmental justice. In doing so, this article demonstrates how small island communities can become inspiring champions of livelihood resilience to global environmental change.
The conclusions highlight best practices at the local, national and regional scales for addressing these challenges through education, women’s empowerment, health, intergenerational knowledge sharing, food security and innovative livelihood strategies such as varied mobility tactics.

eldis:A74008;Land-use planning and REDD+;;"Introduction and background.
The land sector is unique in climate mitigation as it is the only sector where both emissions and removals of carbon occur (including depletion of carbon sinks). Extensive and unsustainable land use patterns will have to be replaced by more sustainable, but intensive uses, if land-based emissions are to be reduced. Consequently, land and natural resource planning is a key starting point for REDD+ interventions worldwide. The plans may introduce considerable changes to land and forest use to reduce emissions, while also impacting local livelihoods. Participatory land use planning improves local participation as well as effective use of land.
In many cases, government or project supported natural resource management programmes undertake village land use plans as pure formalities, without any follow up on implementation. A land-use plan under a ‘business-as-usual ‘ scenario usually maximises the agriculture area, while only a small fraction of village land is reserved for forestry – often in a remote and poorly accessed area. This type of planning undermines the possibilities of managing the land for sustainable forest management (SFM) to support rural incomes; it also increases deforestation in some of the most densely forested areas in Tanzania. The Norwegian-funded REDD+ pilot projects showed that combining land-use planning, participatory forest management and enforcement of local by-laws can contribute to SFM and thereby reduce emissions, especially when tied to performance-based payments.

Key policy messages.
• Land-use planning is an important tool for tackling the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, such as shifting agriculture and insecurity of land tenure.
• Participatory land use planning at landscape and village level is crucial to the implementation of REDD+.  It ensures broad local participation in land use management decisions and gives the opportunity to address the challenges of sustainable production under different conditions.
• Land-use planning for REDD+ should be assisted at a landscape level with strong financial and political support from national and local government authorities. Introducing improved management across land under community management can avoid leakage as well as    develop    economies    of scale for land management and the marketing of carbon credits.
• Through Village Land Use Planning (VLUP) communities have an incentive to demarcate  and manage large forest areas due to the potential monetary and non-monetary benefits from REDD+.
• Linking VLUP to REDD+ performance based payments creates strong local incentives for the implementation of the plans.

eldis:A27870;Formalizing Informality: The Praedial Registration System in Peru;;"The Praedial Property Registration system has been presented as an alternative system to traditional registries for the formalization of immovable property. Much of the earlier design and pilot work for the Praedial Property Registration system was done by the Peruvian private organization, Instituto Libertad y Democracia (ILD). They claim that in Peru they ""have formalized over 150,000 properties much more quickly, and at dramatically less costs, than traditional titling and registration programs"" in three-and-a-half years during the early 1990s. This property formalization system has been trademarked as PROFORM. It is being offered to other countries as a quick and inexpensive way to convert informal property in the hands of a large proportion of the population into legally recognized private property, and as a source of capital for the grassroots development of these countries. This study assesses the functioning of this system in Peru and its replicability in other countries. There is no easily accessible documentation on how this property formalization program has actually functioned in Peru, and it is therefore difficult for development agencies to determine its applicability elsewhere. This assessment of the Registro Predial in Peru is an attempt to document the functioning of an important component of this formalization program. The study examines different aspects of property formalization and related institutions and processes. The scope of this assessment, therefore, includes not only the Registro Predial registration system, but also the titling process (prior to registration) and the credit worthiness and credit opportunities for titled and registered property in both urban and rural areas in Lima that fall under the jurisdiction of the Registro Predial. The study also examines the concepts and legal framework of titling, registration, ownership rights, and possession rights within the Peruvian context. [author] ";"S. Lastarria-Cornhiel

Tenancy for purposes of this review is broadly defined to include different leasing arrangements such sharecropping, labor tenancy, fixed cash rentals, and reverse leasing. Authors have limited our discussion to private leasing of agricultural land, thereby ignoring issues pertaining to leasing of public, forest, and other noncrop lands. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a basis for evaluation of the desirability, feasibility, and potential content of regulatory guidelines for lease agreements that might permit the land-lease market to operate effectively. The works discussed herein are both theoretical and empirical. Attempts to locate the most recent literature on tenancy for Asia, Africa, and Latin America. If contemporary literature is scarce or if historical developments are useful to understanding current tenancy trends, references and inclusion of recent past experiences and dynamics are included. As can be expected, the availability of studies on tenancy in the three regions is quite different. [author] ;"S. Lastarria-Cornhiel

eldis:A27872;The Reform of Rural Land Markets in Latin America and the Caribbean: Research, Theory, and Policy Implications;;"Summarizes recent research (to 1991) on rural land markets in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region and on the relationship between this research and broader land tenure issues. The purpose of the project that prompted this paper was to carry out cross-country and longitudinal research on land tenure issues in the LAC region so as to provide an instructive and informative analysis of how tenure patterns affect economic, rural development, and environmental issues. The project's principal research areas were: (1) tenure security through improved titling and land registration systems, (2) the potential for farmland markets to increase access to land, and (3) second-generation problems of existing agrarian reforms. This paper summarizes the research undertaken by the Land Tenure Center on the second of these research areas. The studies reviewed are exploratory and are designed to investigate how land markets work in order to develop projects and policies that will make the markets more open and efficient and more accessible to land-poor and landless farmers. The paper is in six parts. Following a general introduction and discussion of the broad schematic framework which guided the fieldwork, section 2 discusses the constraints to small farmer participation in rural land markets. Section 3 examines the country study research carried out under the project, while section 4 begins the process of putting these studies into the theoretical framework needed for future research and programs. Section 5 discusses potential land market interventions, and section 6 presents the conclusions derived from the paper.

eldis:A13973;Farming assets in North Wälo: statistics, maps and impressions from a travel to North Wälo, October 2000;;The report is based on information collected in the aftermath of the 1999 famine. It presents some basic information on North Wälo, as well as relevant impressions from the authors journey. Statistics from  the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission show that all of North Wälo is exposed to  famine, but the picture varies much from year to year. The famines in the late 1990s hit the bälg-producing highlands in particular, and in 2000 up to two thirds of the rural population was  registered as needy of relief in some districts.The report includes an account of a visit to Baba Säat, one of the most highly affected areas. It was a society in distress, but due to successful relief, people did not actually starve. Agricultural resources are scarce in North Wälo, and this is commonly identified as the root cause of famine. In fact  little is known about these resources and the local production system.The report presents available statistics and on this basis seeks to assess some common theories about causes of poverty and famine. The ‘ox argument’ is tentatively dismissed, since there appears to be enough oxen to plough the land. Land is a scarce resource, but data on farm holdings are very weak and can easily be misinterpreted. The juxtaposition of several source types show inconsistencies, the solution of which may significantly increase our understanding of the land tenure system. [author] ;"S. Ege

eldis:A75981;Smallholders at risk: monoculture expansion, land, food and livelihoods in Latin America;;"Greater investment in agriculture is needed to reduce rural poverty and improve food security; but how investment is made, its context and conditions, is at least as important as how much is invested.

Case studies of large-scale agricultural investment in Paraguay, Guatemala and Colombia show how monoculture expansion is displacing communities, undermining smallholder livelihoods and worsening local food security. Even when companies say they operate responsibly, their business model determines who bears the risks, who has access to capital and where market power lies. Responsibility should mean benefits and costs are fairly distributed and all rights upheld, including land rights. Private agricultural investment is needed, but it should complement rather than undermine smallholders, who are the main investors in agriculture.

eldis:A75980;A land title is not enough: ensuring sustainable land restitution in Colombia ;;"The violent struggle to control territory for economic, military and political reasons, coupled with high levels of rural poverty and the high concentration of land ownership among relatively few owners, has been one of the root causes of Colombia’s 50-year-old internal armed conflict. There has been an insatiable appetite amongst numerous actors in Colombia to gain and maintain control over land deemed critical to their varying interests. These actors include the security forces and paramilitaries (either acting alone or in collusion with each other), guerrilla groups, some political and business elites in the regions, drug traffickers and other criminal enterprises.

This has had a devastating impact on the millions of Colombians who traditionally rely on land for their survival, especially Indigenous, Afro-descendant and peasant farmer communities. It has led to the forced displacement of almost 6 million people – nearly 13% of Colombia’s population and one of the highest displacement levels in the world and the illegal acquisition of around 8 million hectares of land, some 14% of Colombia’s territory.

Most of those forcibly displaced in the course of the conflict had an association with the land from which they were forced to flee, in that they owned it or had customary rights over it, worked on it individually or communally, or had tenure or possession over it.

Large-scale infrastructure developments and the agro-industrial, agro-fuel and extractive industries, both domestic and international, have frequently benefited from forced displacement and land grabs, through the removal of communities from strategic areas earmarked for exploitation. This displacement has been primarily carried out by paramilitaries often operating in collusion with state security forces. Guerrilla forces have also threatened and killed civilians in the context of exploiting particular economic resources, often driving people from their lands as a consequence.

This report  provides a summary of the national and international legal human rights framework that should be underpinning the efforts of the Colombian state to return illegally acquired land to its rightful occupants and examines in detail the many obstacles that land claimants are still facing in their struggle to return home in a sustainable manner.

eldis:A68220;Building national forest and land-use information systems: Lessons from Cameroon, Indonesia, and Peru;;"This working paper, published by the World Resources Institute, looks at efforts in Cameroon, Indonesia, and Peru to invest in the infrastructure and capacity to track the impacts of changes from from forest and land-use-based climate change mitigation actions. The paper focuses on the development of forest and land-use information systems (FLUIS), specifically the institutional, human resources and financial capacities of the three countries. After introducing the topic, the paper focuses on each of the three country contexts, illustrating examples of FLUIS. The section discusses the history and current state of coordination between government agencies, and their efforts to develop and implement FLUIS prior to scaling-up efforts. The paper lays out lessons learned and recommendations, prior to the conclusion: 
 Secure high-level commitment from the government: In all three countries, the commitment to develop their respective FLUIS came from the Presidents office, whilst top-level commitments, and in the cases of Indonesia and Peru, legal mandates, helped inter-ministerial coordination.
 Bring all relevant agencies to the table: The overlap of logging permits in each country illustrates the necessity of integrating conflicting agency processes. Removing overlaps and conflicts through an institutional mapping exercise is key to maintaining an effective working relationship.
 Establish long-term financial support for the FLUIS through the policy framework - an iterative updating process should be maintained, with clearly defined roles and domestic budgetary inclusion.
 Retain institutional memory: A common struggle experienced with the functioning of FLUIS is retaining institutional memory. Efforts are progressing in Cameroon to include in their Interactive Forest Atlas a user-interface that streamlines data entry.
 Build sub-national capacity and coordination: All three countries have a growing role in data collection and implementation of forest policies. Initial efforts to implement provincial and district projects in Indonesia will need to be scaled up, with adequate financial and human resources capacities. 
The authors conclude that the deployment of FLUIS is not the end goal; but rather serves as a means for enabling tracking of mitigation policies and improving the collection and sharing of data. The initial phase of the project in each country was finance and capacity-intensive, and more is needed to ensure development of the system beyond the development phase. Key to this progress is pinpointing fundamental capacity gaps that prevented integration and management of forest data. ";"L. Cheung

eldis:A35926;Biofuels, climate change and GM crops: who is really benefiting?;;"Biofuels are attracting increased attention and investment as an alternative to fossil-based fuels and a means of combating climate change, yet there are many critics. This one-page briefing explores some of the concerns surrounding biofuels and the limitations posed by large-scale biofuel production.
Key points highlighted include the following:

    ambitious targets held by industrialised nations have placed demands on developing countries to provide crops for biofuel, especially maize
    it is not clear whether developing nations can benefit from large-scale biofuel production as growing crops for biofuel can take up land and water currently used for domestic food production and as a result, can drive up prices of crop staples. 
    biofuels have limitations as a source of  “clean” energy
    there are many concerns about the use of genetically modified (GM) bacteria and enzymes to break down plant waste and convert it to biofuels are particularly prominent. 

The authors conclude that, before trying to meet global fuel demands via biofuel production in developing countries, the governments in each country must first answer the following questions: 

    Will the biofuel industry in developing countries support local energy needs,or just meet the demands of richer nations? 
    Will biofuel crops displace domestic food production? 
    Are there laws and controls in place to track any GM organisms used to produce biofuels? 
    Has there been any public discussion about GM crops, and which issues do people consider the most important? 
    What limits are there to ensure that expanding the area of cultivated land does not damage natural ecosystems?

eldis:A40430;Guidelines for applying protected area management categories;;"The IUCN protected area management categories are a global framework, recognised by the Convention on Biological Diversity, for categorising the variety of protected area management types. The following guidelines provide direction, descriptions, principles and advice in the application of the IUCN protected area management categories in particular biomes and management approaches.The document is broken into different sections focusing on key discussions on IUCN protected area management, which are included below. 

    What does IUCN’s mean by “protected area” and what is the purpose behind the categories? Each category is described by its main objective, distinguishing features, role in the landscape or seascape, unique points and actions that are compatible or incompatible
    Although categories are independent of who owns, controls, or has responsibility for management, governance is still very important. Governance types by government bodies, indigenous peoples, communities and private bodies are identified in order to help in understanding, planning for and recording protected areas.
    What processes are used for applying categories?The discussion looks at: choosing and agreeing the most suitable category for a given situation; assigning the category to meet national and international standards; and recording the protected area and category with the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre
    Protected areas embrace a huge range of biomes, ownership patterns and motivations. Specific cases are looked at in more detail where in the past there has been cause of confusion on the management objectives set and the subsequent categories that are then applied. Examples include: forests, sacred natural sites, freshwater areas, etc.
    How do Ramsar and the World Heritage conventions relate to the IUCN categories?
    Effectiveness of categories - options are examined as to ways of assessing protected areas that are failing to meet their objective in their category more effective.

eldis:A37031;Land reform in South Africa: getting back on track;;"The injustices of the land issue in South Africa under apartheid are well documented. A programme of land reform since then has had varied success. The authors argue that there is a great deal of empirical evidence to show that the private sector and markets make major contributions to South Africa’s development in general and to land reform in particular. It is in this light that this report looks at the contribution made by the private sector to land reform, both through organised land reform initiatives and in the ordinary course of their business. It examines cases in the Western and Eastern Cape regions, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga and focuses on the agri-business sectors of fruit, timber and sugar production.The following key findings are highlighted:

    urbanisation has meant that rural and agricultural needs are often neglected - policy must identify and assist those willing and able to farm
    any successful land reform programme must include the identification and release of urban and peri-urban land for settlement, housing and job creation, as well as reform of ownership and use of land suitable for farming
    a high degree of decentralisation of both policy development and implementation is required for successful land reform
    ownership structures need to facilitate economic activity and much greater post-settlement support is needed, as is much more complete integration of black farmers into the established farming community
    the slow pace of processing and settling the remaining land restitution claims is creating uncertainty, delaying investment, and generally having negative impacts on agricultural production.

eldis:A32203;Adaptation to climate change by small-scale Rooibos tea farmers in Wupperthal and the Suid Bokkeveld areas of the Western and Northern Cape;;"The project aims to support small-scale farmers in the project area in their efforts to adapt their farming practices to anticipated climate change and to enhance their incomes. 
It also aims to inform policy makers and implementers (at all levels of government), land users, scientists and development facilitators of the causes and impacts of climate change, and of appropriate adaptation measures and to enable government agencies at all levels (local, provincial and national) to effectively support adaptation to climate change and sustainable resource use in the project area and elsewhere. 
Since rural women are among the most vulnerable land users we will also create specific programmes for dealing with their needs. 
The direct beneficiaries of the project will be the farmers’ households in the 2 communities. By researching (by using scientific studies that will include the participation of the small-scale farmers) the likelihood and/or success of wild rooibos tea propagation (this strain of the rooibos species is more weather-hardy and resistant to adverse climatic conditions) as either a supplement or replacement of the cultivated variety, in the context of changing climatic conditions, the farmers will enhance their adaptive capacity by having insight and informed knowledge bases in order to make further ‘adaptive’ livelihood decisions that will include improved natural resource management.

eldis:A75989;Contestations over indigenous participation in Bolivia’s extractive industry: ideology, practices, and legal norms ;;"The participatory rights of indigenous peoples have been at the center of conflicts over resource extraction, which have recently increased in number and intensity across Latin America. Using comprehensive empirical data about the Guaraníes’ participation in Bolivia’s gas sector, this study finds that competing claims regarding territory, property, participation, and decision making provide important explanations for contestations over consultation practices and legal norms in the country.

It argues that the main conflicts can be explained by:


	the Bolivian state’s focus on directly affected communities and those with formally recognized land titles, something that clashes with the Guaraníes’ principle of “territorial integrity”
	the state’s conviction that it holds a monopoly over subsoil resources, and the limited rights to participation that it is willing to grant as a consequence, which the Guaraníes reject; and
	the dissonance between state customs and regulations and Guaraní uses and customs

eldis:A68227;What drives deforestation and what stops it? A meta-analysis of spatially explicit econometric studies;;"This paper presents a meta-analysis of what drives deforestation and what stops it. The researchers find that forests are more likely to be cleared where economic returns to agriculture and pasture are higher, either due to more favorable climatological and topographic conditions, or due to lower costs of clearing forest and transporting products to market. It is argued that timber activity, land tenure security, and community demographics do not show a consistent association with either higher or lower deforestation. Population is consistently associated with greater deforestation, and poverty is consistently associated with lower deforestation, but in both cases endogeneity makes a causal link difficult to infer. Promising approaches for stopping deforestation include reducing the intrusion of road networks into remote forested areas; targeting protected areas to regions where forests face higher threat and tying rural income support to the maintenance of forest resources through payments for ecosystem services.

eldis:A64351;Land grabs and fragile food systems: The role of globalization;;"IATP have consistently argued that trade agreements need to respect and promote human rights, not drive a process of globalisation that privileges commercial interests and pushes public interests aside. This paper concludes that the globalisation enshrined in the free trade and investment agreements of the 1990s and 2000s have led to yet another manifestation of commercial interests trampling human rights - namely land grabs. This paper is specifically focuses on two forces that IATP argue have contributed significantly to the problem: First, globalisation—more specifically, the deregulation of trade and foreign investment laws, which has greatly eased cross-border capital flows, relaxed the limits on foreign land ownership, and opened markets to agricultural imports. And second, the failures of the international trading system during the food price crisis of 2007-08, which eroded the confidence of food import–dependent countries in international markets as a reliable source of food and fed both speculative investment and investment in actual food production. This loss of confidence was compounded by climate change and the resulting destabilisation of weather patterns, which has resulted in less predictable agricultural production. 
Whilst investment in agriculture is welcomed the impact of land grabs has been overwhelmingly negative. They are associated with weak institutional capacity (and sometimes corruption) in the recipient country governments, as well as authoritarian governments in the investors’ home countries, making it hard to bring pressure there for better practices. The communities whose land is leased or bought are not adequately protected. Four linked policy shifts to create a more stable and transparent international food system are needed: 

    reformed trade rules that ensure export measures are subject to transparency and predictability requirements and that allow all countries policy space for food security policies
    publicly-managed grain reserves to dampen the effects of supply shocks
    readily accessible funding for the poorest food importers, which would be triggered automatically when prices increase sharply in international markets
    the development of strong national and international laws to govern investment in land, respecting the principles and guidelines set out in the Voluntary Guidelines on Land Tenure.

eldis:A11425;Civil society and the land question in Tanzania;;"The Land Policy in Tanzania is an example of citizens engaging in a protracted struggle for effective participation in the policy process, despite the long exclusion they have experienced in policy making. This paper looks at the evolution of the policy, and the interactions between civil society and the state in its development.The paper concludes that this was the first serious and systematic civic organizations' challenge to the state command model of policy process. Citizens' struggle for participation in the policy process paid off as a number of adjustments were made to the Bill which otherwise would not have been made.  Putting gender on the agenda of the Land Bill debate is a significant achievement. Another outcome mentioned was that there was a slight shift in government attitudes toward civil organizations. Senior officials from the ministry responsible for land, including the Commissioner for land, attended meetings organized by the Task Force and answered questions from participants.The fact that the enactment of the Land Law was delayed for more than two years shows organized citizens are a power to reckon with in the policy process. It also shows that the state can no longer ride high in matters that are of deep concern on the part of the citizens. Moreover, the process equipped citizens with confidence, new strategies and experience of dealing with the state in the policy process.However, the process has also identified weaknesses in the functioning of civil society in the process. Given the task that was before the members of the NGO groups, very few people had a clear vision and strategy towards the issues to which the National Land Forum concerned itself with. There was a clear problem of disunity in purpose created by the presence of two distinct groups: one group advocating for general land rights to Tanzanians; the other group advocating on land rights for women (youth and children). Whilst the focus of the campaign was initially on the people, as time went by, this moved to the mobilization of support from parliamentarians and legal draftspersons. The author concludes that this weakened the process, and greatly affected the results of the campaign. ";E. T.

eldis:A101035;Links between tenure security and food security in poor agrarian economies: causal linkages and policy implications;;Population growth leads to growing land scarcity and landlessness in poor agrarian economies. Many of these also face severe climate risks that may increase in the future. Tenure security is important for food security in such countries and at the same time threatened by social instability that further accelerate rural-urban and international migration. Provision of secure property rights with low-cost methods that create investment incentives can lead to land use intensification and improved food security. Pro-active policies that engage youth in establishment of sustainable livelihoods hold promise. Social and political stability are essential for tenure security and food security. ;"S. T. Holden

eldis:A101910;Can the land rental market facilitate smallholder commercialization? Evidence from northern Ethiopia;;The paper utilizes household panel data to investigate whether the land rental market can facilitate improved access to land for land-poor tenant households over time and thereby facilitate expansion of their farming activity. The paper utilizes data 8-17 years after land certification to assess the long-term effect of land certification on the allocative efficiency in the land rental market in areas where land certification stimulated land renting in the early years after certification. The paper uses three rounds of balanced panel data collected from 320 smallholder farmers in 2006, 2010 & 2015 from rural Tigrai, northern Ethiopia. Random effects dynamic probit and Tobit models were used to assess factors that may explain access, participation, and intensity of participation on the tenant side of the tenancy market. Tenants’ access to land was found to be severely constrained. Previous access and participation had strong positive effect on access and participation and intensity of participation in later periods. Non-convex transaction costs and entry barriers, therefore, appear as severe constraints towards the land rental market facilitating smallholder commercialization through tenancy access to land. More active land rental market coordination interventions are needed to boost the land rental market as a vehicle for facilitation of smallholder commercialization. ;"M. Gebru

eldis:A63376;Can REDD+ save the forest? The role of payments and tenure;;The success of REDD+ depends on whether it can be economically viable and if any resulting payments are sufficient to cover the opportunity cost plus any transaction cost. Where tenure security over forested areas is weak, REDD+ can pose a risk for forest communities, who could be dispossessed, excluded and marginalised. This review explores how payment for avoided deforestation and forest tenure impact the success of REDD+ projects in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and equity. Effectiveness refers to the difference between deforestation with and without REDD+, efficiency refers to avoiding deforestation at minimal cost, and equity refers to the implication of REDD+ on benefit sharing. The study concludes that the potential success or failure of REDD+ as a means to reduce deforestation and carbon emission on forest commons depends on designing projects that work within existing informal tenure institutions to ensure that carbon storage benefits align with livelihood benefits. ;E.B.

eldis:A42393;Land tenure and land management in the districts around Mount Elgon: an assessment presented to Mount Elgon Regional Ecosystem Conservation Programme (MERECP);;" 
    This working paper reviews historical and current factors and patterns affecting land use, land tenure, resource access, human settlement, and conflicts over resource access and tenure in the districts around Mt. Elgon in Kenya and Uganda. The paper draws on a series of interviews conducted with government officials in the districts along with other support sources such as paper maps and existing GIS databases.Based on this approach, the common findings from this study in the current setting of land tenure and land management are:
    
            complex historical processes have led to the current state of land management in the two countries
            land policies in both countries (Kenya’s free hold tenure and Uganda’s customary land tenure) have not resolved and will not resolve the land issues they were intended to address (such as low economic growth and agricultural production)
            spatial differences in the Mt. Elgon area are the results of complex issues related to history, ethnicity and tradition, farming practices and development projects
            emerging problem areas are landlessness, settlement conflicts, insecurity, fragmentation of farmland and small land size due to population pressure affecting land management, lack of tenure rights in practice (tree tenure and land rights) to women, conversion of customary land tenure into freehold, resource access to forest products (Kenya), and non-functional of land offices (Uganda).
    
    The set of recommendations for modifying and harmonising policies and institutions - effective at the local level promoting sustainable land management in this area - are:
    
            freehold and customary land tenure system in this area are successful if the system is administered with principles of good planning, equity and transparency
            improve the livelihoods and biodiversity by diversification
            call for a total change in attitudes within families and communities
            equate land rights for both men and women as legitimised owners
            participation of communities and other stakeholders in promoting the management of forests
            more scientific approaches to be called for in establishing sustainable levels of resource extraction.

eldis:A73504;Food & Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture - ROSA : Land Tenure And Gender: Approaches And Challenges For Strengthening Rural Women's Land Rights | capacity4dev;;"Land tenure security is crucial for women's empowerment and a prerequisite for building secure and resilient communities. Tenure is affected by many and often contradictory sets of rules, laws, customs, traditions, and perceptions. For most rural women, land tenure is complicated, with access and ownership often layered with barriers present in their daily realities: discriminatory social dynamics and strata, unresponsive legal systems, lack of economic opportunities, and lack of voice in decision making. Yet most policy reform, land management, and development programs disregard these realities in their interventions, which ultimately increases land tenure insecurity for rural women. This paper seeks to further develop the evidence base for access to and control over land.

eldis:A15762;Copenhagen Consensus: challenge paper on population and migration;;"Many countries receiving migrants are attempting to manage immigration by discouraging potential migrants through tighter controls and restrictions of benefits. This paper argues that this is not an optimal solution. Rather, the overall goal is to create a world in which migration is unnecessary because sufficient opportunity exists at home. The majority of people do not migrate, and they will only enjoy higher incomes if their countries prosper. The challenge is to ensure that the migration of the exceptional few also improves conditions for those who stay behind.The paper finds that global GDP is increased by the higher incomes received by most migrant workers. Receiving countries also receive a small net benefit to their economies. Countries of origin benefit significantly from remittances and, in some cases, the return of migrants to their native land.Three opportunities to ensure that migration aids more people are assessed in the paper, all of which could be implemented in the next 5 to 15 years. The paper argues that these would each raise the benefits and reduce the costs of migration, most of which would probably occur anyway. They include:active selection systems to allow in those foreigners who are most likely to succeed. This would reduce fears of immigration and allow wider entry channels to be opened for skilled workers and professionals. To ensure that the local labour pool is properly searched in this demand-based system, employers could be required to pay a fee to employ migrants. The mechanism for the liberalisation of the temporary movement of workers (initially professionals, later unskilled) on a global basis, would be a visa issued under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Two potential downsides to these procedures would be that the already high costs of curbing unwanted and unlawful immigration may rise and selecting the brightest and best from developing countries could increase inequality and migration pressures. Some compensatory mechanism, such as exit taxes or continued taxation of migrants by their countries of origin, might alleviate thiswidening legal entry channels for unskilled guest workers, together with encouragement to return to their countries of origin. This would provide temporary labour without permanent settlement. Potential mechanisms include encouraging short-term legal employment through appropriate tax and subsidy regimes, repaying migrant workers' social security payments when they return to their countries of origin, and having irregular workers earn legal status by registering and completing employment and tax requirementsusing the 3 R's of migration (recruitment, remittances and returns) to accelerate growth over time. Benefits from the 3 R's would be maximised if countries adopted economic policies likely to foster growth. These would include developing countries setting realistic exchange rates and trade liberalisation, where host countries ceased protecting their uncompetitive agricultural industries.The paper concludes that the benefits of migration (higher incomes) are immediate and easy to see; the costs are delayed and very difficult to estimate. The opportunities listed above, however, would allow the realisation of more benefits from migration, reducing inequalities between countries in the longer term. Lowering barriers to migration should rank very high on the global list of challenges. [adapted from author] ";P.

eldis:A101951;A land grab for pulp- new mill project by Portucel Mozambique;;This latest discussion document explores the plan by The Navigator Company to develop a new pulp mill in Mozambique. The Portuguese company, operating as Portucel Mozambique and with funding from the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, is acquiring huge areas of land for establishing eucalyptus tree plantations to supply the mill. Local NGOs monitoring the impacts of this land acquisition are deeply concerned about the impacts on local livelihoods and on biodiversity.The report explains exactly where the land grab is taking place and includes testimony from farmers who have lost the land they depend upon for subsistence in exchange for short-term work or inferior land in remote places. The report casts doubt on whether Free, Prior and Informed Consent was granted the company in its rush to establish pulp plantations. The report also analyses the environmental risks and impacts of the project, which will convert biodiverse miombo woodland habitat to monoculture plantation.The Environmental Paper Network welcome discussion and feedback on the report and hope that potential investors and other stakeholders in the project will read it and demand robust solutions to the problems it raises.The document is also available in Portuguese. ;;Environmental Paper Network;Environmental Paper Network;eldis;01/11/2017;en;"food security;land grabbing;environment;land;land grabs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";;MOZ;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A101951;http://www.environmentalpaper.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/171117-Discussion-Document-Portucel-Report-2017-English.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.environmentalpaper.eu%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F171117-Discussion-Document-Portucel-Report-2017-English.pdf;;Open - Other;;"forestry deforestation;Environment and Forestry;Environment and natural resource management;land grabbing;Environment;Food security;land grabs;pulp and  paper industry;Environment and water;biodoversity"
eldis:A72198;Environmental and socioeconomic impacts of Mexico's payments for ecosystem services program;;"This document summarizes current findings from an evaluation of Mexico’s National Payments for Hydrological Services from 2003-2010.  Th evaluation seeks to understand the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the program, with the goal of extracting lessons learned and identifying room for possible future improvement.

Findings: an analysis of program selection criteria and the characteristics of lands enrolled suggests the program has met the dual goals of targeting funds to areas of ecological and social priority. Specifically:


	on average, land enrolled over all years between 2004 and 2010 had similar risk of deforestation, higher hydrological priority and similar degree of marginality to all forested lands in the country. That is to say, land which was enrolled was broadly representative of available land
	looking at the evolution of the program over time, targeting to high deforestation risk and more marginalized areas has improved substantially between 2004 and 2010 due to changes in the program rules and the eligible zones resulting in the selection of higher risk and more poor recipients from within the applicant pool.


One potential means of improving the ecological impact of the program would be to select properties with even higher risk of deforestation, as the average risk of deforestation among enrolled properties remains somewhat below the national average across all forested lands.

Two possible ways to do this would be to target further on the basis of multiple characteristics which determine avoided deforestation (in addition to INE’s risk numbers) or to raise the payment amounts.

eldis:A23826;Policies and strategies to address the vulnerability of pastoralists in Sub-Saharan Africa;;This paper makes a case for increased policy attention to pastoralists in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The paper presents:estimates of the numbers of agro-/pastoral populations globallytheir livestock and their contribution to national economiesthe incidence of poverty among agro-/pastoral populations.The author examines the causes and dynamics of poverty among pastoral populations in Africa drawing on the sustainable livelihoods framework and focusing on vulnerability to shocks. Traditional livelihood and risk-management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective and pastoralists progressively more vulnerable to droughts, market exclusion, epidemics and violent conflicts, as well as being negatively affected by increasing human and livestock pressure on fragile drylands.The key policy question identified is whether it is preferable to invest in pastoral development or whether it is more appropriate to support exit- strategies for pastoralists. The report argues for a complementary strategy. On the one hand, pastoralism is the best, if not the only, means to make productive and sustainable use of natural resources in arid and semi-arid areas while on the other hand increasing human and livestock pressure on the drylands needs to be addressed by strategies that support adoption of alternative income generation activities by some agro-/pastoral people.The final part of the paper examines some policy options to sustain pastoral development. The main focus is on policies mitigating vulnerability of pastoral people to shocks. A review of policy responses by various countries in SSA shows some interesting and innovative approaches including:effective drought management policies and the adaptation of pastoral people to market opportunities in Kenyacost-effective policies in Chad which combine animal and human health service delivery to pastoral people in remote areasthe incorporation of specific pastoral livelihood and employment promotion issues into the national employment policy in Tanzania.The report urges decision-makers to continue experimenting and to refine and adapt policies to the specific features of the different pastoral situations. ;N.

eldis:A64857;EITI and sustainable development: Lessons and new challenges for the Caspian region;;"The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is sparking renewed interest and debate on issues such as transparency of government – company contracts, reporting on revenues from natural resources by company and by project, and reporting on revenue expenditure. An overarching concern is how to ensure that revenue transparency ultimately leads to better sustainable-development outcomes, including socio-economic development, poverty reduction and environmentally responsible extractive-industry practices.This discussion paper highlights key issues and new challenges related to EITI implementation, as well as broader issues of transparency and good governance in the extractive industries.  The paper is based on a series of dialogues relating to transparency and good governance in the Caspian Sea Region:

    Azerbaijan – the first country globally to become EITI Compliant
    Kazakhstan – an EITI Candidate country seeking to become Compliant
    and Turkmenistan – which is not a signatory of EITI but has expressed some interest in learning about the initiative

Recommendations from the Caspian dialogues include the following:

    provide further strategic, administrative and technical support for disaggregated reporting of payments to governments (e.g. company-by- company and project-by-project)
    identify current and potential ways in which the EITI process can contribute to accountability and sustainability in host countries and support relevant research on these linkages
    develop guidance on good practice in sub-national reporting, and support pilot initiatives, such as reporting on public monitoring of community development spending
    prioritise capacity building as an essential part of the EITI agenda, especially for local government and CSOs at the sub-national level
    ensure clarity in new rules and procedures, to strengthen minimum requirements and avoid any ambiguity that allows too much flexibility in implementation
    develop self-evaluation criteria and processes for EITI, such as progress ranking among member countries, based on competitive and motivational indicators

The research data summarized within the brief was gathered using a method known as Fair and Efficient REDD Value Chain Allocation (FERVA). The FERVA analysis is used to capture the perceptions and expectations of REDD stakeholders at the preliminary stages of REDD initiatives; it also informs stakeholders of the different functions of the REDD value chain. The brief ends with a call for complementary research to focus on REDD value chain analysis; ideally, this would include an examination of the way in which time, cost, technical capacities and governance implications impact upon the different functions of the value chain. It is argued that research should also work towards establishing a minimum project threshold for local-level benefits, such as contributions to livelihoods.

eldis:A64581;Sustainable wetland management in the face of climate risks in Niger: the case of La Mare de Tabalak;;"The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) recently implemented climate risk management studies in seven countries. This report, commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme’s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, gives a detailed summary of efforts in a Niger wetland environment to conduct one such study, incorporating climate change with three key sectors: agriculture, livestock and water resources. A number of workshops, consultations, capacity building exercises and working group meetings preceded and comprised the studies' implementation, including interviews, focus groups, socioeconomic questionnaires, field surveys and hydrological modelling. The wetlands of La Mare de Tabalak were chosen as the study site for its social, cultural, economic and environmental importance, and its vulnerability to climate change. It also had data available and a closed water system; a large pond that would fill in the wet season providing a number of roles for the community. This report contextualises the study with a development and climate profile, and the climate risks and impacts for the specific wetland. It then describes the existing national institutions, policies and initiatives. The report highlights that coordinated action is imperative to protect the pond and the wider-basin. The following recommendations are provided: 

    promote diversification of revenue-generating activities
    create an ongoing system to monitor and survey environmental and socioeconomic conditions 
    environmental restoration must be accelerated to extend the lifespan of the pond and curb erosion and silting
    diversification of livelihoods requires continued support to ensure access to natural resources
    outreach, training and knowledge/technology sharing must all be used to build the capacity of actors at all levels
    governance is advised to finalise and adopt the national wetlands policy, and to consolidate efforts and develop synergies between this and existing policies. 

The report closes with a note on areas for further research, including the need for a gender analysis, a survey of the pond’s bathymetry curve, socioeconomic scenarios and the impact of reservoir infrastructure on sediment transport to the pond. ";"J. Dekens

eldis:A22956;Policies and practices for securing and improving access to land;;"This paper reviews recent policy and practice to secure access to land for poor people. Emphasis is on Africa, Latin America and Asia, while reference also is made to Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.Despite the widely different observations from the various places, the paper identifies some general trends and challenges. These include: pressure on land is set to increase over future decades, given the impact of continued population growth, urbanisation, globalisation of markets, and climate change;
 as resources become scarcer and more valuable, those with weak rights to the resource tend to lose out.The paper argues that addressing land access and tenure security for these groups is crucial for social justice, sustainable livelihoods, political stability and peaceful co-existence. Secure land rights are also important for promoting rural development as it helps create conditions that encourage local and foreign investments. These issues should therefore be at the forefront in policy dialogue, PRSPs, macroeconomic policy at national level, and in the MDGs at the global level.While lessons can be shared between countries, the land reform agenda must be driven and owned by the individual country. Effective reform of land and property rights to support the livelihoods of the poor also requires sustained, long-term, commitment from governments and development agencies. Successful land reforms depend upon the exercise of strong political power allied to land reform movements, jointly prepared to challenge resistance by vested land interests. Capable and well-informed civil society organisations also play an important role in informing, and providing checks and balances on government decision-making and the development and implementation of land policy. Finally, a shortage of skilled personnel in government agencies, and lack of legal awareness amongst the general public combine to render land administration services largely inaccessible for ordinary people.The paper outlines a number of tools needed for securing land rights for the poor and vulnerable. These include:
 support for democratic land institutions and land information systems that are decentralised, problem centred and open to public scrutiny;
 effective links between new institutions and existing local mechanisms for managing land;
 improved systems for resolving land disputes, including formal, alternative dispute resolution and customary procedures.

eldis:A75026;Multimarket modeling of agricultural supply when crop land is a quasi-fixed input: a note ;;"Modeling of crop supply frequently adopts separate treatment of area and yield variables. The advantage of this approach is that it conveniently imposes the property of land being a quasi-fixed factor, at least on the aggregate. Given an agricultural land frontier, total supply of land may be fixed in the short run. Various crop multi-market models either ignore this property, thus foregoing the advantage of the area x yield formulation, or impose the aggregate land constraint in an ad hoc fashion.

This note proposes a parsimonious area x yield framework of agricultural supply that is firmly rooted in optimization and requires minimal priors for

eldis:A12531;Caffeine and conservation;;Overproduction of coffee and low coffee prices have resulted in a global crisis affecting the people and biodiversity of many tropical countries. The authors, from the Wildlife Conservation Society in Indonesia, describe expanding production of low-quality robusta coffee, which contributes to low prices and lowland deforestation, but is not improving the livelihood of local farmers. They argue that further increased coffee production will increase deforestation in national parks and disproportionately affect Sumatran tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses.The authors argue for new certification guidelines, better protected area enforcement, improved agricultural practices, and a reduction in area planted in coffee as critical for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.[Adapted from authors] ;"T.

eldis:A75126;Property rights reform in Philippine agriculture: framework for analysis and review of recent experience;;"This paper constructs a framework for and reviews studies on property rights reforms in the agricultural and natural resources sector. In the case of agrarian reform, several hypotheses are posited: that agrarian reform will increase the rate of capital accumulation of beneficiaries and improve tenurial security, but may have negative impacts on land access, investments of landowners, and efficiency of land use. For the natural resources sector, the implications of open access and promotion of property rights are surveyed for the Philippine case. Overall, the review finds that research work is scanty and not clearly generalizable to the national level, even for such a major and longstanding program as agrarian reform. Future research thrusts are enumerated in terms of the issues and hypotheses identified in this review.

eldis:A27905;Rethinking the Causes of Deforestation: Lessons from Economic Models;;Synthesizes the results of more than 140 economic models analyzing the causes of  tropical deforestation. Raises significant doubts about many conventional hypotheses in the debate about    deforestation. More roads, higher agricultural prices, lower wages, and a shortage of off-farm employment  generally lead to more deforestation. How technical change, agricultural input prices, household income  levels, and tenure security affect deforestation—if at all—is unknown. The role of macroeconomic factors such as population growth, poverty reduction, national income, economic growth, and foreign debt is also ambiguous. This review, however, finds that policy reforms included in current economic liberalization and adjustment efforts may increase the pressure on forests. Although the boom in deforestation modeling has yielded new insights, weak methodology and poor quality data make the results of many models questionable. [author] ;"A. Angelsen

Responding to this challenge requires efforts to improve policy makers understanding and ability to effectively manage existing and future risks. This guidebook provides operational guidance on how to manage the risk of floods in a transforming urban environment and climate. It argues for a strategic approach to managing flood risk, in which appropriate measures are identified, assessed, selected and integrated in a process that both involves and informs the full range of stakeholders. The guide presents 12 key principles for integrated urban flood risk management, illustrating key policy messages with over 50 case studies on management measures and procedures from across the world. ;A.

eldis:A27575;What Role for Tropical Forests in Climate Change Mitigation? The Case of Costa Rica;;Land and forestry-based activities could in principle play important roles as climate change mitigation strategies. In practice, however, several questions have been raised about their feasibility. Therefore, understanding the processes and determinants of land use changes is critical. This paper aims to contribute to such understanding in the larger part of a larger project on sustainable development and economic growth. It begins with a dynamic model of land use. The model generates deforestation equations that are estimated from data in Costa Rica on land use, environment, and geography, and, in the case of geo-referenced information, from secondary data. Results suggest that susceptibility to deforestation depends on environmental, geographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Such results may be of use in establishing baselines. The next stage of this work will add variables such as land value in order to permit the analysis of the effects of payments for carbon sequestration. Even in its current state, the model’s results can be linked to carbon storage and accumulation functions in order to quantify the supply of carbon offsets by Costa Rica resulting from changes in land use.

eldis:A27574;Deforestation and Land Use on the Evolving Frontier: An Empirical Assessment [in Nicaragua];;"The advance of the agricultural frontier constitutes the biggest source of deforestation in Central America today. This conversion of tropical forests into agricultural land and pasture is the direct result of individual land use decisions. This paper presents a simple analytical model of household land use, followed by an econometric analysis of household survey data from the Río San Juan region of Nicaragua in order to test for consistency with the model. The results of the analysis are consistent with the theory that in frontier regions where factor markets function poorly, constraints on household resources drive patterns of land use. In particular, the increased access to financial resources instigates a transition from low-intensity agricultural production into more extensive cattle ranching, exacerbating deforestation. The preliminary conclusions of this paper suggest that there are no win-win solutions on the agricultural frontier; policy instruments that increase incomes in remote rural regions will exacerbate deforestation.[author] ";R.

eldis:A27571;Liberal Contracts, Relational Contracts and Common Property: Africa and the United States;;The core thesis is that Western neoclassical economics and law (particularly Anglo-American) have a peculiar cultural history that biases Western-trained economists and lawyers against common property systems like those found among Africans and American Indians. This Western cultural bias is expressed through the recurrent focus on individuals as atomistic and independent of each other in contract and property law, as well as in economic theory. The bias derives in part from the historical suppression of community property rights that once overlapped individual property rights, as in the case of the enclosure of the commons in England. Well-meaning Western advisors may depart for foreign communities that possess common property systems and year after year, decade after decade, century after century, propose the replacement of existing legal and economic ideas and institutions with Western imports-not realizing the limited utility and contested history, even in the West, of these imported forms. While many of these issues are not new, the oldness of these debates becomes an issue in itself. How does one break the repetitive cycle, the cultural reproduction of bias, by provoking self-assessment? [author]African material include Guinea case study ;D.

eldis:A42248;Why is land productivity lower on land rented out by female landlords?: theory, and evidence from Ethiopia;;"There is a common view and belief that women are the ones that do the farming in Africa while the men do not work much. This paper seeks to find explanations to why land productivity is lower on land rented out by female landlord households than on land rented out by male landlord households in the Ethiopian highlands. The authors find that female landlords have tenants who are older, own less oxen, are more related, and under longer-term contracts. In the parametric regressions land productivity was significantly lower on plots rented out to in-law tenants and this appeared to explain the gender productivity differential. The authors show how female landlords may be forced to rent their land to their inlaws and they are unable to evict them even if they are inefficient land users. Land reforms that strengthen women’s land rights may therefore be good for efficiency as well as equity. Recent land regulations restricting renting out of land to maximum half of the farm area may contribute to weaken women’s land rights as a large share of the poor female landlords currently rent out more than half of their land because they lack the necessary non-land resources to farm efficiently. The following conclusions are identified: 

    female landlords face higher tenure insecurity and have lower bargaining power. This leads to poorer screening and selection ability, poorer quality tenants and lower resource rents
    strengthening women’s land rights may not only be good for equity but also for efficiency of land use
    there is a new regulation that only up to half of the land owned can be rented out. At present it is often violated however if this regulation is implemented strongly, it will contribute to more tenure insecurity for the poorest landlords that often are female-headed households.

eldis:A12889;Assessment of rural poverty: Asia and the Pacific;;This report argues that land reform, both tenancy reform and redistribution of ceiling surplus lands to the landless, is important to poverty alleviation.The paper argues that in addition to production benefits, land reform helps to change the local political structure by giving more voice to the poor. Re-distributive land reform, whether through market-assisted land reform programmes or otherwise, should remain a substantive policy issue for poverty reduction.  The report also points out that there have been no technological breakthroughs for crops such as sorghum, millet, and cassava, the staple crops grown on marginal lands by poor people and mostly consumed by them.The paper discusses the case of China, where a rural development strategy focusing on the non-farm sector brought about a significant change in the structure of the economy. In addition to boosting the rural economy, this strategy increased farmers’ incomes and contributed to poverty reduction. The report also deals with the experiences of India in another non-farm arena, rural public works as an employment generation scheme for the rural poor. The report discusses some examples from IFAD’s experience to demonstrate the potential of local governance and decentralisation in rural poverty reduction.Recommendations:more vigorous research in technologies that revive the productivity growth of staples in the marginal uplands and drylandsthe poor in these less favoured areas need to be better informed in their judgements of the new technical change in seeds, fertilizers and land-water management aspects, through more regular open interaction with pro-poor scientists in the relevant topic areas. Such interaction should be in an open science environment subject to public, democratic controlas and when appropriate, there should be alternative and sustainable approaches based on a possible blending of indigenous farmers’ knowledge and modern practices. Well-informed public debate would also verify the claims of biotechnology to address the specific problems of poor farmers and marginal areasthe potential of sustainable or regenerative agriculture, as a unique way to boost returns from complex and diverse agricultural systems, is also to be exploreddecentralising resources to the poor and develop them as common properties of the poor, increasing the incomes of the poorcoalitions of the poor to ensure that the transfers accrue to them ;;;International Fund for Agricultural Development ;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"farmers;assessment;land tenure;poverty;land reform;agriculture";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IND;030;034;009;CHN";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12889;http://www.ifad.org/poverty/region/pi/PI_part1.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifad.org%2Fpoverty%2Fregion%2Fpi%2FPI_part1.pdf;;;;"Rural Economy;Farmers;Land tenure;Agriculture and food;poverty;Poverty;land reform;agriculture;Participation"
eldis:A17315;Comprehensive environmental projects: linking adaptation to climate change, sustainable land use, biodiversity conservation and water management;;This report presents an analysis of the synergies between environmental policies and the development of comprehensive environmental projects. More specifically, the report aims to comprehend how climate change, sustainable land use, biodiversity conservation, and water management considerations can be linked in order to help local communities and organisations, to develop and strengthen comprehensive environmental projects.The report discusses the possibilities of linking local projects and needs with international environmental conventions in order to improve the design of strategies by NGO's and community based organisations (CBOs).Section two of the report presents an analysis of the Rio Conventions, in order to identify the linkages and overlaps between different instruments. The section also looks at funding availability and the role of different actors during international negotiations.Section three presents the results of a consultation process held with a total of 32 organisations on the additional benefits that their projects can generate to diminish or even solve environmental stresses. In order to link the discussions at international level with in-field realities, the section presents several obstacles that NGO's and CBO's have to confront when implementing their projects or strategies. Consequently, section four is devoted to the solutions or tools accessible to NGO's and CBO's in order to overcome these obstacles.Special attention is devoted throughout the report to considerations regarding adaptation to climate change. In-field projects, the report notes, are already being exposed to changes in climatic patterns, and some NGO's or CBO's are either analysing how to adapt to the present circumstances, or considering if their projects can improve resilience to climate change. The intention of the report, is to present some initial steps towards a broader discussion on how in-field experiences can help guide discussions at international level, in order to obtain better guidelines and funding mechanisms to implement adaptation projects. ;A.

eldis:A42106;Who’s oil? Sudan’s oil industry;;Oil is a principal factor in Sudanese politics. However, rather than contributing to an environment of peace and equitable development, it remains a source of strife and division.This dossier provides an overview of Sudan’s oil industry and serves as a background document about the country’s contentious oil issues. The tables with data in the first two chapters help the reader to get a picture of Sudan’s oil industry. The third chapter has a more analytical content and gives a better understanding of the consequences of oil extraction on the lives of the Sudanese citizens.The signing of Sudan’s Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/ Army (SPLM/A) in 2005, ended war in the South, but three years after signing, the CPA is in great danger. Its provisions have never been fully implemented. All points of contention on the implementation of the agreement relate to oil, including the North-South border demarcation, withdrawal of troops from the oil fields, oil revenue sharing and transparency, and the industry’s dramatic social and environmental record, which are undermining popular support for the peace agreement. The large economic growth over the last few years has made a small Northern elite very rich, but most Sudanese people have seen nothing of it.The political and security situation in the oil areas has remained tense as a result of the unsatisfactory implementation of CPA. Ordinary people see scarcely any peace or oil dividend. The former heavy-handed security arrangements are no longer in effect.The SPLM/A is gradually strengthening its hold over the oil regions, while exploration and development operations are extending southwards from the existing fields into areas without presence from the national army, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF). The document concludes that although at present there is no direct threat for clashes between the different forces, the oil fields remain a high risk area. Also, continued fighting in Darfur can threaten operations of oil companies in the Darfur-South Kordofan border area and spill over to the South. ;;;European Coalition on Oil in Sudan ;eldis;01/01/2008;en;extractive industries;;;"SDN;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A42106;http://www.ecosonline.org/back/pdf_reports/2008/dossier%20final%20groot%20web.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecosonline.org%2Fback%2Fpdf_reports%2F2008%2Fdossier%2520final%2520groot%2520web.pdf;;;;"Conflict and security;Peacebuilding;Sudan;Document Quick Add;environmental impact;Darfur;destruction and displacement;natural resources as driver of conflict;conflict resolution and reconciliation;oil industry;Drivers of conflict"
eldis:A43607;Land grab or development opportunity? Agricultural investment and international land deals in Africa;;"Over 2008 large-scale acquisitions of farmland in Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Southeast Asia have increased. This report discusses key trends and drivers in land acquisitions, the contractual arrangements underpinning them and the way these are negotiated. It also analyses the early impacts on land access for rural people in recipient countries with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. The paper discusses the factors that underpin land acquisitions, which include: food security concerns due to limited available water and arable land; bottlenecks in storage and distribution; and the expansion of biofuel production. For people in recipient countries, land aquisition creates both risks and opportunities. Increased investment may bring macro-level benefits and may create opportunities for economic development and livelihood improvement in rural areas. However, large-scale land acquisitions may result in local people losing access to the resources on which they depend for their food security.The authors argue that many countries do not have legal mechanisms in place to protect local rights and take account of local interests, livelihoods and welfare. Lack of transparency is characteristic in many host countries as well as vaguely defined productive use of land, legislative gaps, and compensation limited to loss of improvements like crops and trees. These all undermine the position of local people.It is noted that recommendations for policy and practice can only be tentative at this stage as land deals take many different forms and proceed in a wide diversity of contexts. This diversity means that recommendations need to be tailored to their contexts; therefore, the authors give recommendations to different stakeholders.To investors:

    adopt innovative business models that promote local participation in economic activities
    careful assessment of local contexts is critical, clear principles for engagement at the local level are required
    clarity is needed about the costs and benefits of the business transaction from the start. 

To recipient governments: 

    increase attention to agricultural productivity. There needs to be an assessment of how gains are achieved and how benefits are shared
    structure land contracts so as to maximise the investment’s contribution to sustainable development
    present clear information on procedures to investors
    provide legal support to people affected by investment projectsto help them get a better deal from incoming investment 

To international development agencies:

    engage with investor and recipient governments, private sector and civil society to ensure that land deals maximise the investment’s contribution to sustainable development
    help address the lack of clear and easily accessible information on land acquisitions and agricultural investments
    provide expert advice, capacity building and other support for governments, private sector and civil society, with regards to the negotiation of contracts.

eldis:A43603;“Land grabbing” by foreign investors in developing countries. Risks and opportunities;;"One of the effects of the food price crisis on the world food system is the increasing acquisition of farmland in developing countries by other countries seeking to ensure their food supplies.This brief analyses the pros and cons of land acquisitions in developing countries by capital rich economies. It argues that acquisitions have the potential to inject much needed investment into agriculture and rural areas in poor developing countries resulting into creation of farm and off-farm jobs and development of rural infrastructure. Other possible positive spillovers include resources for new agricultural technologies and practices as well as future global price stability and increased production of food crops. On the other hand, this could also impact negatively on poor local people, who risk losing access to and control over land on which they depend. The authors note that even though some of the land-lease agreements make provisions for investments in rural development, these deals may not be made on equal terms. The bargaining power in negotiating these agreements is on the side of the foreign firm, especially when its aspirations are supported by the host state or local elites. The brief recommends that a code of conduct for host governments and foreign investors needs to be established to control threats in land acquisition. The key elements of a code of conduct for foreign land acquisition presented as:

    transparency in negotiations: existing local landholders must be informed and involved in negotiations over land deals 
    respect for existing land rights, including customary and common property rights 
    sharing of benefits: the local community should benefit, not lose, from foreign investments in agriculture
    careful environmental impact assessment and monitoring: these should required to ensure sound and sustainable agricultural production practices
    adherence to national trade policies: when national food security is at risk domestic supplies should have priority. 

Recommendations noted include:

    institutional arrangements should be modeled after the international business laws adopted over the past 10 years to prevent corrupt practices in the context of foreign direct investment 
    a code of conduct for foreign land acquisition requires international arrangements and laws that apply everywhere 
    target countries should improve investment climates through rule of law and contract security
    strong collective action institutions should be set up to ensure smallholders effectively voice their concerns and negotiate on favorable terms with the other powerful actors 
    contract farming and out-grower schemes that involve existing farmers and land users should be used to enable smallholders to benefit from foreign investment while giving the private sector room to invest.

eldis:A44197;Trading conflict for development: utilising the trade in minerals from eastern DR Congo for development;;"This paper relays that the renewed outbreak of violence in North Kivu in the second half of 2008 saw the long running insecurity in Eastern DR Congo become the top global news story for two weeks as another humanitarian crisis unfolded before the world. The intense media scrutiny resulted in a plethora of stakeholders working, as the authors assert, to portray the conflict in ways that best fitted their own agendas; in particular, the region’s mineral wealth was implicated as contributing in the violence. However, this report suggests that trade militarisation is a symptom of conflict rather than its cause, and therefore asks policy makers to address the real causes of insecurity in Eastern DR Congo. These are identified as the ubiquitous governance weaknesses, and the inability of the Congolese state to maintain the monopoly of violence. The report suggests that, instead of trying to ‘stop’ or ‘interrupt’ the minerals trade, formalising a large percentage of it would contribute to achieving long-term security. This is because, as the research states, that stopping or interrupting approaches are not only impossible to successfully implement in the context of Eastern DR Congo; they also have severe retarding effects on regional development. The paper profers different approaches to the intransigent DRC conflict. These include: 

    recognise and prioritise the principal impediments to trade reform and place them at the centre of reform initiatives 
    improve governance structures
    encourage formalisation through transparency in tax and customs declarations and by addressing operational difficulties of export regimes 
    frame reforms in the context of regional development 
    build a functioning national army in the DR Congo.

eldis:A33450;Conflicts between farmers and herders in north-western Mali;;"This report provides insight into the local management of conflict over natural resources between herders and farmers in north-western Mali. The study finds that social, economic and environmental change within the region has led to growing pressure on natural resources and a marked deterioration in relations between farmers and herders. The paper warns that because this conflict is based on ethnicity, there is potential for serious escalation. The paper discusses the following: 

    environmental and livelihood characteristics in north-western Mali 
    rules governing access to and use of natural resources 
    conflicts within and between communities 
    conflict management 

The paper recommends a number of measure that can be taken to improve natural resource management and conflict management in the area: 

    clearly defined areas should be designated for pastoral and agricultural use, taking account of inter-and intra-annual variations in the areas where natural resources are found 
    compliance with all the rules should be monitored, and fields and livestock watched over during the rainy season, with the backing of committees representing all sedentary groups 
    local conflict resolution mechanisms should be reinforced by involving all the protagonists in the damage assessment and subsequent negotiations while also involving mediators who are respected by all parties 
    identifying and promoting other forms of income could contribute to better management of the production imbalances characteristic of the region, and reduce competition between livestock owners over access to grazing and water.

eldis:A17268;Agrarian change, gender and land rights: a Brazilian case study;;This paper examines the marginalization of women's land rights by governmental institutions and rural women's movements in Brazil. The authors point out that the issue of land rights in Brazil has been largely overlooked, and attempt to consider previously overlooked aspects of family farming.The authors find:that the empowerment of women within agrarian reform is occurring in an unpremeditated way and parallel to demands raised by the leadership of rural movementsthat the influence of the active role played by women in the encampments of occupied land may be diluted in the return to traditional gender relations as settlements are established, or may even generate frustrations that cannot be ventedother opportunities may be emerging for settled women as they become increasingly involved in a variety of productive activities, whether in women's associations, participating in and even presiding over co-operatives, or working outside the settlementThe authors conclude that these new options may well present ways for empowerment.This paper is divided up into two main sections:the first section presents broader transformations of the Brazilian rural economy, principally over the last two decades, and the major changes that have occurred in the position of rural women as a result of agricultural modernizationthe next section then describes the challenges posed by women's land rights from the perspectives of several different groupsThese sections are based on qualitative analysis of documents and pamphlets both from the government and the various movements, and on field research carried out between July and September 2000. ;J.

eldis:A73476;Looking back, looking ahead : land, agriculture and society in East Africa : a festschrift for Kjell Havnevik;;"Professor Kjell Havnevik is retiring from the Nordic Africa Institute (NAI) in 2015. For four decades, he has carried out research, taught and supervised students as well as participated in policy debates on different aspects of agriculture, the environment and African and international development policies. His output has been voluminous and is internationally recognised. His academic record includes research and teaching positions at universities and research institutes in Tanzania, Norway and Sweden as well as shorter assignments in several other countries. Yet his intellectual home has over the last three decades been at the Nordic Africa Institute in Uppsala.
NAI has therefore taken this opportunity to publish a book mainly centred on development issues in Tanzania in the context of rural development in Africa – a theme that Kjell has pursued throughout his career. The book brings together research issues with which Kjell himself has been actively involved.
It is NAI's hope that this will be more than a traditional Festschrift, inasmuch as it includes reflections on the academic and wider intellectual debate on development issues from the 1970s until today.

eldis:A27359;Malawi: Services and policies needed to support sustainable smallholder agriculture;;"Malawi’ s smallholder agriculture is facing a crisis, particularly in the more populated south. There is an insidious combination of land shortage, continuous cultivation of maize, declining soil fertility, low yields, deforestation, poverty and high population growth rate. Smallholder farmers are doing what they can to maintain household livelihoods under these difficult circumstances, however many of their actions, which are necessary for short term survival, such as the cultivation of hillsides, are not sustainable in the long term. Smallholder farmers have shown themselves keen to transform their farming towards a sustainable system; however, to do this on the necessary scale they will need a combination of:resource conserving technologies:  including: incorporating more legumes into the rotation, particularly Magoye soya bean;  interplanting with trees such as Faidherbia albida; aligning ridges with A frames and planting Vetiver hedges; relay planting with N fixing plants (such as Tephrosia);  planting multipurpose trees in hedgerows, around homesteads etc;  improved two year fallows; diversification, especially growing some burley tobacco local institutional development: effective community instititions, the managed transfer of responsibility for natural resource management from Government to community, with support for long-term strategies more enabling environment: reducing the fertilizer:maize price ratio;  better research/extension; revised land tenure regulations; cash for work; off-farm employment; relocationThe full text of the six country reports is also available online  ";"M.

eldis:A31465;Land in Africa: market asset or secure livelihood?;;"This document summarises the proceedings from a conference organised by International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) , Natural Resource insitute (NRI) and the Royal African Society in November 2004.The conference brought together a wide range of interest groups including, African policy makers, academics and civil society representatives, as well as representatives of the private sector and international agencies, to debate the way ahead for land rights and land reforms in Africa.
The event addressed two key dimensions of land and property rigths in Africa today and their implications for future stability, prosperity and reduction:

    the links between propery rights, investment and the generation of econoimc opportunities in the context of global integration
    how best to secure access to land for farmers and the urban poor as the basis for imporved livelihoods and food security.

Emphasis was placed on sharing experience from a range of African countries and a series of thematic discussions focussed on:

    formalising and securing land rights: diverse approaches from Africa
    gender, land rights and inheritance
    urban and peri-urban land development and land use conflict
    securing collective rights to land and natural resources.

In conclusion to the conference, the African Union recognised that for African governments to take the lead in land policy and tenure they need to:

    give political support and long term commitement
    break the barriers that current donor mechanisms present
    put land issues into the wider economic development agenda
    use the technical support that donors can provide
    make training and capacity building essential skills to be learnt through learning networks and platforms
    build and share models of innovation that are rooted in locally developed innovation
    engage in policy dialogue to achieve radical new solutions to land issues in southern Africa.

eldis:A21805;Land tenure reform and gender equality;;This brief explores the reform of land tenure institutions which re-emerged in the 1990s, and asks if these reforms are any more gender sensitive than those of the past?The paper highlights that a focus of the recent reforms has been on land titling, designed to promote security of tenure and stimulate land markets. The reforms have often been driven by domestic and external neoliberal coalitions, with funding from global and regional organisations which have argued that private property rights are essential for a dynamic agricultural sector. However, democratic transitions, though often fragile, have opened up new possibilities for agrarian reform, placing inequalities in land distribution back on national agendas. The involvement of social movements, including women’s movements, and their domestic and international allies has been the other hallmark of recent policy debates on land.The research finds that the new generation of land tenure reforms is not necessarily more gender equitable than earlier efforts, even though women’s ability to gain independent access to land is increasingly on the statutes. In particular, the findings show that:in recent years, multilateral agencies have supported gender equality goals. At the same time, they have been influential in advising governments on how to pursue a market-driven land reform programme. These two goals are in tension, especially in terms of their impacts on low-income womenpolicy makers in national and international agencies need to be vigilant about the kinds of informal community-based institutions that are being legitimised and strengthened as appropriate decision-making forums for dealing with land. A key area for policy attention is how to strengthen and democratise these institutions to deliver social and gender justicethere has been concern about the ways in which “traditionalist” discourses and “customary” practices are frequently used to deprive women of equal rights. However, criticism of customary tenure should not lead to the oversimplified conclusion that land markets are a gender- neutral terrainthere is recognition about the limitations in law as a vehicle for social change, acknowledging that there may be enormous resistance to equitable practices.[adapted from author] ;S.

eldis:A33515;Transparency and accountability in Africa’s extractive industries: the role of legislature;;"This report identifies the challenges that African legislators face in overseeing their countries’ oil and mining industries, as well as best practices in use around the world and recommendations for future engagement. The report finds that international organisations, local advocacy groups, and multinational corporations have played a key role in increasing public access to information and awareness in government oversight. Also, a growing number of African legislatures are more active in the management and oversight of the extractive sector. However, political and institutional constraints are the principal stumbling blocks to improved management and oversight of the extractive industries. Key recommendations include: 

    legislative bodies and Individual members should take advantage of international interest and support for increased transparency and accountability to develop more specialised knowledge and become more engaged in management and oversight issues 
    international advocacy groups and local civic activists and organisations should seek opportunities to work with legislative bodies, and promote legislative participation in extractive industry initiatives 
    members of the international community and the private sector should include legislative bodies and individual legislators in capacity building programs to improve extractive industry management and oversight

eldis:A42966;The effects of biofuels policies on global commodity trade flows;;Trade in ethanol is increasing, and raises the need for the classification of various biofuels within frameworks such as the WTO. With that being said, this paper wonders how do biofuels policies and programs fit within the WTO’s stated goals of liberalisation. In addition, it examines the effects of the rapid biofuels expansion on the prices of grains, and the effects triggered in the livestock industries. The paper indicates that the biofuels industry affects and is affected by government policies in countries around the globe. In fact, governments' policies are designed to promote the domestic consumption, and perhaps in some cases, the eventual export of biofuels. However, the paper notes that the motivations behind government promotion of biofuels are complex, involving issues ranging from the environment and climate change to agriculture and farm income.The paper figures that trade in biofuels is small relative to world-wide production. Nonetheless, given ambitious consumption mandates in many developed countries as well as increasing energy consumption, this will not likely remain the case in the long-run. Furthermore, the paper underlines that ethanol is currently marketed as an agricultural product, though not specifically for fuel use. Therefore, the removal of trade barriers, particularly in the developed countries, would ease pressure on the traditional feedstocks, and also lower world ethanol prices. In addition, it would allow countries with a comparative advantage to capitalise on the opportunity to produce low-cost biofuel. Yet, the paper finds that whether the removal of these trade barriers on biofuels would affect their efficacy as a political tool remains to be seen. ;"B. Fridfinnson

eldis:A75230;CARP institutional assessment in a post-2008 transition scenario: toward a new rural development architecture;;"The main objective of the paper is to explore possible institutional arrangements among the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), Philippines, implementing agencies in a post-2008 transition scenario for CARP. There were three reasons cited for the implementation of the agrarian reform program, namely: (i) to increase productivity, (ii) to reduce inequality particularly in the countryside, and (iii) to address one of the main causes of the persistent Communist insurgency in the country.

After reviewing previous studies on new institutional arrangements, the paper recommends the following based on two scenarios. For scenario 1: (extension of CARP for another 7 to 10 years), the following are proffered: a) shifting manpower and resources toward units in DAR that are engaged in LAD and AJD; b) identification and publication of privately agricultural lands that will be covered by the LAD component; c) retooling of DAR personnel to assist in establishing agricultural enterprises out of a partnership between ARBs and agribusiness firms; d) providing capacity-building training for LGUs in preparation for the closure of the program; and e) exerting efforts to collect amortization payments from the ARBs.

For Scenario 2 (closure of CARP is envisioned in the next 3 to 5 years), the following are recommended: a) an attractive retirement package should be given to DAR personnel; b) creation of a Land Tenure Administration; c) conversion of PARC into a Joint Commission on Rural Development (JCRD); d) renaming of the Department of Agriculture (DA) to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD); e) capacitating LGUs to provide support services to the ARBs; f) passage of a “Progressive Agricultural Land Tax” for private agricultural lands and “Progressive Rents” for public lands; and g) deregulation of land tenure contracts and land markets.

eldis:A44039;Caste and land productivity in rural Nepal;;This paper looks for the possible explanations for the land productivity differential between high caste and low caste farm households in Nepal. The paper indicates that caste position still plays a vital role in rural areas of Nepal.The paper finds that: land productivity is higher among low caste households. However, in case of owner-operated plots, the land productivity differential between low caste and high caste is found to be insignificant after controlling for land quality and household characteristics. This difference remains highly significant in case of rented in plots. In case of all plots, the land productivity difference between high caste and low caste remains significant. Persistence of productivity differential even after land-rental market participation is perceived by the paper as an indication of significant transaction costs in the land-rental market.  Improvement of land-rental market is an appropriate policy for poverty reduction and efficiency. Furthermore, land-rental market helps reduce productivity differential by increasing access of the poor households to land. Accordingly, one way of improving the land-rental market is to design the policy in such a way that landlords do not hesitate to rent out land with a formal contract due to fear of losing full or partial ownership of land. The paper suggests that reducing caste-based inequality may improve the overall productivity in agriculture. There is a need, both at central and local level, to make policies to ensure social inclusion and bringing low caste in the mainstream of development by improving their access to economic resources. ;"J.

eldis:A23664;"More than simply ""socially embedded"": recognising the distinctiveness of African land rights";;"Land tenure reform remains a key policy issue in Africa, given the large proportion of people relying on land and natural resources for their livelihoods. This paper addresses the exclusionary nature of many processes around land, which can lead to social divisions. The increasing vulnerability of a poor majority must be the central focus of land policies, and democratisation of decision-making around land rights should be integral to these policies.The authors reveal that it is not enough to simply acknowledge the socially, politically and historically embedded character of land rights, or the unequal outcomes of contemporary forms of ""enclosure"". Specifically, they find that:occupation and use rights must be made socially legitimate as they are currently held and practised – regardless of whether or not they are ""customary""law and policy needs to respond to the key features of these property regimes. If they do not, there is a risk of distorting them in attempts to codify and register rightslegal frameworks should attribute land rights to those who occupy and use land, and not in groups or institutions. These frameworks should recognise that rights are often shared and socially relative, and therefore also be flexiblethe State must play a key role in overseeing local governance. This is needed to ensure democratic principles are applied and that there is accountability to the majority of rights-holders. ";"B. Cousins

eldis:A62853;Climate-friendly agriculture and the clean development mechanism: an assessment of future prospects for agriculture and land use change in Latin America;;Market solutions based on the trade of carbon offset credits remain a dominant feature in international climate change negotiations. This paper undertakes a preliminary assessment of potential of climate change mitigation projects by evaluating Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects related to agriculture and land use change in Latin America. Results suggest that potential benefits of carbon markets in the agriculture and forestry sectors are often overstated, with failures in the areas of additionality, project accountability and sustainable development. The data indicates that industrial agriculture, already a major driver of climate change, will benefit more from carbon markets than smallholder agriculture, raising concerns related to climate justice and sustainable development. The paper was presented at the International Conference on Global Land Grabbing II held at Cornell University, United States, in October 2012. ;H.

eldis:A101578;South African banks footprint in SADC mining projects: environmental, social and governance principles;;Environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  concerns  are  an  increasingly  important  factor worldwide for banks when they invest in large projects. In the Southern African region with its rich mineral deposits, this trend has added importance. Mining companies extract minerals from the ground, and their activities routinely give rise to public concerns about the pollution of water sources, adequate land for agriculture, and fair community participation in mining projects. South African law accepts that the directors of corporations such as banks have fiduciary obligations to act in the best interests of shareholders.Given the importance of mining activity to economies in Southern Africa an important question aligned to this fiduciary duty is this: Are banks when conducting business obliged to act in the best interests of stakeholders affected by the activities of the mining companies they fund? The trite response is that banks have recognised their obligations to communities through their commitment to SRI (socially responsible investment) practices and internal ESG processes that ensure that their funding decisions result in no harm to communities.This paper sets out to critically consider the effectiveness of ESG principles implemented by South Africa’s banks when they fund mining projects in the SADC region. There are internal differences  in  ESG  principles  between  banks,  and  a  variety  of  funding  methods  to  which  the principles  are  applied. The study evaluates the ESG frameworks used by each bank and, given the significant market share, aggregates this information to present a picture of the effectiveness of  these  frameworks. The approach taken is a critical one, meaning that what is presented in bank annual reports and sustainability reports is not merely accepted, but (to the extent possible) internal ESG risk frameworks are interrogated for adequacy of application by banks when funding mining  projects. The effectiveness of the implementation of internal ESG  procedures  by banks is then measured against available evidence. This evidence includes the effects of mine project  funding  decisions  of  banks  on  ESG  categories  as  ascertained  from  public  information.  After consideration of the evidence, observations and conclusions are provided on the analysis. In the closing section, recommendations are provided on areas for possible focus to improve the effectiveness of ESG principles used by banks in the SADC region. ;M.

eldis:A25379;Improving water resource management in Bangladesh;;The management of water resources has become a critical need in Bangladesh because of growing demand for water and increasing conflict over its alternative uses.As populations expand and make various uses of water, its growing scarcity becomes a serious issue in developing countries such as Bangladesh. Water can no longer be considered a totally free resource, and plans must be developed for its efficient use through better management and rules that preserve everybody's access to it and interest in its development. Because it is a common resource, its development and management should involve all beneficiaries.The government's role in this process is to establish the ground rules for water use and conservation through a policy and legal framework and a monitoring system that ensure its continued safety of supply to --- and responsible use of water by --- every sector and user in the economy. National water policy must set the ground rules for allocation to different users, water rights, pricing, and environmental safety.Bangladesh's water strategy should start with a national water policy that spells out key objectives such as priority of use by critical economic sectors, approaches to water pricing and cost recovery for development, and shared public and private sector water management. An apex public planning organization is needed to perform overall planning for water resources and to advise the National Water Counsel on policy and legislation. Also needed are agencies to implement public water plans for the development of infrastructure, the monitoring of water regimes, and the enforcement of regulations.This paper --- a product of the Agricultural and Natural Resources Division, South Asia, Country Department I --- is part of a larger effort in the department to analyze the major issues in managing land and water resources and developing a strategy to improve the management of these vital resources of the economy.

eldis:A13869;The ‘new’ communities: land tenure reform and the advent of new institutions in Zambézia Province, Mozambique;;Recently, new community-level institutions have emerged in Zambézia province, Mozambique, through land rights registration. Numerous rural groups have delimited their acquired land rights and established community-level management systems. This paper assesses the rise of these ‘new’ institutions and whether they have replicated, replaced, or been added on to the existing pattern of state and nonstate institutions and processes.The new communities have registered large swathes of land, but have had had a limited impact on development processes. They are not yet recognised by the state as legitimate actors in planning land and resource use, adjudicating disputes, or allocating rights. Existing traditional authorities and/or local government have largely maintained their roles and legitimacy, even in areas with new institutions.The authors conclude that new community groups face a dual challenge: from a state reluctant to deal with implications of devolution, and from their own constituents familiar with and respectful of traditional mechanisms.

eldis:A70498;Drivers of agricultural diversification in India, Haryana and the Greenbelt farms of India ;;"Traditionally, agricultural diversification is referred to a subsistence kind of farming wherein farmers were cultivating varieties of crops on a piece of land and undertaking several enterprises on their farm portfolio. Household food and income security were the basic objectives of agricultural diversification. In recent decades, agricultural diversification is increasingly being considered as a panacea for many ills in the agricultural development of the India.

Diversification at the farm level is supposed to increase the farm income; the utility of diversification as risk management practices however, remains. At the country level, diversification is supposed to increase the extent of self-sufficiency for the country. At the regional level, diversification is being promoted to mitigate negative externalities associated with monocropping

This study discusses factors responsible for agricultural diversification at different levels: country (India), state (Haryana) and farms of Kurukshetra district in Haryana. The study regressed alternate measures of diversification namely, the Simpson index and concentration of non-food crops, on several possible factors such as income, land distribution, irrigation intensity, institutional credit, road density, urbanization and market penetration.

The paper concludes by stating that the regression analysis suggests that increased road density, urbanization encourages commercialization of agriculture and with commercialization, farms in a region are increasingly specialized under certain crops and crop-groups as per the resource, infrastructure and institutions of the region.

eldis:A28339;Land tenure reform and the balance of power in eastern and southern Africa;;"This paper examines the current wave of land tenure reform in eastern and southern Africa. It discusses how far tenure reform reflects a shift in powers over property from centre to periphery. A central question is whether tenure reform is designed to deliver to rural smallholders greater security of tenure and greater control over the regulation and transfer of these rights.Policy conclusions include:

    whilst diverse in initial objective, and uneven in delivery, tenure reforms address a remarkably common set of concerns. Most embody significant shifts in the balance of power in state–people property relations 
    overall, tenure reform incorporates new recognition of local level land rights and significant transfer of powers over their disposition nearer to the ordinary landholder 
    some authority over land is being concentrated more at the centre, illustrating the essentially political nature of property relations and the reluctance of central governments to release powers. 
    however, intentionally or otherwise, governments are delivering to landholders new powers and rights in land which may enhance democratisation in this and related spheres 
    the manner in which customary, unregistered rights in land are being regarded in new tenure law represents the most crucial area of change and should yield an African character to property relations in the 21st century.

eldis:A29655;Redistributive land reform in Southern Africa;;Redistributive land reform in southern Africa is reviewed against the background of the recent land crisis in the region. The dilemmas created for governments and donors are described, as are attempts to grapple with them. Answers are sought to four questions: What has been the experience with land redistribution in the region over the last decade or so? What has been the impact on people's livelihoods? How are redistribution programmes expected to develop in future? What might be the role of donors in the process?Policy conclusionsin the design of policy instruments for land redistribution (e.g. form of market intervention, conditions of grant provision) it is important to recognise that redressing past injustices and promoting rural development are different policy objectives. Furthermore, it is important to differentiate between policy instruments intended to diversify ownership in the agricultural sector towards black commercial farmers and instruments to provide new opportunities for the rural poormarket-assisted land reform and expropriation by due legal process have been slow, but principally because of inadequate administrative and technical capacity available to governmentsthe impact of land redistribution on intended beneficiaries has generally been positive although the numbers benefiting remain smallunequal racial ownership of land has the potential for creating further agrarian (and wider economic) crises in the region unless addressed by accelerated progress in land redistributiondemands upon donors are likely to increase: the main purpose of support should be to enhance administrative and technical capacity[Author] ;"M.

eldis:A27614;Land degradation and grazing in the Kalahari: new analysis and alternative perspectives;;Results from this study show that the over-used but under-researched association between grazing and land degradation in the Kalahari has been oversimplified. In typical Kalahari conditions, the ecological changes that have been brought about by grazing cannot be linked with more fundamental changes in ecosystem function. Basic soil processes appear relatively unaffected by grazing pressure outside the sacrifice zone, and there is no evidence to suggest that the resilience of the system has been affected through soil degradation. It should, however, be noted that this may not hold true for other semi-arid areas (including other parts of Botswana), where additional agents of soil degradation, such as soil erosion, come into play. ;"A.

eldis:A39870;Water and conflict: making water delivery conflict-sensitive in Uganda;;"Water projects have, arguably, the greatest potential to create conflict in development programmes. Not only is water central to health, sanitation and agrarian livelihoods but it can contribute to other conflict dynamics such as land or grazing rights. Applying conflict-sensitive programming to water projects, therefore, seeks to minimise the potential for fuelling conflict whilst looking to maximise the potential positive impact of the development. This paper details the experience of applying conflict-sensitivity to two water projects in Uganda. It highlights the lessons learnt and seeks to contribute to a broader understanding of how these approaches can be used by development actors. The authors detail a number of key lessons, including: 

    Conflict Sensitive Approaches (CSA) bring different benefits to different stakeholders - local government in the project areas saw it as a useful tool to improve the quality of community participation and ownership of the district-provided water and other services
    CSA can be a tool for deepening beneficiary participation - sufficient ‘space’ needs to be created for a wide variety of community members to air their views and to address their concerns as much as possible. This is vital to avoid the risk of dissatisfied stakeholders sabotaging the scheme
    the timing of undertaking conflict analysis and making sure it feeds into project design, implementation and monitoring is crucial to conflict-sensitising projects 
    adopting a conflict-sensitive approach meant an increase in costs, since the schemes had to be expanded and more funds requested from central government.  However, they are likely to work better due to the quality of the process, thus potentially saving other costs in future. 

The research asserts that experience from this project has shown that applying conflict sensitivity to the water projects generated benefits in terms of: 

    higher quality beneficiary participation
    beneficiaries themselves appreciating the opportunity to discuss what issues divide them and how planned interventions could mitigate or aggravate these
    increased understanding by outsiders (district authorities, private sector actors and CSOs) of beneficiary communities, and the actors and dynamics that influence them
    increased sense of responsibility on the side of the service providers about the impact they could potentially have through the decisions they make and the way they work.

eldis:A33357;Debating shifting cultivation in the Eastern Himalayas: farmers’ innovations as lessons for policy;;"Hundreds of millions of people in Asia are dependent on shifting cultivation, yet the practice has tended to be seen in a negative light and discouraged by policy makers. This document challenges prevailing assumptions, arguing that shifting cultivation – if properly practised – is actually a ‘good practice’ system for productively using hill and mountain land, while ensuring conservation of forest, soil, and water resources. Focusing on Eastern Himalayan farmers, it looks at whether there is a need for new, more effective and more socially acceptable policy options that help to improve shifting cultivation, rather than replace it. The authors discuss common trends in shifting cultivation across the eastern Himalayas, which span six countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, and Nepal. They point out that policy lessons can be learned and exchanged at the regional and global levels by taking a hard look at changes needed to improve shifting cultivation. The key recommendations discussed include: 

    policy makers should re-examine the policies in place, to remove explicit policies and policy instruments that discourage shifting cultivation, and to strengthen the implementation of existing beneficial policies 
    issues of land tenure security, research, and extension should be addressed together with their impact on traditional shifting cultivation practices, market development and commercialisation of niche products of shifting cultivation 
    market development and commercialisation of traditional and new niche products of shifting cultivation systems should be encouraged
    existing credit policies should be make more sensitive and proactive to situations where common property regimes apply.

eldis:A12149;Diamonds, forever or for good?: the economic impact of diamonds in South Africa;;This document considers the economic impact of diamonds in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. It states that the many global campaigns to stop trade in conflict diamonds has tended to ignore the benefits of the legitimate industry for these countries. The author describes a study that attempts to verify the claims regarding the positive aspects of the industry. This, it is argues, is important because concern about possible economic damage to these countries has caused NGOs campaigning against conflict diamonds to be less aggressive where consumers are concerned, than might otherwise have been the case.The paper provides some history of the industry in these three Southern African countries. It looks at the development of the trade in Botswana and the the economic benefits accruing to government there. Although these are significant, they do not seem to be significantly filtering down and reducing poverty. The author also points out that Botswana is not diversifying its income generation sufficiently away from diamonds, which are a finite resource. Similar analyses of the history and economics of the industry in Namibia and South Africa are presented.The author concludes that, with the exception of Botswana, diamonds contribute little to total government revenue in the region, and their contribution to employment in all three countries is small and declining. This means that diamonds cannot be identified very directly either with good development or its absence.However, the report defines some reasons for success and future priorities for improving benefits from the diamond industry:through good governance, management and control of supply, Botswana has managed to retain significant income from diamonds while retaining its political stabilitybenefits to local economies must be improvedthese three countries have benefited from the Kimberley process, developing new regulations, although evidence of conflict diamond trade in South Africa has to be better addressedultimately the responsibility for ending conflict diamond trade lies with the industry and with genuine corporate responsibility ;R.
