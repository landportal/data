eldis:A65575;Pastoralists and wildlife conservation in western China: collaborative management within protected areas on the Tibetan Plateau;;"Background Pastoralists have long inhabited vast areas of western China, including the Tibetan Plateau region. Their traditional land use practices and cultural conservation ethic have helped to protect the natural resource base upon which they depend and the wildlife that co-exist with them in the grassland landscapes. However, in a rapidly changing socio-economic environment, including significant expansion of the protected area system and regional comprehensive development plans, local communities do not always have an evident voice in the conservation and development dialogues that closely affect their lives.

With introduction and development of collaborative management - that is, a partnership between local communities, nature reserve authorities and other stakeholders - a landscape-level approach to conservation is now being modelled in Qinghai Province. Central to effective co-management are bi-directional relationships. There are also a wealth of direct and indirect services that may be provided by pastoralists under co-management, and in the compensation and payment options available to them in return for their critical services.

As this paper concludes, the contributions of pastoralists to wildlife conservation efforts are significant, but up to now insufficiently recognised. New insights regarding the relationship between pastoralists and wildlife conservation - including the potential role of community ecotourism, the development of local herders' cooperatives and of trust funds, and the need for greater clarity in local regulatory frameworks - are provided herein, with presentation of specific experiences and lessons learned from a project piloted in the headwaters of the Yangtze River over the past decade. A fuller, richer model of co-management is recommended.

eldis:A70571;Environmental livelihood security in Southeast Asia and Oceania: a water-energy-food-livelihoods nexus approach for spatially assessing change;;"This document addresses the need for explicit inclusion of livelihoods within the environment nexus (water-energy-food security). The authors present a conceptualisation of ‘environmental livelihood security’, which combines the nexus perspective with sustainable livelihoods. The geographical focus of this paper is Southeast Asia and Oceania, which the authors highlight is a region currently wrought by the impacts of a changing climate. Climate change is the primary external forcing mechanism on the environmental livelihood security of communities in Southeast Asia and Oceania which, therefore, forms the applied crux of this paper. The paper provides a primer for using geospatial information to develop a spatial framework to enable geographical assessment of environmental livelihood security across the region. It concludes by linking the value of this research to ongoing sustainable development discussions, and for influencing policy agendas.

eldis:A70574;Planting the foundations of a post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting framework;;"This paper presents possible elements of a long-term international vision for land sector reporting and accounting. The vision is of a multi-dimensional land sector reporting and accounting framework that is applicable to all countries and increases in comprehensiveness over time. The overarching objective of the framework is to build trust between Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by tracking progress in implementation of mitigation contributions in the land sector. The paper argues that two of the most important dimensions could be the coverage of accounting for key sources and sinks and the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting. It outlines possible short-term steps for COP 20, COP 21 and 2016-2020 that could put Parties on a pathway towards realising the long-term vision.

eldis:A39518;Financing sustainable forest management;;"Despite the adoption of many international agreements over the last decades, degradation of forests and deforestation has continued. Since this is largely due to the market's failure to account for forests' multifunctionality, this issue argues that a new, holistic approach is necessary to ensure sustainable forest management (SFM) is adequately supported and financed. Against this background, 35 articles explore the role of:

    multilateral conventions, agreements and organisations (such as UNFF, UNCCD, UNFCCC, and ITTO)
    international non-government organisations such as WWF, CIFOR and the Global Forest Coalition
    governance, institutions and financing in making SFM a viable alternative to other forest uses
    capital markets in enhancing forest investment
    payment for ecosystem/environmental services (PES) schemes in bridging the gap between payment and the unrecognised demand for environmental goods
    forests in climate change mitigation and energy generation (as underlined by the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme).

It is argued that forest financing should support three objectives: 

    forest conservation and sustainable use
    maintenance of ecosystem services
    fair and equitable sharing of benefits 

The articles discuss that to stop deforestation and forest degradation it will be important to take a number of actions. Recommendations include:

    keep SFM initiatives coherent despite the recent mushrooming of international mechanisms
    support capacity-building rather than simply generating more money for SFM
    rapidly identify and expand opportunities not only to maintain the remaining forest resources, but to increase forest cover worldwide
    develop holistic financing strategies for forest sector development and underpin them by sectoral policies
    ensure good governance, i.e. the rule of law, transparency, democracy, participation and accountability
    ensure forest-land tenure is secure and well-defined
    prevent unplanned and uncoordinated changes in land use driven by factors outside of the forest sector
    make sure payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are pro-poor and keep transaction costs low.

eldis:A100778;Current challenges of implementing land - use and land - cover change  in climate assessments;;Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) represents one of the key drivers of global environmental change. However, the processes and drivers of anthropogenic land-use activity are still overly simplistically implemented in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) and Earth System Models (ESMs), whose published results are used in major assessments of processes and impacts of global environmental change such as the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the absence of coupled models of climate, land use and biogeochemical cycles to explore land use – climate interactions across spatial scales, information on LULCC is currently provided as exogenous data from the land-use change modules of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to ESMs and DGVMs, while data from dedicated land-use change models (LUCMs) are rarely considered. In this article, we discuss major uncertainties and existing shortcomings of current implementation strategies originating in both LULCC data-provider and LULCC data-user communities.The authors identify, based on literature review and the analysis of empirical and modeled LULCC data, three major challenges related to LULCC representation, which are currently not or insufficiently accounted for: (1) provision of consistent, harmonized LULCC time series spanning from historical reconstructions to future projections while accounting for uncertainties due to different land-use modeling approaches, (2) accounting for sub-grid processes and bi-directional changes (gross changes) across spatial scales and (3) the allocation strategy of LULCC at the grid cell level in ESMs and DGVMs.Based on these three challenges, the paper discusses the reasons that hamper the development of implementation strategies that sufficiently account for uncertainties in the land-use modeling process and conclude that both providers and users of LULCC data products often miss appropriate knowledge of the requirements and constraints of one another’s models, thus leading to large discrepancies between the representation of LULCC data and processes in both communities. The authors propose to focus future research on the joint development and evaluation of enhanced LULCC time series, which account for the diversity of LULCC modeling and increasingly include empirically based information about sub-grid processes and land-use transition trajectories. ;;;Earth System Dynamics;eldis;01/01/2016;en;"climate change;land;assessment";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A100778;http://www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net/esd-2016-39/esd-2016-39.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net%2Fesd-2016-39%2Fesd-2016-39.pdf;CC-BY;Open - CC - Attribution (CCBY);;"Climate change Forestry;land - use harmonization;Land issues;land - climate  interaction;Agriculture and food;Earth System model;Climate change;global vegetation model;land - use  allocation;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;gross transitions"
eldis:A11269;The Kimberley Process: the case for proper monitoring;;This paper describes the outcomes of the Kimberley Process, which aims to create a certification system for rough diamonds, so excluding illicit diamonds, which fuel conflict, from the global diamond trade.The author focuses on the provisions the process has made for monitoring certified diamonds. He provides an overview of the monitoring provisions of the Kimberley Process as agreed at its March 2002 Ottawa meeting. The paper compares these with the monitoring provisions in other international agreements, and rates them against the problems the Kimberley Process aims to resolve, arguing that much stronger measures will be required if the agreement is to be credible and effective.The document contains a proposal for ‘essential elements’ of an effective and credible Kimberley process monitoring system. And it concludes that if such a system is not adopted, the Kimberley Process will create a false sense of security, allowing conflict diamonds to continue entering the system, ultimately placing the entire diamond industry at risk.

eldis:A39514;Land and decentralisation in Senegal;;"Land and decentralisation policies in Senegal have been closely linked since the country became independent in 1960. Although local governments manage public lands and participate in the management of special areas, the actual degree popular participation in land and decentralisation policies occurs strongly depends on the rights granted to local communities and governments and the available human and financial resources. This paper explores these issues and discusses their effect on decentralisation and land management in Senegal.
 
    The authors explore local authorities' representativeness as well as the human and financial resources available to them. They highlight three points: decentralisation policies should be intensified to foster sustainable local government; infrastructure, public services and support for economic activities are needed and; the translation of legislative advances into action has been too slow.
     
        The security of land tenure in rural areas remains insufficient despite the national land law of 1964. This situation - which undermines the necessary modernisation of rural Senegal - is due to several factors: 
        
            political authorities and administrations have been slow in translating legislation into action
            farmers have never accepted the abolition of their customary rights
            neither the State nor local governments have sufficient human or financial resources to apply the law
            rural councils are unable to manage national land in a sustainable manner
            there is a growing number of illegal land sales and rentals 
        
        Attempts to reform land rights have also failed due to the State's refusal to recognise the social nature of land policy and to include stakeholders in the decision making process. The authors recommend that any successful land policy should: 
        
            reverse the fragmentation of family farms
            give local governments the human and financial resources they require to manage land and natural resources sustainably
            address problems associated with urbanisation
            open rural land to economic use by the growing urban population
            balance the ensuing loss of land for the rural population by an inflow of financial capital to rural areas

eldis:A42896;Guide to operating in areas of conflict for the oil & gas industry;;"This is a guide for companies working in the extractive industries, particularly in the oil and gas sectors and provides basic conflict management advice and guidance. Its objective is to save time, to protect resources and reputations, and to enhance the safety of employees and of the communities in which they do business.The guide presents tools for risk assessment and risk management in conflict settings, including:

    conflicts between companies and local communities which are directly related to the presence and operations of the companies themselves 
    wider social and political conflicts in which companies are not directly involved but which are very likely to impact on companies operating in such conflict environments

Part one covers risk assessment - potential risks, community impacts, and reputation and ethical dilemmas companies might encounter when seeking to invest in geographic regions of conflict, and when planning new investments in countries where companies have existing operations. This involves a three-step approach:

    traditional risk assessment – identifies whether and where conflict is likely within a geographic or political area, and if it is ongoing, post conflict, or potential conflict
    conflict analysis - identifies the nature and causes of the conflict
    conflict impact assessment (CIA) - identifies how investments or corporate activities will affect the potential or existing conflict and vice versa

Part two covers risk management - practical guidance on how to manage conflict in ways that do not compromise ethics and reputation, or contravene national laws and international norms and standards. Risk management approaches include:

    ‘do no harm’ in operations - looking at how corporate policies and practices affect the dynamics of a conflict, such as, recruitment, compensation and security
    ‘do something’ – investing in the company’s front-line and backup conflict management capacities; increasing conflict sensitivity of operations and of community outreach projects; and establishing early warning systems for areas prone to violent conflict
    ‘do something ++” - building external conflict management capacity, such as, supporting local and national conflict management resources; providing training; funding study tours to regions where successful conflict management has been achieved; and providing funding and/or technical assistance to national and/or international conflict resolution efforts

The guide suggests that these steps, when undertaken effectively, can assist companies to avoid costly mistakes by alerting them to existing or emerging conflict issues and by informing both investment decisions and successful conflict management strategies.

It also recommends that the International Financial Institutions (IFls) explicitly screen projects for their potential human rights impacts.

Project activities will include: 1. Identifying critical points of erosion and deforestation in Macacos Hill; 2. Promoting Reforestation of Macacos Hill, with the help of residents; 3. Studying and implementing appropriate and low cost technologies for drainage such as: stairway drains; storm water channels to divert the flow from houses; increased drainage area around houses; and roof water retention in barrels.Further, the project will seek to achieve capacity building of the local community regarding: 1. Climate change issues 2. How the community can help with this process, for example, appropriate collection and disposal of wastes, assist in reforestation, and simple actions to increase water drainage and to reduce flows.

eldis:A75809;Realities of the watershed management approach: the Magat watershed experience;;"This paper aims to showcase the experience of the Magat (Philippines) watershed in the implementation of the watershed management approach. Magat watershed was declared as a forest-reservation area through Proclamation No. 573 on June 26, 1969 because of its great importance to human survival and environmental balance in the region. The Magat case demonstrates the important role that ‘champions’ like the local government unit (LGU) could play in managing the country’s watersheds. With the Nueva Viscaya province constituting 97% of the Magat watershed, the provincial government was committed to provide a strong management support system to the watershed. This involved interplay of critical elements, i.e., favorable policy and political environment, enabling social and institutional mechanisms, adequate financial support, and capable and committed actors and players.

The management approach adopted in Nueva Vizcaya treated the watershed as a ‘lifeshed’ where human concerns are connected with land and water resources. It was premised on ‘managing people first’ to relate society’s interests to the use of watershed resources. The provincial government was able to harness various stakeholders’ participation and tap technical and financial support. It provided incentives for people to join in participatory management schemes and to adopt conservation practices. The ‘feeling of control and sense of ownership’ served as ‘lifelines’ for individuals and organizations to sustain the watershed.

eldis:A65073;Urban wastewater and agricultural reuse challenges in India;;Urban wastewater management has become a major challenge in India as infrastructural development and regulations have not kept pace with population growth and urbanisation. This study argues that against the backdrop of water scarcity and climate change, it is important to examine issues related to wastewater reuse more holistically and to investigate the challenges and opportunities for its safe and efficient reuse. The study attempts to analyse the current status of wastewater generation, its uses and livelihood benefits especially in agriculture, based on national data and case studies from Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kanpur and Kolkata. Specifically, the objective is to provide estimates of wastewater generation and treatment, synthesise existing data on agricultural use of wastewater, and assess the related benefits and economic value, as well as the potentially adverse environmental and human health impacts. ;P.

eldis:A10969;Water disputes in South Asia;;The paper examines various water sharing treaties in South Asia, with a comparative evaluation of past and future trends, followed by suggestions for a sustainable future cooperation.It examines:the Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan India and Bangladesh dispute over the Ganges river India and Nepal sharing the Mahakali river watersIt makes the following observations and recommendationsOne common factor in all three water sharing cases discussed above is the dominant attitude displayed by India, by virtue of its sheer size, with a view to controlling regional water resources it shares with othersIn the case of the Mahakali Treaty, India, despite being the lower riparian country, is strong enough to threaten Nepal and in altering the terms in its favourWater-sharing agreements have been highly politicised at domestic levels in Pakistan, Bangladesh and      NepalWars over water between upstream and down-stream neighbours are likely only if a downstream riparian threatens to go to war against an upstream riparian owing to various factors. This sounds a remote possibility in the case of downstream country like Bangladesh, given its lower military capability vis-a-vis IndiaIndia has already taken several initiatives in violation of the Ganges Water Treaty and may violate the  Treaty in future, in the absence of any guaranteeChanging demographic, technological, economic and environmental factors underscore the need for an  cooperation beyond the three co-operation treaties that already exist in the region rather than conflict, not only at bilateral levels but more so at the regional levelManagement of shared river systems should grow beyond the sphere of national sovereignty and bilateral co-operation and must be addressed at the regional level to achieve the best possible use of available waterPolitical leaders in South Asian countries have to be convinced of the potential benefits accruing from such cooperation.

eldis:A101589;Civil society’s role in shaping Zimbabwe’s diamond governance;;Zimbabwe confirmed that alluvial diamonds had been discovered in the Marange area in Mutare District in 2006. However, as in many otherAfrican countries, the promise diamond mining holds for economic growth has been eroded by a lack of transparency and accountability. The country’s diamond sector has been bedevilled by smuggling, opaque licensing, human rights abuses, self-enrichment by executives and public officials, and extremely limited accrual of diamond revenues to the fiscus, among others. Civil society monitoring and lobbying at local, national and international levels has played a critical role in improving the governance of Zimbabwe’s diamond sector. This briefing highlights the actions civil society has taken to promote transparency and accountability in Zimbabwe’s diamond sector. It concludes that civil society has contributed significantly towards better diamond sector governance in Zimbabwe in the last 10 years. It has also helped to broaden the view of what constitute conflict diamonds among international bodies such as the Kimberley Process (KP) Certification Scheme, the World Diamond Council (WDC) and the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB). ;J.

eldis:A19115;Rain, prosperity and peace;;"This report provides a record of the Global Pastoralist Gathering, an event which brought together more than 200 pastoralists and their supporters from 23 countries to raise the profile and voice of pastoralists in governance and policy processes around the world. In a series of short articles, the report sets out the perspectives of pastoralist leaders from countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.There area number of key issues that were identified during the gathering which concern pastoralists around the world. These issues include:while many pastoralists are suffering decline of their way of life through lack of representation and loss of resources, others have found ways of organising to lobby and co-operate with governments; creating laws, policies and services that promote pastoralist livelihoods without change, by 2015 access to education, health, clean water, economic progress and legal protection will have declined in pastoralist areaswithout change not only pastoralist people and their animals will suffer, but also the fragile environments in which they live will have degraded and the markets which they serve will declinethe decline of pastoralists’ conditions will affect national economies and societies in their entirety, increasing gaps between poor pastoralists and rich others, increasing frustration at erosion of rights and loss of land and increasing destitution will lead to conflict and migration countries with pastoralist populations will not be able to claim achievement of the Millennium Development Goals unless a new emphasis is placed on providing the services, markets, mobility and representation that the people need.Pastoralists at the Global Gathering called for further opportunities for pastoralists to meet one another at global and regional levels; and pastoralist leaders wish to continue sharing knowledge and developing collaboration among themselves and with governments and international agencies.

It argues that that conflict has grown rapidly in Africa in the least three decades, and pastoral areas are among the most vulnerable. For this reason, there is an urgent need for a stocktaking of contemporary analysis of conflict. This paper  maps the state of knowledge, to identifies important gaps in understanding, and suggests promising avenues for future practical work.It specifically explores the literature referring to pastoral conflict in north Kenya, concerning:the prominent actors involved in the conflict inthe importance of the national political situationthe effect of international influencesthe outcomes of pastoral conflictthe construction of a typology of violent pastoral conflictmajor changes in pastoral conflict over timethe importance of the advent of automatic weaponsdifferent analytical perspectives on conflict over resource tenure and usethe breakdown of the ability of customary institutions to manage conflictthe potential role in pastoral conflict for agenciesThe literature synthesises typical recommendations made in order to establish more efficient conflict management mechanisms. These include:give support to participatory  development  planning to  prepare conflict  management components of wider development plans and policies, and to assess the likely impact of development activities on conflictintegrate conflict management and reduction goals and activities into the national poverty eradication plan as it is implemented, especially: incorporate conflict management considerations into pilot field demonstration projects and into selection of geographic and sector targets for the plan; provide training on conflict management within wider poverty training for senior civil servantsdevelop strategies and methods for more successful development in conflict-prone arid districts, including improved natural resource tenure, food security, marketing and creditsupport preparation of case studies of the links between conflict and povertyexplore regional support to conflict managementdevelop a conflict impact analysis procedure for all new projects ";"S.

eldis:A58124;Gender, water and livelihoods in Mseleni: a case study;;"Access to sufficient water to meet basic needs has been identified as a critical development issue and a human right. This study set out to investigate the dynamic relationship between gender, water and livelihoods in a traditional, rural community in South Africa.The paper finds that: 

    access to a reliable, sufficient water supply increases the range of possible livelihood activities and has a ‘multiplier’ effect on livelihood outcomes
    poor water access results in health, opportunity and financial costs and furthermore, constrains livelihood activities; in particular agriculture
    the factors affecting access to and control over resources result in uneven accruement of the positive and negative water and livelihoods linkages
    these factors comprise inter and intra-household hierarchies: gender, age, social status and class
    in this respect, women and children are largely responsible for water collection and women for managing household water
    still, technology, transport and money are potential levers which can alter the social relations of access

Recommendations to enhance livelihoods and advance gender equity are:

    factoring livelihoods water uses into definitions of basic needs and humans rights, norms, standards, policies and programmes
    working towards a more nuanced understanding of power relations at household and community level which influence water access and livelihood outcomes
    the equitable roll-out of simple technologies, infrastructure and transport to deep rural areas in order to make water for livelihoods more accessible.

eldis:A76291; Flooded cities;;"Does economic activity relocate away from areas that are at high risk of recurring shocks? We examine this question in the context of floods, which are among the costliest and most common natural disasters. Over the past thirty years, floods worldwide killed more than 500,000 people and displaced over 650,000,000 people. This paper analyzes the effect of large scale floods, which displaced at least 100,000 people each, in over 1,800 cities in 40 countries, from 2003 -2008. We conduct our analysis using spatial ly detailed inundation maps and night lights data spanning the globe's urban areas. We find that low elevation areas are about 3 -4 times more likely to be hit by large floods than other areas, and yet they concentrate more economic activity per square kilometre . When cities are hit by large floods, the low elevation areas also sustain more damage, but like the rest of the flooded cities they recover rapidly, and economic activity does not move to safer areas. Only in more recently populated urban areas, flo oded areas show a larger and more persistent decline in economic activity. Our findings have important policy implications for aid, development and urban planning in a world with rising urbanization and sea levels.

eldis:A65383;Agricultural water storage in an era of climate change: assessing need and effectiveness in Africa;;The Sri Lankan based International Water Management Institute (IWMI) has produced this report assessing the need and effectiveness of agricultural water storage (AWS) in Africa, in the context of climate change risks. Widely anticipated to make a key contribution to climate change adaptation through the mitigation of climate variability, AWS will have to significantly improve if it is to achieve intended benefits. The authors begin by describing different AWS options available, covering reservoirs, ponds and tanks, aquifers, soil moisture, and natural wetlands, and outlining the potential impacts of climate change for each. By modifying both the availability and demand of water, climate change makes all AWS options potentially vulnerable in terms of performance, cost, and adverse effects. Also described is the development of a diagnostic tool based on biophysical and demographic indicators, designed to provide fast, ‘first-cut’ evaluations on the need for and effectiveness of different AWS options. This diagnostic tool was applied to sub-Saharan Africa and, in more detail, to the Volta Basin and the Ethiopian portion of the Blue Nile Basin. The findings concluded that the greatest need for AWS was in the Sahelian zone, the Horn of Africa, and southern Africa, with localised hotspots in Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Malawi, and Mozambique. Population density was the primary indicator of need in Ethiopia and Ghana, rather than areas with the least rainfall as might have been anticipated. The study concludes that ,under a ‘middle impact’ climate change scenario, the effectiveness of AWS will decrease in both the Volta Basin and the Blue Nile Basin. The authors note that this approach requires refinement through further research and more testing in real planning situations. Nevertheless, it can provide a first-step toward a more rigorous approach to future AWS planning. ;"M. McCartney

eldis:A11667;Whose business?: a handbook on corporate responsibility for human rights and the environment;;This handbook aims to provide an introduction to the key issues driving efforts to promote corporate social responsibility and accountability worldwide. It focuses especially on the links between the environment, labor rights, and human rights in the context of globalisation.The central theme of this handbook is that the institutions and regulatory frameworks now governing the global economy have not adequately protected human rights, the environment, and labor rights. Free markets are not really free: they merely privatize the benefits of globalisation, while socialising the human and environmental costs. Moving to a new paradigm of socially responsible business will require a creative and synergistic combination of popular pressure, corporate initiative, and global regulation. The handbook describes actions being taken at all three levels.Three case studies of oil company operations spanning Nigeria, Ecuador and the Caspian, and four case studies of high tech company operations spanning India, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan are incorporated along with studies from other industries.The handbook includes the following chapters:chapter one examines the global context in which multinational corporations operatechapter two outlines the connections among the environmental, labor, and human rights issues that plague MNC operations in developing countrieschapter three focuses on the emerging movement to increase the social responsibility and accountability of MNCs. It looks at the tactics and strategies employed by external sources—activists, nonprofit advocates—as well as those used by internal stakeholders—workers, investors, shareholders, and corporate managers themselves. This chapter also discusses how corporations have responded by adopting codes of conduct and exploring other ways to go beyond compliance with existing regulationschapter four examines efforts to set new global rules and guidelines for MNCs. Drawing from existing and emerging international law and agreements, these rules encompass fundamental principles of human rights, labor rights, and environmental protection. This chapter also covers right-to-know laws, which require corporations to disclose information about overseas social and environmental performanceThe handbook concludes by suggesting that businesses and civil society groups must refine and redouble their efforts to change, and that any effort to create global standards must be a collaboration among all stakeholders. Public education at all levels—high school, university, adult school, and popular education—is at the center of winning hearts and minds. Young people have an especially important role to play. ;"S.

eldis:A11661;Oil for nothing: multinational corporations, environmental destruction, death and impunity in the Niger Delta;;"This paper reports the findings of a US delegation to the Niger Delta to investigate the environmental and human rights record of oil corporations.Evidence shows that the oil companies operating in Nigeria
have not only disregarded their responsibility towards the
environment but have acted in complicity with the military’s
repression of Nigerian citizens. The profit-driven collusion between multinational oil companies and the past and present Nigerian governments has cost many lives and continues to threaten the stability of the region.The key findings of the delegation include:oil corporations in the Niger Delta seriously threaten the livelihood of neighboring local communities. Large scale environmental pollution is evident in the region, fishing and farming have become impossible or extremely difficult in oil-affected areas, and even drinking water has become scarcethe presence of multinational oil companies has had additional adverse effects on the local economy and society, including loss of property, price inflation, prostitution, and irresponsible fathering by expatriate oil workersorganised protest and activism by affected communities regularly meet with military repression, sometimes ending in the loss of life. In some cases military forces have been summoned and assisted by oil companiesreporting on the situation is extremely difficult, due to the existence of physical and legal constraints to free passage and free circulation of information. Similar constraints discourage grassroots activismEnvironmental and social justice for the people of the Niger Delta remain central issues for achieving peace in the region. As long as people’s calls for justice continue to be ignored and resisted by both multinational oil corporations and the Nigerian government, the situation in the Delta can only deteriorate.The authors conclude that the survival of a large number of Niger Delta communities is now dependent on their ability to establish
their entitlement to local resources.

It highlights that such environmental changes may aggravate political tensions, especially in regions that are not equipped with an appropriate institutional apparatus.

This paper argues that the best attempts to assess the ability of states to deal with water variability in the future rest with considering how agreements have fared in the past. The paper investigates to what extent particular mechanisms and institutional designs help mitigate inter-country tensions over shared water. The study’s findings suggest that country dyads governed by treaties with water allocation mechanisms exhibiting both flexibility and specificity evince more co-operative behaviour. Country dyads governed by treaties with a larger sum of institutional mechanisms likewise evince a higher level of cooperation, although certain institutional mechanisms are more important than others.

eldis:A100475;A stitch in time: preventive diplomacy and the Lake Malawi dispute;;A low-intensity dispute between Malawi and Tanzania threatens regional peace as the two countries contest the demarcation of their national boundaries at Lake Malawi. This long-standing dispute became more urgent when in 2011 the Malawian government issued licences for oil prospecting beneath the lake’s northern shoreline. Although tensions have waxed and waned in accordance with the respective countries’ election cycles, both seek a speedy resolution of this dispute. Potential oil revenues are a significant game changer for these two highly indebted poor countries – but perhaps more so for Malawi, which is less endowed with natural resources. In the absence of a functioning SADC Tribunal to mediate the dispute, the task has been assigned to the Forum for Former African Heads of State and Government, but there are also other regional mechanisms that could assist with the task. In particular, it falls within the purview of the many early-warning mechanisms in SADC and the AU that already exist and whose raison d’être is to prevent the escalation of disputes. This paper explores the failures and challenges that plague Africa’s preventive diplomacy institutions and advocates that the region would do well to empower these institutions. This would foster stronger and more legitimate regional institutions that would be better able to act decisively on dispute settlement. It is apparent from this paper that there are a number of bodies that are concerned with the resolution of disputes such as the one posed by the Lake Malawi/Nyasa dispute. Although these institutions are aware of the problem to varying degrees, there is little to suggest that they are able to co-ordinate efforts among themselves, or in the service of the governments in question. Arguably, the fortification of these institutions at regional and sub-regional levels would depoliticise much of the process and inch the continent towards stronger, more transparent and democratic outcomes. ;A.

eldis:A75472;A plan for the development and supply of agricultural water ;;"The agricultural policies after Independence in South Korea can be roughly classified into three policies: policies for food increase till the 1970s, policies for structural improvement in the 1980s and 1990s, and policies for rice production adjustment in the 2000s. In the process, a policy for price support to encourage food production and increase farmer income, the policies for modernization of production processes, and the policies for expanding the scale of management were made and implemented. In recent years, the policies for direct payment and a policy for eco-friendly farming were introduced to cope with the waves of free international trade of agricultural products and global competition.

This paper summarises the processes in which the Korean government and farmers have made strenuous efforts to realize a dream of “green revolutions” by banding with each other to overcome hardships and challenges.

eldis:A33086;Anglo American: the alternative report;;"This report documents the performance of the world’s second largest mining company with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Despite Anglo American’s participation in various voluntary CSR initiatives, it continues to abuse human rights, fuel conflict and damage the local environment and livelihoods. The report documents a number of Anglo American’s activities which highlight that there is still a long way to go as far as the company's commitment to CSR, including: 

    trade unionists who have protested against AngloGold Ashanti mining operations in Colombia have been murdered by military units assigned to protect the company 
    AngloGold Ashanti has links with armed groups responsible for human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo 
    in the Philippines and South Africa, local communities threatened with Anglo American mines have faced severe repression in their fight to stay on their land 
    in Ghana, mining operations have devastated the environment and polluted vital water resources 

The UK government’s opposition to a binding framework for corporate accountability enables companies such as Anglo American to continue to acquire vast wealth at the expense of the security and human rights of the communities in which it operates. The report insists that the UK government must state its support for international, legally binding regulation so that companies like Anglo American can be made accountable for their actions around the world.

eldis:A65403;Nationally appropriate mitigation actions for grassland and livestock management in Mongolia;;"This policy brief by the Asian Development Bank argues that, given the negative impact of climate change on Mongolia, it is crucial to select mitigation actions that reduce vulnerability to climate change, support the achievement of national development goals, and are feasible given local constraints.

Key messages from the brief include:

• Mongolia’s total emissions are low, but its emissions per capita are relatively high and rising and are produced primarily by the energy and agriculture sectors.

• Nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) can help provide access to international financing.

• Mongolia’s NAMA for the management of its grassland and livestock sectors should be based on its National Livestock Program.

• Implementation of Mongolia’s NAMAs should be phased, with three categories of activities — quick wins, fast-tracked actions, and key medium-term actions.

• Mongolia needs to develop a credible measurement, reporting, and verification system, and strengthen institutional capacity.

Ten case studies were conducted in variouscountries in the he Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Saheland at UN and EU level. These investigate whether the link between climate change and human security/conflict is being addressed through targeted policies. The studies show that so far there are few specific policies addressing this interface. However, policies such as a Turkish agricultural insurance scheme and the creation of water user associations in Egypt highlight that even policies not explicitly aimed at preventing conflicts or risks to human security may have beneficial impacts to this end. ;C Gerstetter;;Clico;eldis;01/01/2011;en;"climate change;research";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A59614;http://www.clico.org/component/docman/doc_download/19-2nd-policy-brief-june-2011;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clico.org%2Fcomponent%2Fdocman%2Fdoc_download%2F19-2nd-policy-brief-june-2011;;;;"theme:cc conflict;Water in climate change;Climate change;research;Climate change mitigation;Climate Change Adaptation;tfmimport"
eldis:A27019;The concept of rangeland carrying capacity in sub-saharan Africa: Myth or reality?;;"Ever since colonial administrators and western trained scientists became involved in sub-Saharan Africa in the early 20th century and were faced with the task of governing countries where livestock production was a major economic enterprise, the proper utilisation of rangelands became a major concern. While during most of the colonial era devastating epidemics (like rinderpest and pleuropneumonia) kept the growth of livestock populations in check, during the 1950s and 1960s regional campaigns of eradicating these major cattle diseases created a continuous increase in livestock numbers. It is estimated that between 1963 and 1970 annual growth of cattle populations averaged 2.8%, but slowed down to 1.25% per annum during 1970 to 1980 (Antenneh 1984).While up to the 1950s constraints of feed shortages for livestock were outweighed by those of disease, concern over looming imbalances between supply and demand of grazing resources led to large investments in projects of water development, many of which were financed by foreign aid. This provision of water to hitherto underutilised grazing lands further stimulated herd growth, but at the same time encouraged more settled modes of production and reduced mobility. While watering rights of man-made traditional wells were tightly enforced and served as a control on over-exploitation, water sources that were publicly financed were open to all, breaking the age-old equilibrium between water and rangeland use (Sandford 1983, Swift 1984).The need for establishing criteria and ways for determining the carrying capacity of African rangelands became more strongly felt when in the 1960s and 1970s several regions were hit by droughts (1960 to 1961, 1973 to 1976 in East Africa; 1969 to 1973, 1979 in West Africa) causing enormous stock losses.This paper investigates common approaches to determine carrying capacity, elucidates the problems associated with applying the concept in sub-Saharan Africa, and suggests ways of broadening the concept to improve its applicability in this continent.

eldis:A74413;Climate change and water resources planning, development and management in Zimbabwe;;"Water is central to the Zimbabwean economy, people's livelihoods and their social well-being; its availability and reliability is a function of highly variable climatic conditions. Irrigated agriculture is the major water using sector while rain fed agriculture depends on reliable rainfall.
Agriculture not only has links to other economic sectors such as industry, but it is also important at household level because it employs the majority of the population. Power production which underpins most other production sectors depends to a large part on the flow of the Zambezi River either for hydropower generation or for the cooling of thermal power stations.
Even mining, a growth sector, ultimately relies on water for both processing and electricity production. The government of Zimbabwe has long recognized the threat from climate change and joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 2009.
It is currently preparing a National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) that is intended to mainstream climate change thinking into all key economic sectors and to bring about an integrated response across all economic sectors.
Zimbabwe strategy will largely be based around adapting to the threats from climate change so that detrimental economic and social impacts are minimized and opportunities are seized. Given the implications of climate change for the hydrological cycle and the centrality of water to the economy and to social well-being, water needs to be at the core of the NCCRS. This Issues Paper, requested by the former Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management as a recommendation of the NWP, will contribute to the NCCRS by examining opportunities for adaptation to climate change in the water resources sector, using both structural and non-structural measures. It uses models to provide preliminary estimates of the possible impacts of climate change in 2050 and 2080 on these water resources.
A number of opportunities to adapt to these impacts are discussed. Many of these adaptation opportunities constitute no-regrets actions, in that they are actions that are worth undertaking in their own right, irrespective of the severity of impacts from climate change.

eldis:A33776;China in Burma: the increasing investment of Chinese multinational corporations in Burma’s hydropower, oil and gas, and mining sectors;;"While increasing attention has been paid to Chinese attempts to secure natural resources overseas, the case of Burma has often been overlooked. This background provides a summary of the operations of Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs) in Burma in the hydro, oil & gas, and mining sectors. The research finds that more than 26 Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs) are involved in more than 62 hydropower, oil & gas, and mining projects in Burma. The report describes the activities of Chinese MNCs in Burma which include the following:

    14 Chinese companies are involved in approximately 40 hydropower projects
    the largest hydro project involving China is the Tasang Dam on the on the Salween River, which is
    China currently has at least 17 onshore and offshore oil and gas projects in Burma, with investment from at least seven companies, including the three major Chinese oil and gas companies
    Chinese MNCs have announced the construction of an oil – and a parallel natural gas – pipeline, which would stretch for 2,380 km from Burma’s Arakan coast to China’s southwestern cities of Kunming and/or Chongqing
    at least five Chinese MNCs have been involved in five major mining projects over the past three years
    the largest mining project is the Tagaung Taung nickel deposit which represents an investment of US$ 600 million. 

The paper concludes that as China increases its position and influence in the world, the country has an opportunity to create a different model of natural resource extraction and investment. The report argues that the Government of China should keep a close control and regulate its own corporations operating overseas by ensuring that MNCs: 

    abide by domestic Chinese standards
    increase transparency about operations 
    undertake environmental and social impact assessment
    mandate public participation
    do not contribute to abuses by ending partnerships with the Burmese government.

eldis:A33773;Oil and mining in violent places: why voluntary codes for companies don’t guarantee human rights;;"This paper investigates the extent to which private companies operating in conflict zones can contribute to Human Rights abuses. In addressing this issue, it focuses on four voluntary frameworks – the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Global Reporting Initiative and, most relevantly, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.The research finds that:

    it is clear from the numerous cases where extractive companies have been blamed for complicity in human rights abuses, there are grounds for serious concern about the human rights implications of companies’ operations
    in response to this, many major extractive companies have signed up to voluntary human rights frameworks of the kind described in this briefing paper
    as an attempt to offer a comprehensive and credible answer, they have so far failed as no voluntary framework deals adequately with the vital issue of material support by companies to armed groups. 

The authors conclude that there needs to be an enforceable international standard which ensures that a company discloses any material support to state security forces or other armed groups and shows that such support has been provided to meet an explicit legal requirement.

eldis:A35175;Access to water - the impact of climate change on small municipalities;;"Although there are many uncertainties around quantitative assessments of climate change impact and water resource management, what is certain is that the climate is changing and this will have an effect on water resources. 
This case study considers the economic consequences of water resource scarcity, particularly as it relates to the poor and small municipalities. The author is concerned that, in the case of water, economic principles where price adjustments to an increasingly scarce resource will balance demand, do not apply. 
Currently, most countries adopt free or subsidised water for the poor which is accommodated through a cross subsidy within the municipal tariff structure. However, the likely rate of increase in tariff due to water scarcity resulting from (projected) reduced rainfall will be too much of a burden for the small number of high-end users in small municipalities. Coupled with inflationary increases, the majority middle- and low-end users are also unlikely to be able to meet the dramatic increases. The methodology outlined in this paper will assist municipal planners to evaluate these financial impacts due to climate change and develop appropriate strategies to ensure the sustainability and affordability of long term water supplies. In addition, policy intervention at a national level may be needed in order to sustain small communities’ ability to provide affordable water to their poorer members.  ";P.

eldis:A40627;From risk to resilience: Understanding the costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction under changing climatic conditions;;"This paper evaluates the costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction in the context of climate change through an analysis of case studies in India, Nepal and Pakistan. The paper focuses on water related disasters and the manner in which they may change as a consequence of climate change. The paper highlights that the evidence presenting the economic impacts of climate change and disasters is accumulating rapidly. It is now widely recognized that recurrent disasters represent a major factor in undermining the ability of regions, nations and the global community to meet basic development goals. As a result, there is both a need and a demand for analytical frameworks such as cost benefit analysis that can support decision-making with regard to investments in climate and other disaster risk reduction investments.The methodological approach of the paper has the following key elements:

    scoping: an intensive scoping process to identify locations and risks that can form a representative basis for detailed cases
    vulnerability and capacity analysis: a systematic process within case study areas, including development of semi-quantitative vulnerability indices, to identify vulnerable groups and the different dimensions of vulnerability
    shared learning dialogues within identified case areas: continuous meetings with communities and key actors that allow the movement from the analysis of vulnerability to clear identification of the alternative strategies for disaster risk reduction 
    systematic qualitative approaches for evaluating trade-offs (broad costs and benefits) between alternative strategies for risk reduction: who benefits, who loses and why?
    Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) using quantitative probabilistic techniques for evaluating the costs and benefits of different approaches to disaster risk reduction. A core economic and hazard-modeling element and includes techniques for evaluating the impacts of climate change in data limited context.

The paper concludes that, the benefits of investing in disaster risk management substantially exceed the costs. In most cases investigated, benefit/cost ratios are positive and in some instances may be well above those achieved through other common development investments. This finding holds true for an array of interventions that range across a spectrum from insurance to early warning and from distributed responses at the village level to large-scale infrastructure. Investing in lower cost forms of risk reduction that are designed to increase the resiliency of livelihoods, housing and other infrastructure at the household and community level may be among the most economically effective avenues for reducing risks and thereby supporting adaptation to climate change.

eldis:A69777;Land valuation and perceptions of land sales prohibition in Ethiopia;;"This study investigates attitudes towards legalizing land sales and Willingness to Accept (WTA) sales prices and compensation prices for land among smallholder households in four different areas in the Oromia and SNNP Regions in the southern highlands of Ethiopia.

Household panel data from 2007 and 2012 are used. The large majority of the sample prefers land sales to remain illegal, and the resistance to legalizing land sales increased from 2007 to 2012. In the same period, perceived median real land values increased sharply but also exhibit substantial local variation.

Land loss aversion is associated with higher land values and less willingness to sell land if land sales were to become legal. The substantial increase in perceived land values, high economic growth and outmigration of youth have yet to persuade the rural population in southern Ethiopia to open the land sales market.

eldis:A72959;Irresponsible investment: AGRICA's broken development model in Tanzania;;"Kilombero Plantations Ltd (KPL) is a 5,818 hectare (ha) rice plantation located in the heart of the fertile Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. In addition to developing a large-scale rice farm, KPL works with local smallholder farmers through an outgrower model based on System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technologies. The investment project receives considerable financial and technical support from various development institutions including the UK Department for International Development (DfID) and USAID.  This report presents the findings of an investigation carried out in Tanzania between 2011 and 2015 of KPL’s investment venture, focusing on the impacts experienced by surrounding communities.
The major findings of the report are as follows: First, while KPL is often portrayed as a truly responsible investment venture, villagers in the surrounding communities complain of adverse impacts on their livelihoods resulting from KPL’s acquisition of land. Despite the adoption of World Bank guidelines on involuntary resettlement which promises to improve, or at least restore, livelihoods of project-affected people, KPL has, in many cases, allegedly failed to safeguard the interests of local communities who instead report losses. Compensation offered for the loss of land and houses appears to have been largely underestimated, not allowing those displaced by the project to get access to adequate alternative land for their livelihoods.
Second, KPL’s SRI outgrower scheme was introduced as a way of complementing production on nucleus farms and to provide opportunities to local farmers. With the implementation of new technologies, farmers report improved yields and have even been found to outperform the KPL nucleus farm in terms of productivity per hectare. Despite an improvement in yields, local farmers allege that the outgrower scheme has left many in despair. Struggling with debt repayments, farmers report being forced into distress sales of their belongings. These problems are seemingly related to the outgrower contracts that smallholders entered into with KPL. In addition, according to previous employees, plantation employment has failed to generate tangible benefits for the local community due to low salaries and limited opportunities for recruitment to full-time positions.
Third, this report raises concerns about the environmental impact of the project in an area of high ecological and biodiversity value. The prolonged use of agro-chemicals raises concerns about the presence of their compounds in soil and water and the pollution of nearby rivers, streams, and wetland areas used by the local communities. Villagers surrounding the plantation allege having experienced several negative effects from KPL’s agro-chemical application regime due to drifting and surface run-off. Moreover, KPL’s future plans to utilize the nearby Mngeta River for irrigation are worrisome in a context where there is limited reliable information of both water availability and the water requirements of the complex floodplain ecosystem and downstream users. Experts claim that the Mngeta River is already experiencing effects of climate change.
In conclusion, this report illustrates the difficulties in creating beneficial synergies and balance between the interests of smallholder farmers and those of large-scale agribusinesses. It critically questions the role of large-scale farms in agricultural development as they tend to create more problems than they solve, even when they attempt to include small-scale farmers in their strategy. The findings presented in this report cast serious doubt on the substantial aid money directed towards supporting corporate-led agricultural development. This is especially relevant in the broader Tanzanian development context where large-scale agribusinesses are envisioned greater roles.

The report has primarily collated information from investigative studies that have been conducted in DFID priority countries of sub-Saharan Africa; additional information from key studies is also provided for South and
South East Asia DFID countries.

The information has primarily been gathered from the peer reviewed literature, but also from reports of accredited organisations such as WHO, UNEP, World Bank). The report uses literature published over the last 5 to 8 years.

The report is not intended to be a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature but rather a review that identifies a number of particular pathways that represent the variety in the biophysical, socio-economic and political constructs by which pollution and environmental degradation influence human-wellbeing and poverty.

eldis:A11346;Shifting sands: oil exploration in the Rift Valley and the Congo conflict;;"This paper addresses the impact of the oil exploration in the Rift Valley (East Congo) on the crisis in the country.  It demonstrates that major new conflict has broken out in the Congolese area concerned, endangering the whole peace process for the Democratic Republic of Congo and making a renewed cross-border conflict involving Uganda and Rwanda at least a possibility.The paper further demonstrates that more general problems known from oil exploration elsewhere in Africa are not only unresolved but might never be resolved. The sharing of costs and benefits of oil development is a key issue in all oil producing countries. In Uganda and the Congo, this is not even close to being addressed. In Uganda the ongoing inconclusive debate on the political future of the country makes it impossible to determine who in the future will be responsible for the minutiae of oil development or who in the long term is set to benefit. In the Democratic Republic of Congo it is not even settled who runs the area concerned, and even if it was, the determination of local interests and their expression in any form of political process would remain completely open.The paper recommends that economic reconstruction in the Great Lakes can only take place in a beneficial manner if it comes from the bottom up, deriving from local economic activities and interests. This does not preclude the exploitation of the region’s natural resources; it means that the local population should be enabled to take decisions about such exploitation and should enjoy its fruits. What is clear that if oil exploration is ever to proceed, there must be another way than armed conflict to include the expression of local interests. ";D.

eldis:A101128;South Africa’s drought preparedness in the water sector: too little too late? ;;South Africa experiences droughts on a regular basis, often associated with significant negative impacts on society and the economy. Droughts can be forecast, and South African climate scientists have been developing computer-generated models to forecast El Niño-induced droughts. Even so, there is a tendency to implement remedial interventions when droughts occur, rather than implementing proactive and preventative strategies. Being reactive seems to be a defining feature of South African water-resource management. This has also been the case with the 2015/2016 drought. What is more, the forecasting capability of South Africa seems to be under strain as more and more weather monitoring stations and river gauges are stolen or vandalised and not replaced. This makes it difficult to gather data for extreme weather event forecasting. One way of increasing this capability is through collaboration with citizens to build a citizen-science data repository. This can enhance scientists’ and the government’s capacity to forecast droughts.Recommendations:South Africa should adopt a long-term, national drought policy and strategy to improve the country’s response to future droughtsthe computer-generated models that determine operating rules, which influence water restrictions for various users, need regular updating and improvementthe drought response unit of the DWS needs to become more proactive in its preparedness for droughtsa formalised knowledge exchange platform should be established that consolidates scientific and modelling forecasting capability in support of drought preparedness ;"R.

eldis:A41531;Integrating women into mining operations: the examples of Newmont Ghana and Lonmin South Africa;;"Mining has not always had good press in the development arena, due to a history of inadequate environmental and social governance. This short paper argues that there is enormous opportunity to be had in including women in mining operations. The author looks at how International Finance Corporations’ (IFC) Gender Program was able to implement strategies to help two IFC mining clients better integrate women into their operations. The author highlights how in so doing, IFC has contributed to the clients’ sustainability objectives and to improved performance through greater gender diversity. The document also shows how important it is to be flexible when dealing with clients who have different impulses and requirements, and how to leverage colleagues for greater mainstreaming.The paper considers how to identify the drivers and market realities and lists 3 lessons learnt in the process: 

    for quick wins, start by implementing feasible objectives derived from client priorities 
    partner with other IFC colleagues to amplify actions and ensure greater gender mainstreaming 
    listen, stay open to understand differing compulsions and strategies, and adjust and work in an incremental fashion, where required.

eldis:A75079;National industrialization in Philippine mining: review and suggestions ;;"Among the most daunting constraints mining has been facing is that it is a
generally extractive activity the way it has been traditionally practiced. This makes the country a mere exporter of raw materials to industrialized countries and unable to benefit from value-addition. To help address this problem, the national government has recently pronounced a long-term strategy of national industrialization in the mining sector. Among others, this strategy is intended to enable the sector to expand into processing3 and other downstream activities and transform lowvalue outputs of raw materials into processed products with higher value-added.

The paper reviewed national industrialization as a long-term strategy of mining development in the Philippines. The end purpose was to suggest immediate actions that can be undertaken for the promotion of national industrialization. The paper used secondary data and information from institutional sources and available relevant literature as well as primary data and information from institutional key informants.

The paper found that the knowledge base of the country required to pursue the national industrialization strategy is poor. The following studies therefore were suggested


	value chain analysis for the mining sector and its sub-sectors, including but not limited to the copper, nickel, gold and chromite industries
	development of community-based small and medium-scale operations in mining including the technology, financial, institutional and other forms of government support that could be provided to them
	analysis of resource rents in the mining sector and its subsectors that will determine, among others, how much royalty tax should be imposed on them
	evaluation of the appropriated export restrictions that may be imposed on the mining sector taking into consideration their economic, social and other impacts


In addition to the aforementioned research activities, the paper supports the institutional improvements that have been suggested by previous works. These include the strengthening of the organizational, legal, monitoring and enforcement other aspects of governance performed by government mining agencies.

eldis:A33927;The impact of extractive industry activities on the rights of local communities;;"Does Anvil Mining, a multinational company which has been extracting copper since 2002 from a mine in Dikulushi impact positively or negatively on the lives or rights of the local populations? The study argues that the impact of Anvil has been not been as problematic compared to other mining companies as the company has been adhering to relevant national and international norms and standards such as the OECD guiding principles. The study also points out that the authorities need to do more to makes sure international and national standards and norms are respected.
Key findings include: 

    the social projects developed by Anvil Mining are not sustainable in that, to this day, they are conceived and managed by the company with no involvement by the communities in the actual mechanics of their management, neither during nor after the mining is completed 
    currently, Anvil Mining has no programme which could allow it to contribute in any coherent manner to the development of the communities of Dikulushi 
    due to certain social projects, some rights of the community have been improved (health, employment, clean drinking water, and a secure working environment) while other rights have been negatively affected, or have not seen much improvement (rhousing, ownership of property, healthy environment) 

The authors recommend that Anvil Mining:

    carries out its activities in accordance with the national and international norms relating to mining
    devises a development programme for local communities who are affected by the mining project, in consultation with the beneficiaries, which is in accordance with the guiding principles of the OECD, the mining code, and the mining regulations of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
    makes this programme available to the local communities and civil society, with the aim of allowing them to establish its conditions 
    promotes involvement by members of the local community, religious and traditional leaders, and local authorities in the conceptualisation and fulfilment of social project

eldis:A16282;A conflict of interests: the uncertain future of Burma's forests;;"Burma is resource rich, and principal among these resources is timber. This report, based on research and fieldwork carried out by Global Witness  in Burma, Thailand and China, examines the roots of the civil war and how conflict and an authoritarian regime (the State Peace and Development Council - SPDC) have been sustained through the exploitation of Burma’s natural resources.The paper argues that Burma is the epitome of unrealised potential - a poor country rich in natural resources and social capital. Historically struggles over the control of natural resources have been a primary cause of war in Burma  and addressing both ethnic concerns and the manner in which natural resources are exploited will be pivotal for the future of peace and development in the country.The report makes a number of recommendations to key players, including action points for the international community:increase the provision of aid directly to the people of Burma, following stakeholder consultation, in a way that prevents its diversion and that does not perpetuate military rule and human rights abuseprovide support for Burmese independent NGOs, in the form of technical assistance, to raise their capacity to administer their humanitarian programmes and to manage increasing levels of foreign funding.To achieve equitable and sustainable management of Burma’s forests, the International Community should:ensure that timber imported from Burma does not fund conflict, or lead to human rights abuse or increased poverty, and that it is harvested from a legal, sustainably managed source and produced in accordance with Burma’s international obligationsmake all data relating to the importation of timber from Burma publicly available; including volumes, value, and originFacilitate a forest sector review and forest value assessment, to determine how to protect and sustainably manage all of Burma’s forests in the best interests of the people of Burma. This should include a forest cover survey and meaningful public consultation.In relation to the equitable and sustainable management of Burma’s forests, the SPDC should:implement the results of the proposed forest sector review and forest value assessment, increase transparency and accountability. This should include the cessation of all unsustainable logging practices and logging that is detrimental to the best interests of the peoples of Burmaensure the formal participation of local communities in the decision-making process relating to forest conservation and exploitation.[adapted from author] ";;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"environment;conflict of interest";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16282;http://www.globalwitness.org/reports/index.php?section=burma;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Freports%2Findex.php%3Fsection%3Dburma;;;;"Burma;Business and conflict;biodiversity;Conflict and security;geopolitics;New wars;ethical business;Drivers of conflict;Environment;Business and the environment;natural resources as driver of conflict;Corporate Social Responsibility;Biodiversity and environment;Security;natural resource;conflict;timber"

eldis:A25134;Understanding and promoting range management by herders in Eastern Turkey;;This paper describes the pastoral situation in Erzurum Province,  Anatolia, Turkey, and gives an account of some of the existing range management practices.It emphasises the necessity of understanding existing pastoral practices, and more importantly the circumstances that give rise to them, when planning the improvement of livestock husbandry, breeding, fodder production and pasture management. Erzurum province is one of the most important areas in Turkey for the production of sheep and cattle for fattening and slaughter. Not only is it important as a source of red meat and store animals for the domestic market, but also for export to Turkey's eastern neighbours. In addition the herds of cattle and more especially the flocks of sheep, produce dairy products, mainly cheese as well as carpet wool. Livestock husbandry practices are still based almost exclusively on the seasonal use of rangelands, alpine pastures and hay meadows supplemented wherever possible by planted fodder and fodder grain crops: irrigated lucerne, dry land sainfoin and vetches, barley and rye. This feed base is however recognised as being inadequate for the numbers of stock involved, especially through the long harsh east Anatolian winter, when the resident village flocks and herds are housed in dark and primitive stables. Much of the range-land is degraded, overstocked and over-grazed. Furthermore much of the hay crop is sold out of the Province for cash, leaving many of the resident herds and flocks to survive the winter on a diet based largely on chopped straw. ;A.

eldis:A68414;Water, food and energy nexus challenges;;"Comprehensive yet concise report outlining the key challenges and projected demands in the global agricultural sector, from an energy-water-food nexus perspective.
Based on several existing data-sets, this paper by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development seeks to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of the main challenges associated with increasing demand for agricultural products. The authors use the concept of a water-energy-food nexus, viewing agriculture in a multi-sectoral and integrated fashion that incorporates land management, water use, demand projections, energy use, markets, climate change impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions . The paper assumes a business-as-usual scenario in formulating projected supply and demand trends and climate change impacts, indicating the need for a proposed “Green New Deal” that tackles multiple areas simultaneously to tap into different cost and benefit streams and enhance co-optimisation. 
The report summarises the projections and challenges, including that:
Food demand is expected to increase by 60 per cent by 2050 compared to 2005-2007 levels, due to population growth (70 per cent) and increased per capita calorie intake (30 per cent). Global meat demand is expected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030.
Demand for roundwood, wood panels, and paper are expected to rise between 1 per cent and 4.1 per cent annually for the next two decades, while demand for biofuel is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. 
Around 90 per cent of the required increase of food production has to come from intensification. While globally arable land is expected to increase in by 4.5 per cent, in developed countries it is expected to decrease by 40 million hectares.  
Regarding impacts on water, it is expected that by 2050, irrigated agriculture covering 16 per cent of cultivated land will be responsible for 44 per cent of all crop production. However, greater competition for water from other sectors could reduce the water available for agriculture by 18 per cent.
Climate change impacts on agriculture include higher temperatures leading to more variable annual production levels, decreasing yields and nutritional value of crops, and increased costs and fertiliser use.  
Global energy demand is projected to increase by 80% by 2050. The food sector currently accounts for 30 per cent of global energy use, and agricultural commodity prices are highly sensitive to energy prices.
Energy and the food system, including land-use change, account for almost half of global greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, emissions will increase by 50% between 2012 and 2050.
Increased salinity of soil, the build-up of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds through agricultural water pollution, and drinking water contaminated with high nitrate concentrations all pose significant challenges.

eldis:A63332;Climate change: impact, adaptation and vulnerability in water supply of Kathmandu Valley;;Climate change can affect water supply in Nepal by its impact on precipitation, glacier melting and increase in temperature. This study identifies the vulnerability of the water supply system in Kathmandu Valley to the impact of the worst case scenario of climate change and suggests adaptation strategies to deal with the situation. It finds that existing strategies are insufficient and more than five million people would be deprived of the minimum needed water by 2050 under the driest scenario. Similarly, the reduction in low flow under the driest scenario or frequent extreme rainfall events under the wettest scenario could further degrade the water quality and increase the vulnerability of water supply infrastructures. The study suggests a combination of strategies to help manage the situation until 2050. The situation, however, would become worse after 2050 due to the projected sharp reduction in precipitation, making all precipitation-dependent water supply strategies ineffective. ;P. K.

Indeed international financial institutions have failed to sufficiently recognise and act upon a number of risks that are inherent in any investment in the Indonesian pulp and paper industry. These risks are identified as follows:unsustainable supply of raw materialsillegal loggingdistorted global paper marketpoor financial regulationhidden debt burdendebt-driven expansionsocial conflictAPP & covert marketingAs a result of their inadequate investigation and understanding of the Indonesian pulp and paper industry, combined with their substantial investment in those companies over a number of years, financial institutions must accept their share of the responsibility for the crisis facing APP. Lessons in risk learned from the APP crisis should be applied by financial institutions to all their pulp and paper investments. Without ensuring that their investments are both socially and environmentally sustainable, their investments will not be economically sustainable.Recommendations for financial institutions:to help minimise risk and ensure the sustainability of APP and the pulp and paper industry both in Indonesia and other parts of the world, financial institutions are urged to undertake the following recommendations:financial institutions should adopt and enforce more effective due diligence practices to fully assess the financial risks involved with the pulp and paper sector and to ensure that they are not providing funds for illegal or unsustainable practicesfinancial institutions should not provide funds for any new pulp and paper processing capacity in Indonesia and Malaysia for the forseeable future. This should include halting investment in Borneo Pulp and Paper in Sarawak (Malaysia) and two other proposed pulp and paper plants in Kalakaban in Sabah (Malaysia) and at Sungai Danau in Kotabaru, South Kalimantan (Indonesia)financial institutions supporting APP and its subsidiaries should take immediate action to ensure that the fibre supply to APP’s pulp mills comes from legal and sustainable sources and does not involve the destruction of any more rainforest. Financial institutions should agree upon a strategy for achieving this with APP and make the group’s raw material supply chain open to independent verification. To achieve this, financial institutions should take steps to ensure that APP’s processing capacity is reduced and / or to ensure that timber from natural forests is replaced with sustainably harvested pulpwood from independently certified sources. Reducing capacity and ensuring supplies are legal may have the benefit of helping raise global paper pricesfinancial institutions should ensure that they do not invest in pulp and paper projects that are likely to generate social conflict. In the case of APP, financial institutions should work with the group to resolve the conflict between its plantation company and the Sakai people in a manner that is equitable for the affected communitiesto ensure the long term survival of the pulp and paper industry, financial institutions should support projects that utilise agricultural waste products and recycled materials as a more sustainable raw material replacement for timber. More sustainable sources of supply often carry lower risk ;"E. Matthew

eldis:A102589;Political settlements, the mining industry and corporate social responsibility in developing countries;;In this paper the author takes a ‘political settlements’ approach to examining the political effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developing countries. The political settlements approach uses an integrated understanding of politics, power and institutional forms to explain how, given different political processes and incentives, the same institutional forms can produce different economic and developmental outcomes. The author applies this lens to the CSR practices of large mining companies in developing countries, examining their impacts on local and national political settlements using the Zambian metals mining sector as a case study. Directly, CSR features little in the national debate on natural resource governance in Zambia but local CSR activity is considerable.The author finds that the CSR practices of large metals mining companies influence the governance of extraction and the possibility of inclusive development with notable consequences for institutions of traditional leadership. The resulting pattern of inclusion and development is argued to result from the interaction of two processes - elite bargaining and coalitions within exclusionary political settlements on the one hand, and CSR practices shaped by risk management on the other. The author concludes by arguing that political settlements literature offers a rich seam for future research in the extractive sector if its limitations are addressed. ;T.

eldis:A73289;Land grabbing under the Cover of Law: Are BRICS-South relationships any different?;;"There is a general consensus among academics, politicians and social movements, that BRICS as ‘new donors’ are increasing both their quantitative and qualitative role in defining what is considered to be ‘the world economic order’.

In particular, several authors have underlined the importance of BRICS as a challenge to the traditional development paradigm, describing the five countries as proponents of a South-South cooperation which weakens the so-called Washington Consensus because it does not attach policy conditionalities, provides assistance based on a win-win paradigm, and places emphasis on how to ensure economic sustainability of the recipient country.

Moreover, such rhetoric is not only produced by academics or international financial institutions, but fostered and reinforced by BRICS themselves. For example, while China especially stresses the need to respect the sovereignty of the receiving country, all the BRICS are trying to create an identity which differs from that of established donors, and claim to promote alternative strategies based on equality, solidarity, mutual development and cooperation.

These differences from traditional Northern donors, it is assumed, contribute to more effective cooperation and to a better reception by local populations.

This chapter does not challenge the idea that some differences exist between the way in which Northern donors and BRICS conceive receiving countries’ sovereignty and their independence where official development assistance (ODA) is at stake. Rather, it focuses on large-scale investments in foreign land (LaSIL) and concludes that, when access to this scarce resource is at stake, the legal mechanisms, rhetorical approaches and geostrategic positions of the BRICS (with the exception of Russia) toward the South replicate the traditional strategy of Northern countries more than the general narrative about emerging donors may suggest.

Leaving aside the political, economic and social importance that the large-scale industrialisation of agriculture plays in transforming each of the BRICS, this chapter focuses exclusively on the ‘global land rush’, that is, the attempt to control and exploit land abroad.

eldis:A19339;The curse of gold;;This report documents human rights abuses linked to efforts to control two key gold mining areas, Mongbwalu (Ituri District) and Durba (Haut Uélé District) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Findings of the report include:competition to control the gold mines and trading routes has spurred the bloody conflict that has gripped this area since the start of the Congolese war in 1998 and continues to the presentafter 2003 two armed groups, one backed by Uganda and the other by  Rwanda, fought for the control of gold-mining areas and trade routeseach group won a gold-rich area but battles in a struggle to control Mongbwalu continued Human Rights Watch researchers documented the slaughter of at least two thousand civilians in the Mongbwalu area alone between June 2002 and September 2004 after peace talks and the installation of a transitional government, multinational corporations nonetheless sought to sign new deals to start gold mining and exploration operations in the rich gold concessions in the northeast AngloGold Ashanti, one of the largest gold producers in the world, established relations with the FNI, one of the armed group responsible for serious human rights abuses including war crimes and crimes against humanity, and who controlled the Mongbwalu area as a company with public commitments to corporate social responsibility, AngloGold Ashanti should have ensured their operations complied with those commitments and did not adversely affect human rights, but this does not seem to have been the case in 2003, an estimated $60 million worth of Congolese gold was exported from Uganda, much of it destined for Switzerland.

eldis:A15058;Deforestation, floods and state reactions in China and Thailand;;What factors motivate developing countries to prevent deforestation, which can cause serious environmental damage, such as flooding?  Do democratic states take action more effectively than authoritarian states?  This paper considers these questions using two case studies: the 1988 floods in Thailand and the 1998 floods in China, both attributed to extensive deforestation.The paper provides an overview of the state regulation of forestry and state responses to deforestation prior to the disasters in the two countries, and compares state reactions following the floods.Prior to the floods, the paper notes that both China and Thailand suffered extensive deforestation.  In both countries, the state responded with weak ‘proactive policies’, which had a limited impact on deforestation such as regulations on logging, establishment of forest reserves, reforestation programs and forests.The reasons for weak proactive policy were similar in both countries.  These include:economic development was given higher priority than environmental conservationinsufficient funds were allocated for monitoring and controlling illegal logginglocal corruption and collusion between officials and logging intereststhe desire of government to avoid unnecessary conflict with ethnic minorities in some forested regions for the sake of political stabilityThe floods in Thailand in 1988 and the floods in China in 1998 caused great damage to the local population and economy.  This led to a much stronger state reaction.  Logging was banned in both countries, leading to a fall in deforestation.Based on these two cases, the paper suggests that:deforestation in developing countries will normally induce weak proactive policies ecological disaster can stimulate strong reactive responses which produce more dramatic results in forest depletionneither democracy nor critical mass media nor activist NGOS are necessary for such a strong state response to occur The paper concludes that in general, both authoritarian and democratic states in developing countries are too committed to short term economic goals to impose more than weak proactive environmentalist policies.  However, environmental disasters, such as floods, by threatening national economic well being, and thereby, regime survival can lead to much stronger state reactions. ;G.

It concludes that there is a significant association between mean annual river level for Kikuletwa River and mean annual rainfall over the tree decades. The results are also taken to indicate an inverse relationship between river level and temperature in the catchment suggesting the effects of climate change on water resources. The eight villages covered by this study face a variety of water shortage and environmental challenges that are intertwined with the causes and consequences of a changing climate.

eldis:A26526;Taking the bull by the horns: NGOs and pastoralists in coalition;;Such is the vagary of rainfall throughout Africa's rangelands that almost all pastoral communities face cycles of good and hardship years. During good years herders increase and diversify their herds, whilst consecutive hardship years or `pastoral drought,' human and livestock disease, or livestock theft may result in large livestock losses and the consequent temporary collapse of household food production. Seldom, however, do environmental factors alone conspire to overwhelm the pastoral production of entire ethnic groups, since pastoralists have `drought responses,' including mobile and adaptive grazing strategies, livestock and cereal exchanges, the establishment of diverse herds, herd splitting, and non-pastoral activities (agriculture, wage labour etc.).Underpinning these systems is often a network of affinal and `stock-friendships,' in which each herding family is involved in the reciprocal giving and receiving of livestock. In these ways, pastoral households are able to minimise the impact of crisis years, rebuild and maintain viable herds.The article recommends:the documentation and explanation of customary land-rights, in particular with regard to womenthe registration of pastoral land-rightsthe summarisation of national statutory laws affecting pastoral land-tenurethe exploration of ways of reconciling and integrating customary and statutory tenurethe provision of legal aid to fight test cases and the support of legal aid camps or clinics in pastoral areasthe incorporation of legal themes into adult education and literacy programmes for pastoralists ;A.

It provides unique and up-to-date insights on agriculture, water resources, governance, poverty, productivity, upstream–downstream linkages, innovations, future plans and their implications. Specifically, the book elaborates the history, and the major current and future challenges and opportunities, of the Nile River Basin. It analyses the basin characteristics using statistical data and modern tools such as remote sensing and geographic information systems. Population distribution, poverty and vulnerability linked to production systems and water access are assessed at the international basin scale, and the hydrology of the region is also analyzed.

eldis:A67835;Doubling irrigation for southern Africa – do we have enough water and where is the hope?;;"Southern Africa Development Communality (SADC) through its Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) has set up an ambitious goal to double irrigation by 2015, which it sees as important component to sustain regional development and ensure food security. While the target timeline is questionable with year 2015 fast approaching, the goal to increase irrigated areas to 7% is certainly valid and has significant implications for regional food security and livelihood of rural population.

The objective of this paper is to examine water resources in conjunction with the status of irrigation development in SADC region, and assess water availability for irrigation development. The desktop analysis builds largely upon literature, existing projects and products to integrate baseline information. The results reveal that water is sufficiently available for doubling irrigation without hampering too much on environment even with the possible impacts imposed by climate change. The potential is however largely variable from country to country, and basin to basin. To make irrigation sustainable and cost-benefit effective, irrigation expansion needs to undertake smart water resources/storages development to avoid significant impact on ecosystem functions which are all supported by water.

This follows the recognition that the climate is already changing as a result of mankind’s activities and there is little that can be done to prevent further increases in atmospheric concentrations of GHG in the short term.

It is clear that strategies for adaptation to climate change will need to embrace different sectors, support development and will be interdependent, requiring collaboration amongst multiple stakeholders, ranging from resource managers to policy makers. There is a need to be more proactive rather than reactive and to focus first on measures that achieve multiple goals, i.e., that address not only the impacts of climate change but also other stresses such as land degradation or desertification. In this brief review we highlight such measures that are being developed by the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) for the world’s non-tropical drylands.

eldis:A42106;Who’s oil? Sudan’s oil industry;;Oil is a principal factor in Sudanese politics. However, rather than contributing to an environment of peace and equitable development, it remains a source of strife and division.This dossier provides an overview of Sudan’s oil industry and serves as a background document about the country’s contentious oil issues. The tables with data in the first two chapters help the reader to get a picture of Sudan’s oil industry. The third chapter has a more analytical content and gives a better understanding of the consequences of oil extraction on the lives of the Sudanese citizens.The signing of Sudan’s Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/ Army (SPLM/A) in 2005, ended war in the South, but three years after signing, the CPA is in great danger. Its provisions have never been fully implemented. All points of contention on the implementation of the agreement relate to oil, including the North-South border demarcation, withdrawal of troops from the oil fields, oil revenue sharing and transparency, and the industry’s dramatic social and environmental record, which are undermining popular support for the peace agreement. The large economic growth over the last few years has made a small Northern elite very rich, but most Sudanese people have seen nothing of it.The political and security situation in the oil areas has remained tense as a result of the unsatisfactory implementation of CPA. Ordinary people see scarcely any peace or oil dividend. The former heavy-handed security arrangements are no longer in effect.The SPLM/A is gradually strengthening its hold over the oil regions, while exploration and development operations are extending southwards from the existing fields into areas without presence from the national army, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF). The document concludes that although at present there is no direct threat for clashes between the different forces, the oil fields remain a high risk area. Also, continued fighting in Darfur can threaten operations of oil companies in the Darfur-South Kordofan border area and spill over to the South. ;;;European Coalition on Oil in Sudan ;eldis;01/01/2008;en;extractive industries;;;"SDN;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A42106;http://www.ecosonline.org/back/pdf_reports/2008/dossier%20final%20groot%20web.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecosonline.org%2Fback%2Fpdf_reports%2F2008%2Fdossier%2520final%2520groot%2520web.pdf;;;;"Conflict and security;Peacebuilding;Sudan;Document Quick Add;environmental impact;Darfur;destruction and displacement;natural resources as driver of conflict;conflict resolution and reconciliation;oil industry;Drivers of conflict"
eldis:A12531;Caffeine and conservation;;Overproduction of coffee and low coffee prices have resulted in a global crisis affecting the people and biodiversity of many tropical countries. The authors, from the Wildlife Conservation Society in Indonesia, describe expanding production of low-quality robusta coffee, which contributes to low prices and lowland deforestation, but is not improving the livelihood of local farmers. They argue that further increased coffee production will increase deforestation in national parks and disproportionately affect Sumatran tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses.The authors argue for new certification guidelines, better protected area enforcement, improved agricultural practices, and a reduction in area planted in coffee as critical for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.[Adapted from authors] ;"T.

eldis:A67301;Assessing competitive resource tenders as an option for mining rights allocation in South Africa;;"The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment Bill of 2013 (MPRD-AB) has generated fresh debate regarding the appropriate system for allocating mineral prospecting and mining rights in South Africa. The draft bill no longer specifies that mining rights are to be allocated according to the first-in, first-assessed (FIFA) principle.

This paper aims to inform the current debate, focusing in particular on competitive resource allocation systems (also referred to as mineral rights auction or tender systems), which certain stakeholders have proposed as an alternative to the existing FIFA system. The focus on competitive resource allocation systems is also informed by Minister of Mineral Resources Susan Shabangu’s 2012 budget vote speech, in which she stated that the Department of Mineral Resources intended to begin a process of auctioning lapsed or revoked mining licences.

eldis:A29410;A review of changes in rangeland vegetation and livestock populations for Northern Kenya;;This  review explores environmental change in northern and south-central Kenya, roughly covering three decades from the 1960s to the 1990s. The report answers three questions:has vegetation change occurred in these districts?if vegetation change has occurred, why and how has this happened?what are the trends for livestock populations?The article concludes that:rangeland sites have been fundamentally altered by woody encroachment over the past 40 years. This has resulted from concentration of grazing pressure that has occurred due to declines in the mobility of pastoral people and their herds. Human population growth, insecurity, inadequate distribution of key resources, and the lure of markets and public services are all implicated in this patternlivestock populations have not changed in numbers or species composition, as is evident from aeriel survey datathe lack of livestock number/species trend detection may be complicated by the imprecision of aerial survey data, the possibility that major changes in livestock populations occurred before the period of aerial survey, and/or the presence of non-forage factors such as epidemic disease and livestock raiding that can exert marked influences on population dynamics ;"M.

eldis:A45457;Too many people, too few livestock: pastoralism in crisis?;;"
 


This thesis, is based on the follwing legs of argument, as follows:


    
    
    The pastoral human population is growing at about 2.5% per year
    
    
    
    
    A certain minimum number of livestock are needed to support these humans as pastoralists, even at very low levels of welfare. 
    
    
    
    
    The maximum total pastoral herd size is limited by the amount of livestock feed available. Where numbers temporarily exceed this limit they soon die back.
    
    
    
    
    In pastoral areas where Leg 4 of the argument is not yet the case, nevertheless widespread unbearable poverty already prevails because the total livestock herd is not equitably distributed between households. 
    
    
    
    
    The area of land accessible for pastoral use can not be significantly increased, e.g. by water development, and is in fact shrinking, as a result of the expansion of cultivation and of wildlife conservation areas. 
    
    
    
    
    There are no known technologies for significantly increasing primary range production, thereby permitting a larger aggregate herd size. 
    
    
    
    
    Overall herd productivity can not substantially improve unless the quantity and quality of feed is improved. 
    
    
    
    
    The patches of rain-fed cultivation which pepper the rangelands of GHA are, at present, technically, environmentally and economically inefficient. 
    
    
    
    
    The market prospects are not very favourable for increasing the unit value of pastoralists’ livestock 
    
    
    
    
    The prospects for other kinds of income diversification within the pastoral areas are unfavourable
    
    


The implications of this thesis are that a solution to the fundamental imbalance needs to be found in a combination of the following strategies: 


    
    
    The emigration of a substantial proportion of pastoralists from both substantial dependence on livestock and from pastoral areas. 
    
    
    
    
    The development, within or near pastoral areas, of more productive and more sustainable rain-fed or irrigated crop-agriculture into which previous pastoralists can switch their livelihoods; 
    
    
    
    
    The development of diversified income-earning opportunities not dependent on demand from within pastoral areas (e.g. in the production and gathering of “pharmaceutical” 3 products). 
    
    
    
    
    Reducing/reversing/ population growth. 
    
    
    
    
    A much greater (and more successful than hitherto) emphasis on improving range (the per hectare, primary, edible) productivity, thereby allowing more livestock to be kept, coupled with enhanced efforts to increase animal productivity. 
    
    
    
    
    A program to obtain higher prices for pastoralists’ livestock products by reform of the internal marketing system, and/or by “market development” (reaching new markets requiring higher quality and higher price products) or by a price stabilization scheme. 
    
    
    
    
     Additional (to the above) policy reforms (including land tenure) to facilitate the above.

eldis:A45454;World water and food to 2025: dealing with scarcity;;"The key messages of this presentation are:

    
    Increasing competition for water severely limits irrigation and constrains food production
    
    
    Slow progress in extending access to safe drinking water; water quality will decline; amount of water for environmental uses will be inadequate
    
    
    Moderate worsening in current water policies and investments could lead to full-blown water crisis
    
    
    Fundamental changes in water management and policy can produce a sustainable future for water and food
    

The presentation uses the Water Simulation Model to estimate effective water for irrigation and rain fed production based on climate parameters, infrastructure, and policy inputs. It suggests three approaches to the state of availability of water:

    
    Business as usual scenario; assumes continuation of existing trends:
    

Continued decline in crop research investments
Declining investment in irrigation expansion and reservoir storage
Limited institutional and management reform
Water use efficiency increases slowly
Slow growth in harvested area
Production increase mainly through yield growth
Low priority of rainfed agriculture
Expansion of groundwater pumping
No increase in environmental flows

    
    Water crisis scenario; assumes worsening of existing policies and trends:
    

Sharp reduction in investment in water storage, O&M
Degradation of irrigation infrastructure and management
Reduced water use efficiency
Lower investment in rainfed crop breeding and slower growth in rainfed crop yields
Increased erosion and sedimentation
Decline in net water storage due to reduced investment and sedimentation
Reduction in environmental flows
Low investment in water supply systems, decline in access to household water services. 

    Sustainable water use scenario; Assumes improvement of existing policies and trends and focus on environment:

Increase in investment in rainfed crop research and higher growth in rainfed yields
Medium growth in water storage; reduced sedimentation balances lower investment
Higher water use efficiency due to water management reform and higher agricultural water prices
More effective use of rainfall
Increased water prices and higher investment in water supply systems
Sharp increase in reserved environmental flows
Elimination of groundwater overdraft
 
The policy conclusions presented are as follows:

    Reform of water management policies, and investments to improve water efficiency
    Water price incentives and water trading
    Increasing crop productivity: water management, agricultural research and rural investment.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) has become a well-established developmental sector into which domestic water naturally falls. However, efforts to improve rural water supply services may benefit from more inter-disciplinary collaboration.

Given the vast numbers of rural people with inadequate drinking water supplies, the report argues that it may be time to build better synergies between WASH efforts and other work to reduce poverty, address power imbalances and improve environmental sustainability.

An improved understanding by water supply professionals and practitioners of the broader context of rural like, politics and the environment is highlighted as a good starting point. Likewise, for those working to improve rural livelihoods, address reduce poverty, and ensure environmental sustainability, a basic under-standing of rural water supplies is important.

eldis:A16932;TOTAL Oil: fuelling the oppression in Burma;;Coinciding with the launch of a new international campaign calling for TOTAL’s withdrawal from Burma, this report gathers together much of the available evidence relating to TOTAL’s role in fuelling the oppressive dictatorship in Burma. It explores human rights abuses associated with TOTAL’s gas pipeline, TOTAL’s financing of Burma’s dictatorship and TOTAL’s influence on French foreign policy and therefore on European Burma policy as a whole.The report finds that:one of the most significant consequence of TOTAL’s presence in Burma is its influence on French foreign policy: in order to protect TOTAL’s interests, the French government has become an obstacle to any strengthening of the EU’s Common Position on Burma, particular with regard to economic sanctionsTOTAL’s project provides significant annual revenue to the regime, which has helped the regime to build its military capacity and therefore its control of the country’s population, impeding the prospect of democratic changedespite being aware of the possible dangers, the TOTAL opted to employ, through MOGE (Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise), the services of the Burmese Army which is internationally renowned for its extreme and unrelenting brutalitythere are serious allegations that TOTAL’s money has been used by the regime to cover its money laundering activities through MOGE in order to purchase armsthe ‘constructive engagement’ that TOTAL claims to have been carrying out in Burma over the last decade has not resulted in a single democratic reform by the regime.The report highlights that TOTAL withdrawal from Burma would end the company’s support for the regime, deter future foreign investment in Burma and open the way to a French foreign policy that no longer undermines Burma’s pro-democracy movement. The report recommends that civil society organisations concerned with making corporations accountable for their actions join the international coalition on TOTAL. ;;;Burma Campaign, UK;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;"030;009;MMR";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16932;http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/PDFs/total%20report.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.burmacampaign.org.uk%2FPDFs%2Ftotal%2520report.pdf;;;;"Burma;Corporate Social Responsibility;dictatorship;Extractive industries oil;oil;Extractive industries;pipline"

eldis:A29869;State of the forest: Indonesia;;Joint report from Forest Watch Indonesia, World Resources Institute and  Global Forest Watch. It provides a detailed analysis of the scale and pace of change affecting Indonesia’s forests. The report concludes that the doubling of deforestation rates in Indonesia is largely the result of a corrupt political and economic system that regards natural resources as a source of revenue to be exploited for political ends and personal gain. The political  instability that followed the economic crises of 1997 and the eventual ousting of former President Suharto in 1998 further increased deforestation to its current level.The key findings of the report are as follows: Indonesia is experiencing one of the highest rates of tropical forest loss in the worldDeforestation in Indonesia is largely the result of a corrupt political and economic system that regarded natural resources, especially forests, as a source of revenue to be exploited for political ends and personal gainIllegal logging has reached epidemic proportions as a result of Indonesia's chronic structural imbalance between legal wood supply and demandMore than 20 million hectares of forest have been cleared since 1985, but the majority of this land has not been put to productive alternative usesThe Indonesian government is facing mounting pressure domestically and internationally to take action, but progress is slow and not all policy reforms in process are necessarily good news for forests [authors] Full document is available as a PDF (very large file) or Zipped PDF.

eldis:A25987;Forests and climate change: role of forest lands as carbon sinks;;Forests potentially contribute to global climate change through their influence on the global carbon (C) cycle. They store large quantities of C in vegetation and soil, exchange C with the        atmosphere through photosynthesis and respiration, are sources of atmospheric C when they are disturbed, become atmospheric C sinks during abandonment and regrowth after disturbance, and can be managed to alter their role in the C cycle. The world's forest contain about 830 Pg C (1015 g) in their vegetation and soil, with about 1.5 times as much in soil as in vegetation. During the 1980s, analysis of C budgets show that forest of the temperate and     boreal countries were a net sink of atmospheric C of about 0.7 Pg yr-1, but the tropics were a  net source of about 1.6 Pg yr-1. However, accounting for the imbalance in the global C cycle  suggests that forest are not significantly contributing to the net increase in atmospheric CO2 and  thus not contributing to global climate change. However, this may not continue into the future     as temperate and boreal forests reach maturity and become a smaller C sink, and if rates of  tropical deforestation and degradation continue to accelerate. Recent studies suggest that there is the potential to manage forests to conserve and sequester C to mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide by an amount equivalent to 11-15% of the fossil fuel emissions over the same time  period. Aggressive adoption of these forest management options are necessary to prevent forests becoming a significant net source of CO2 to the atmosphere in the future and contributing to climate change. ;S.

eldis:A59873;Using adaptation tipping points to prepare for climate change and sea level rise: a case study in the Netherlands;;"Studies on the impact of climate change and sea level rise usually rake climate scenarios as their starting point. To support long-term water management planning int he Netherlands, this paper starts at the opposite end of the effect chain. The study refers to three aspects of water management:

    flood defence
    drinking water supply
    protection of the Rotterdam harbour.

The authors examine whether, and for how long, current water management strategies will continue to be effective under different climate change scenarios. This was done by applying the concept of ‘adaptation tipping points’ – if the magnitude of change is such that the current management strategy can no longer meet its objectives. By applying this approach, the authors answer the following basic questions: what are the first issues that will be faced as a result of climate change and when can these be expected.

It presents the socioeconomic characteristics, historical drivers of change, resources use and management (water, land, forestry) and the institutional disincentives affecting agricultural production and productivity in the region. The paper also attempts to identify major drivers of change, and inventorize key institutions in the region and suggests improved institutional arrangements for improving agricultural productivity, resilience and ecosystem health at farm, landscape and basin scales.

eldis:A66736;Extractive industries, development and the role of donors;;"Extractive Industries (EI) explore, find, extract, process and market sub-soil assets – oil, gas and mined minerals. EI represent a large and growing activity in many less-developed countries. But natural resource wealth does not always lead to sustainable and inclusive growth. This guide sets out the recent rise in importance of EI to less-developed countries. It provides a framework for thinking about (i) the socio-economic impacts of these industries and (ii) the relationship between EI, host country public policies and donor activities.

The guide:


	provides an overview of recent trends in mineral commodity markets, the growing significance of EI to many less-developed countries, and what EI might mean for ‘aid graduation’
	sets out frameworks for thinking about how sub-soil assets are transformed into above-the-ground assets that can foster inclusive growth, the governance of those transformations, and the intersection of industry and public policy interests
	presents the industry perspective. It describes the activities across the project life cycle, whilst distinguishing between the mining and oil and gas sectors
	discusses EI from government’s perspective, highlighting the chain of policy decisions that need to be managed effectively to maximise developmental impacts of EI
	provides an overview of recent donor initiatives, suggestions for improving collaboration between donors and the private sector, and lessons learned

eldis:A31568;The Chad-Cameroon oil & pipeline project: a project non-compliance report;;"This report assesses the role of the World Bank in the funding and management of the Chad-Cameroon oil and pipeline project. The report argues that the project has fueled violence, impoverished people in the oil fields and along the pipeline route, exacerbated the pressures on indigenous peoples and created new environmental problems. The report highlights how the World Bank’s Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is inconsistent with other independent reports on the project. The ICR falsely claims that the compensation plan for Indigenous Peoples has been implemented in a timely manner and that that affected communities participate in economic development. Furthermore, one of the key promises of the project, enshrined in the Bank's loan and project agreements, was that all additional oil using the pipeline would be subject to the same environmental and social standards. The ICR now admits that enforcing this clause will be problematic. The report argues that the World Bank must address the outstanding environmental, livelihood and compensation problems. In particular, the Bank needs to address the concerns of Cameroon's indigenous Bakola/Bagyeli people, who have seen a worsening of their already precarious situation, and who face threats to their survival as a people. The report makes the following recommendations: 

    resolving problems of dust pollution, hazardous waste and general public health 
    ensuring adequate compensation and the restoration of livelihoods in the oil-producing region 
    scanning all regional compensation projects for defects, identifying solutions and resolving outstanding grievances
    ensuring active participation by indigenous peoples in the Indigenous Peoples Plan and ensuring their right of ownership to the land they traditionally occupy

Specifically, it examines the area around the Shwegyin and Mawtama Rivers where the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) and its business partners are engaged in building a dam, mining for gold, and logging the forests.The report highlights how heavy militarisation of the region, the indiscriminate granting of mining and logging concessions, and the construction of the Kyauk Naga Dam have led to forced labour, land confiscation, extortion, forced relocation, and the destruction of the natural environment. The human consequences of these practices have been social unrest, increased financial hardship, and great personal suffering for the victims of human rights abuses.The report makes numerous recommendations to the State Peace and Development Council on human rights, the environment, and mining which include:to make changes to the 1974 Constitution so that civilians have more rights over the land they occupy, including rights to obtain legal land titleto provide sufficient food, salaries, and other material supplies to its soldiers and officers so that they are self-sufficient in the field and do not need to live off the populationto replace outdated laws and replace ineffective environmental provisions to bring them into accordance with its 1994 Environmental Policy and the UN-supported national action plan for the environment known as “Myanmar Agenda 21”to strengthen the National Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA) by empowering it to enforce existing laws and other regulations regarding environmental issues to ban and take immediate legal action against individuals and companies using ecologically damaging techniques.The report also makes recommendations for international governments, international organisations and NGOs, the private sector and opposition groups. ;C.

Extractive activity, territory, and scial unrest in the Peruvian Amazon: the Cenepa river ;;"This case study shows how the activities of a large foreign-invested mining company on land held by the Awajun community in the northern forests of Peru have led to a characteristic cycle of state permissiveness in granting mining concessions, thus leading to social conflict.

It describes encounters between the company and the indigenous community who, though lacking land title, have protected their rights by demanding that their territory be declared a national park. It analyses Peru’s legal and institutional frameworks, and shows how successive governments have deemed the Amazon an ""empty"" territory to be exploited in order to bring ""progress"". It documents the emergence of this particular conflict, which has gradually escalated in severity, and argues that the temporary equilibrium that currently exists can only be sustained if all the actors involved recognise the common ownership of the lands in question.

eldis:A66088;Improving environmental management of extractives through Environmental Impact Assessments ;;"How have Latin American countries been using Environmental Impact Assessments in order to build more sustainable extractive industries? A focus on Peru provides some interesting lessons.

Is it possible to develop extractive industries while preserving the environment? Several Latin American countries have been attempting to improve the environmental sustainability of their extractive industry sectors by developing their legal frameworks, in particular through the use and adaptation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) tool.

This Brief focuses primarily on experiences in Peru, where integration of the EIA into extractive industry policy has been extensive.  The Brief focuses on three particularly noteworthy innovations implemented in Peru: mine closure plans; regulation and approval mechanisms; and citizen participation.  Overall, the Brief aims to offer an understanding of the advances, challenges and debates around the implementation of EIAs when seeking a balance between environmental sustainability and extractive sector development. The lessons drawn from Peru and other Latin American countries may be useful for other regions struggling to balance extractive industry development with environmentally sustainable approaches to land use.

Key Lessons:


	incorporating the EIA into environmental management policies can help countries to build more sustainable extractive industry sectors
	closure plans represent one mechanism being used to strengthen environmental management by committing private investors to mitigate the long-term environmental impacts that typically undermined the sustainability of extractive projects
	EIA processes should be closely regulated by the state, but independently evaluated in order to improve transparency and legitimacy

Specifically, the paper attempts to understand whether there is a causal relationship from natural resource abundance to corruption. The paper analyses the case of São Tomé and Príncipe. The paper looks at the effects of the announcements of a significant oil discovery in the period 1997-1999 and whether that translates into increased corruption efforts.The study conducted household surveys on perceived corruption in the public services/sector. The paper finds that an increase in perceived corruption has occurred in São Tomé and Príncipe in recent years, ranging from 21% to 38% of the subjective scale. Specifically, clear changes in several sectors where public rents are perceived to increase corruption. The most robust sectors include: vote buying, education, and state jobs. ;P.

However, this can lead to trade-offs with other sustainability objectives. This policy brief outlines key issues relating to biodiversity and the development of the hydropower sector in Vietnam. It is aimed at informing policymakers, civil society and donors. It argues that the large-scale development of the country’s hydropower sector is being undertaken without due consideration of the impacts that this is having on the nation’s biodiversity. Environmental services from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are crucial to the livelihoods of many of the country’s poorer communities; sustainable development requires that environmental assets are properly valued and accounted for. The brief concludes by asserting that policymakers must undertake proper environmental assessments in order to arrive at a strategically planned energy mix that is sustainable in the long-term.

eldis:A63801;Governing the forests: an institutional analysis of REDD+ and community forest management in Asia;;"This report examines the history, structure and monitoring mechanisms of REDD+ to better understand how it impacts upon, and interacts with, Community Forest Management (CFM). It presents case studies of CFM and REDD+ governance from Bangladesh, Indonesia and India, and concludes with some lessons learned.REDD+ is an example of multilevel governance that uses a variety of institutional structures and processes aimed at promoting sustainable management of forests, including financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. At the national level, countries have their own systems of governance, often jointly managed by multiple interests, including CFM. Having given an overview of REDD+ itself, the paper explores how REDD+ influences and reacts to local circumstances.The case studies feature different aspects of CFM and REDD+ governance. The paper highlights the emerging role of CFM in reducing carbon emissions in Bangladesh, presents lessons from the implementation of a public/private partnership in Indonesia and explores indigenous carbon management practices in India.Conclusions drawn from the case studies on challenges and implications for REDD+ governance include the following.

    The role of forest stocks in international regimes requires clarification; forest stocks must be managed in ways that incentivise communities and governments to avoid deforestation and degradation, whilst remaining sensitive to the needs of forest-dependent communities.
    Local government capacity must be sufficiently strengthened so as to provide support in connecting local and global governance. 
    There is a need to link carbon management with local practices and economic activities; community forums should be established to allow all stakeholders to collaborate and explore strategies that harness local opportunities for income diversification.
    Issues of land tenure and carbon rights must be clarified and strengthened to provide lasting security to forest-dependent communities.
    Monitoring, reporting and verifying the participation of all stakeholders requires greater effort and resources.
    Protocols are required for resolving ecological problems and dispute settlements; interaction should be more informal and decisions made by consensus rather than majority rule.

eldis:A70829;The status of agricultural water use, access, and productivity in the Limpopo Basin — opportunities for poverty alleviation ;;"The Limpopo River Basin is home to 14,000,000 people, at least half of whom live in rural areas. Over ten million South Africans live in the basin - nearly 25% of the national population. The remaining population live in Botswana - one million people, nearly 60% of the national population - Mozambique and Zimbabwe. While there are no major cities located on the river, several major urban areas in or adjacent to the basin impact water availability including quality.

Rainfall over much of the Limpopo is highly variable within and between years, so that farmers who rely on rain fed agriculture are vulnerable. Those with resources to invest in storage and water-saving technology are better able to withstand the chronic weather-related shocks. Yet few small-scale, resource-poor farmers have the resources to make the necessary investments, which many see as a risky venture.

The policy environment for management of natural resources in the four Basin countries has developed over the last 15 years, but further attention is needed in the following areas:


	strengthen Limpopo River Basin Commission (LIMCOM’s) capacity to plan and monitor water use and quality
	develop a secure framework of land tenure and water rights for rural populations to encourage investment and sustainability
	price and prioritise the use of water by small-holders to ensure their economic viability; and
	plan for water resources development with an eye toward the variation from the historical record of current and future precipitation scenarios

eldis:A20246;Diamonds, foreign aid, and the uncertain prospects for post-conflict reconstruction in Sierra Leone;;This article examines the external and internal dimensions and resources of post-conflict reconstruction in Sierra Leone. Foreign aid represents the bulk of the external sources of support, though its imminent reduction is a significant concern. Internally resources, such as diamond exports, offer much potential as a means to spur economic growth and reconstruction, but diamonds may also very well disrupt reconstruction efforts.The paper finds that:while foreign donors have been financing many reconstruction projects it is uncertain what level of international aid will be received by Sierra Leone in the medium and long terminternal sources of reconstruction are equally uncertain: while diamond exports have been growing at a healthy rate since the final years of the civil war, particularly since the official end of hostilities at the beginning of 2002, a number of obstacles remain:diamond smuggling and illicit mining persist in Sierra Leone, despite the strengthening of legislationregional instability may place the diamond mines at risk once again should hostilities resume in Liberia or emerge in Guineait is risky to rely on a single commodity for the bulk of export earnings, especially as diamond resources themselves are finitethe present challenge is to focus on more medium- and long-term reconstruction solutions, entailing more conventional forms of developmentthe psychological and physical trauma endured by the people of Sierra Leone cannot be ignored by efforts to spur economic growth and reconstruction as this is crucial to prevent a resumption of the vicious cycle of greed and grievance that led to the outbreak of civil war in the first place. ;J.

eldis:A76338;Avoiding the resource curse in Lebanon;;"The discovery and extraction of oil and gas off the shores of Lebanon could ultimately translate into a boom in revenues for the government, which in light of current poor fiscal planning could lead to an uncontrolled expansionary budget policy and eventually a ‘resource curse’. If these revenues are spent with no oversight and proper planning, the country m ay well collect and allocate large streams of cash that make limited contributions to economic development. But the ‘resource curse’ could be avoided if appropriate policy adjustments are implemented in conjunction with the development of offshore hydrocarbon resources.
The successful experiences of a few resource-rich countries like Norway have been largely attributed to properly managing resource wealth and its associated risks. The optimal response that takes advantage of the boom while mitigating its potential negative implications includes a set of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and structural reform policies.
As Lebanon stands poised to establish its oil and gas sector and possibly profit from new resource wealth, it has become increasingly critical for this small economy to implement public policies that take advantage of the oil boom while mitigating its potential negative implications. This typically includes a set of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and structural reform policies which are required to avoid the resource curse.
Indeed, the government must resist pressures to enjoy all the windfall revenues in the short run and recklessly expand its budget expenditure. On the contrary, it must commit to saving part of the revenue proceeds every period in order to attain a permanent wealth increase. Ideally, the government must direct its spending toward the non-resource tradables sector through subsidizing outputs and/or inputs or investing in physical and human capital to enhance productivity in these sectors. In this case, a budget expansion would not necessarily lead to shrinkage of the productive sectors. It is clear, however, that proper public financial management is central to the above macroeconomic policy framework. Key to the above analysis and recommendations is the political economy and institutional setup, especially the role and proper functioning of fiscal institutions. Increasing accountability and transparency in public institutions is essential, and this ultimately requires political reforms that increase the commitment and engagement of citizens in the actions of their government, through proper electoral representation.

eldis:A8753;Common property: can customary law adapt to the free market?;;Transition from subsistence to market economy is not easy. In Papua New Guinea most land is still held under traditional systems of common property resource ownership and a growing cash economy can spark conflict concerning management or ownership issues. Research presented at the annual meeting of the UK Development Studies Association (DSA) examines the institutional limitations, during transition, of traditional ownership systems. Data from Morobe villages suggest that subsistence-based common property regimes may lack the institutional capacity to regulate the economic opportunism of individuals and to achieve a measure of collective sustainable development. ;John Rivers;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"common property;property;customary law;land tenure";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";150;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A8753;http://www.id21.org/society/1ajr1.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fsociety%2F1ajr1.html;;;;"Agriculture and food;social capital;customary law;subsistence;transition;Communal land;markets;sustainability;Rural Papua New Guinea;fishing;common property rights;Land tenure;rural;common property;inter-generational transfer;resources"
eldis:A14282;Sudan, oil, and human rights;;This report examines the human cost of oil, and corporate complicity in the Sudanese government’s human rights abuses. It finds that oil is an important obstacle to lasting peace in Sudan, and oil revenues have been used by the government to obtain weapons and ammunition that have enabled it to intensify the war and expand oil development. The large-scale exploitation of oil by foreign companies operating in the theatre of war in southern Sudan has increased human rights abuses there and has exacerbated the long-running conflict in Sudan.The report outlines the history of the oil sector in Sudan, summarising the experiences of a number of oil companies, and evidence of large-scale displacement of southern Sudanese as a result of the oil operations, and the intensification of civil war. It also provides a detailed account of the human rights consequences of oil development in Sudan, including population displacement, ethnic manipulation, aerial bombings of civilians, property destruction, waste, and, especially for many Nuer and Dinka, human misery and despair.The report finds that oil company representatives were aware of human rights abuses, and were complicit with the government, and its preference for business as usual over policies aimed at ending abuses.  It concludes that the companies investigated are inappropriately operating in Sudan and should suspend their operations unless and until a set of minimum benchmarks are met, including:Displacement:companies: should adequately finance a team, under the supervision of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, to compile an authoritative, credible survey of the identities and numbers of civilians forcibly displaced in or from the relevant oil concessions. Its findings should be made public, and should be in a form usable for determining future compensationthe government: should provide temporary accommodation for those who have been displaced in accordance with the standards utilized by the UNHCR. It should implement a credible and verifiable process to allow those forcibly displaced to return to their homes, with adequate compensation. If return is not possible, it provides them with adequate compensation for an acceptable place of relocation. Compensation should include not only relocation funds, but also compensation for the loss of livelihood, family members, and property, and pain and suffering as a result of government army or militia attack and subsequent displacement. It should permit unimpeded access to the oil-producing areas for Sudanese citizens, international organizations, human rights monitors, journalists, and humanitarian organizationsTransparency:oil companies, consortia members, and subcontractors should disclose whether they have provided cash or in kind equipment or services for military, security, or dual use purposesthe government should adhere in full to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Code of Good Practices for Fiscal Transparency. It should publish the audits that the IMF Auditor General has conducted of Sudapet oil revenue and Sudanese government revenue from 1999 through 2002, and of the year 2003, and future such auditsIn addition, the report lists further recommendations to companies, the government of Sudan, the United States, the Canadian government, the European Union, China and Malaysia, the UN Security Council, the World Bank and the Sudanese rebel forces. ;;;Human Rights Watch ;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"extractive industries;displacement";Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;"SDN;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A14282;http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/sudan1103/;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrw.org%2Freports%2F2003%2Fsudan1103%2F;;;;"human rights abuse;SPLA;Pastoralism;corporate social responsibility;Conflict and security;Stakeholders in conflict;Governance;Agriculture and food;oil;climate change as driver of conflict;extractive industries;Corporate Social Responsibility;Security;Dinka;Drivers of conflict;Nuer;CSR;Human rights;resource conflict;Business;Extractive industries oil;New wars;SPLM;Displacement;civil war;Globalisation;company complicity;Business and corruption;complex emergencies;Business and human rights;Extractive industries;Southern Sudan;oil curse feature;Good governance human rights;conflict"
eldis:A21833;A solution to desertification: holistic resource management;;It is clear from the failure of our efforts in many countries to halt the desertification process - deserts are now advancing at a rate of nearly 15,000,000 acres a year worldwide (Worrall 1984) (that something was missing in our knowledge of the problem). Four discoveries have been made that enabled us to design a simple holistic model to manage resources successfully in a sustained and economic manner. Excellent results have now been achieved in many situations, and we have witnessed positive grassland improvement, even in a severe drought and under increased livestock stocking rates while protected plots in the same seasons have deteriorated (Cardon 1983, Savory 1984).HRM offers great hope for all resource management situations. The Center for Holistic Resource Management, a nonprofit membership organisation located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was formed by a group of resource managers, researchers, ranchers, farmers and environmentalists, to provide training and dissemination of knowledge on HRM. Working in an international collaborative effort, the Center now also acts as a focal point for the rapid increase in knowledge that is taking place through practical application of the HRM Model. ;A.

eldis:A15150;The water issue between Singapore and Malaysia: no solution in sight?;;"Singapore has been dependent on Malaysia for nearly forty percent of its water supply, and water has been a source of dispute between the two countries.  This paper examines the water issues between Singapore and Malaysia.The paper describes the water agreements signed in 1961 and 1962.  It discusses some of the important aspects of the dispute between Singapore and Malaysia, including the debate on pricing, the right to revise prices, and the guarantee of supplies after 2061.  It analyses the economics of water, in particular, the water demand and supply situation in Singapore in 1960-2000.  The paper also examines the contention that the Malaysian state of Johor is making losses by selling raw water to Singapore and buying treated water from Singapore.Finally, the paper explores the potential for alternative sources of water supply, such as through desalination and recycled water.The paper finds that:Singapore is seeking to diversify its water supplies to include supplies from IndonesiaNewater (recycled water) can be produced in sufficient quantities to replace water that Singapore is currently purchasing from Malaysiabased on an analysis of costs and prices, it does not seem that Johor has been losing money by buying treated water from SingaporeSingapore has weaned itself from a condition of extreme water dependency to one of near self-sufficiency.  However, self-sufficiency would only occur by 2011.Overall, the paper concludes that the ""water threat"" is less than what it seems to be.The paper recommends that Singapore should source its water requirements domestically if the price of raw water in Malaysia is increased beyond a certain level. At the same time, the paper suggests that the Singapore government should consider the social and economic impacts of sourcing of water by desalination and recycling (NeWater).However, even if it becomes self-sufficient, the paper notes that the Singapore government has said that it would continue to purchase water, under fair terms, from Malaysia or any other country willing to be its long term supplier.  If Singapore continues to source for water elsewhere, the paper recommends that there should be a framework to facilitate the purchase and supply of water between countries in the region.In terms of the current water disputes between Malaysia and Singapore, the paper suggests that an appropriate negotiation mechanism is required to resolve the current deadlock, and find an equitable pricing structure that maximizes monetary benefits for both countries.

eldis:A22427;Developing local capacity for management of natural resource conflicts in Africa: a review of key issues, approaches, and outcomes;;"This research paper critically evaluates the key issues and approaches in community-based natural resource conflict management.  This assessment is done in light of USAID’s recent framework ""Nature, Wealth, and Power"" (NWP). The purpose of the framework is to provide a clearer understanding of challenges and options regarding natural resource conflicts and attempts to manage or resolve them.  Land and natural resources are vital to livelihoods and identities of people in Africa.  Therefore conflicts over their access and use necessitate special attention from those concerned with its development.This paper begins with an evaluation of the NWP framework.  It analyses some of its assumptions about conflict management and the broader agenda of African development. The author argues that the framework offers a positive programme for action but can be strengthened by contextualising more clearly the conditions and trends it tries to address. For instance, what are the sources of the issues and problems associated with nature/resources, wealth/economics, and power/governance highlighted in NWP? What contributes to their perpetuation? Such information is vital for proper planning, including overcoming obstacles and pitfalls arising from inaccurate or incorrect assumptions.The next two sections of this research paper examine the social and historical dimensions of African land and natural resource conflicts. The analysis identifies the intractable nature of many of these conflicts, which originate in inequalities embedded in the national policy frameworks set up for administering land during the colonial era. It also describes efforts in recent decades by independent African governments to reform their national policies through a range of interventions, including many recent participatory endeavors. At the same time, the paper reveals how political, economic, demographic, and other socioeconomic factors are altering people’s relationship to land and to each other, triggering more conflicts.The paper concludes with by examining current practices in natural resource conflict management. The author explores some current patterns, especially how people make use of a range of legal orders and of conflict management processes in trying to resolve conflicts. The study also looks at strengths and weaknesses of three major modes of conflict management processes: Alternative Dispute Resolution, which is popular with international donors; national legal systems; and informal conflict management, which the NWP framework identifies as highly significant.The author draws the following conclusion from his research:a multifaceted approach to conflict resolution is vital in the African contextit is crucial in conflict resolution to pay attention to issues of democratisation, national policy and legislative reform, and agrarian change, particularly the socioeconomic and demographic processes fostering intensified competition for land and resourcesinvolve a range of conflict management processes, including national legal systems, alternative dispute resolution, and informal conflict management practices, while paying close attention to each process’s strengths and weaknessescareful attention should be given particularly to issues regarding accessibility and participation by women, the poor, and other socially subordinate groupsgiven the popularity of Alternative Dispute Resolution among international donors, evaluations need to be done to determine its effectiveness and impacts.

eldis:A38622;Coping with riverbank erosion induced displacement;;"Each year, tens of thousands of people in Bangladesh are internally displaced as a consequence of riverbank erosion. Yet, such erosion does not draw the attention of policy makers in the same way that other natural disasters do and as a result, a number of coping mechanisms are employed by those affected, with the burden of displacement largely falling on women. This brief argues that instead of attempting to alter the course of nature, it is time to address the institutional mechanisms needed to help affected people cope with displacement and their material and social loss. Policy and programme recommendations include: 

    the government of Bangladesh should include riverbank erosion in its five year plan and in its framing of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
    it should also develop a national habitat policy that would ensure the shelter needs of the tens of thousands of people displaced each year 
    local government organisations should play the lead role in all phases – decentralisation of power and increased responsibility and accountability to local government bodies is an important aspect to reduce vulnerability and provide a quicker and more efficient response 
    efforts should be made to coordinate all aid and development interventions 

It is asserted that programmes should be developed to cater to the needs of those affected. In addition, increased emphasis should also be placed on promoting a rights-based approach which encourages affected people to demand access to education, health care, water, sanitation and work opportunities as a matter of right, rather than charity from the state. A number of recommendations are given to this end. The authors argue that, crucially, those affected need to be viewed as agents rather than simply subjects of rehabilitation programmes, asserting that only by constant promotion of their rights can their interests be protected.

eldis:A9358;Protecting forests for water management;;Forests play an important role in the water cycle, stimulating rainfall, protecting soils from erosion and regulating the flow of water. It is therefore important to preserve forests for water management. Previous efforts to protect forests in Ecuador have relied on controlling land use and excluding local people. These methods often have limited success, because of problems such as corruption and a lack of enforcement. A new approach is to pay people to protect the forests. People who benefit from the services the forest provide - such as clean water - make payments to those who look after the forests. ;"Marta Echavarria

eldis:A13872;Poverty and environmental degradation in the drylands: an overview of problems;;This paper seeks to analyse some of the problems of degradation persisting in the dryland regions with particular reference to Sub-Saharan Africa, and describe the processes that aim to tackle them.It identifies the threat to dryland regions as a complex mixture of degrading soils, continuous exposures to frequent droughts and political and economic marginalisation which is putting poor people living in the drylands at risk. To understand the complexities of the current problems the authors critically review the historical debates and ecological concepts, surrounding the ideas of desertification and degradation and the assumptions on which they rest. Similarly explanations regarding the relationships between population, poverty, and environmental degradation are explored and different approaches towards tackling the problems in the drylands are discussed, with specific attention to the case of pastoralism.The paper then turns to describing and discussing the efforts of the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to implement policies and practices conducive to preventing degradation in the drylands. The authors position is that the UNCCD needs to review its primary aims to determine whether it is an environmental convention, or a convention aimed at developing the drylands. They argue strongly for the latter option putting forward the view that lack of international financial support is hampering progress and that the implementation of the CCD will be a difficult task unless the goals of  development and poverty reduction in the drylands are endorsed as the cornerstones of the convention reflecting the priorities of the big donors.Some specific suggestions as to further contribitutions which Norway can make are also put forward. ;"S.

eldis:A70760;Flash flood risk management: a training of trainers manual ;;"Unstable geological conditions and steep topography, combined with frequent extreme weather conditions, make the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region prone to many natural hazards. Among these, flash floods – severe flood events that occur with little warning – are particularly challenging for communities, threatening lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure. Vulnerable groups such as the poor, women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities are often the hardest hit. This Training of Trainers Manual is designed to help build the capacity of trainers in flash flood risk management, who can then disseminate the knowledge to a larger number of practitioners. The manual presents an eight-day course including a three-day field trip. Detailed lesson plans for 21 sessions are followed by resource materials that will enable the trainers to replicate the course in their own work areas. Designed for participants with a basic knowledge of flash flood risk assessment and management, the manual focuses on developing understanding of the types, causes, and impacts of flash floods; flash flood hazards, vulnerability, risk assessment, and management methods; the role of local knowledge and gender perspectives in flash flood risk management; participatory social hazard mapping techniques; concepts and methods for an integrated approach to flash flood risk management; the full range of risk management measures for specific types of flash floods; legal and institutional aspects; and modelling tools. It is hoped that the publication will contribute meaningfully towards reducing disaster risk and providing greater physical security for the people of this vulnerable region.

eldis:A18046;Models for recognising indigenous land rights in Latin America;;"This paper discusses issues surrounding indigenous land rights, sharing an understanding and information about land tenure and titling within Latin America.  The study focuses on examples from the country level, with the aim of influencing policy coherence and legislation.In particular, Chapter four of this document examines the implications of indigenous land tenure for natural resource management, using case studies from Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama and Peru.  It explores how the differing bodies of law in each country contribute to or undermine the ability of indigenous people to manage their natural resources.The paper draws out the following conclusions:land is not only a physical asset with some economic and financial value, but an intrinsic dimension and part of peoples lives and belief systemsthe legal situation of indigenous land rights in the countries of Latin America is highly variedthere is no single pattern of legal rights that guarantees a successful outcome on the ground for indigenous land tenure; rather, different combinations of rights can yield strong or weak results, depending on the context and the extent of political willlegal systems strongly support indigenous land rights when they take into account not only land ownership itself, but also the security of that ownership and whether it is conceptualized within the framework of the concept of an indigenous territoryland rights are stronger when the legal system concurrently recognises other rights over natural resources on indigenous lands and the rights of indigenous peoples to manage their own affairsrecognising the land rights of indigenous peoples is not a simple question of granting title, but involves addressing a more complex set of interrelated legal, social, and political issues in order to be effective and secure.[adapted from author] ";R.

eldis:A18639;Indigenous rangeland resources and conflict management by the North Afar pastoral groups in Ethiopia;;"This case study, conducted in north Afar pastoral settlements in Ethiopia, explores pastoral natural resource management as well as indigenous conflict management.Main findings of the study include:the pattern of natural resource management has shown dramatic changes in 4-5 decades time, eroding traditional strategies of pastoral resource management; and this is caused mainly by the encroachment of cultivation and human population pressuregrazing reserves once used to sustain pastoral livelihood during drought periods are no longer widely used by community. Customary laws that were effective means of ensuring sound use of grazing reserves are weakened by the creation of incompatible administration system and recurrent droughttransformation in government support of pastoral natural resource management is an essential component of sound pastoral natural resource management and this needs to devolve decision-making responsibility to grassroots indigenous institutionsintra-community conflicts of the Afar heightened with a change in land use system from nomadic pastoralism to settled agriculture. These conflicts, however, have been declining, which is mainly due to the increased economic interdependence and crosscutting ties as well as the growing power balance between the two communities the Afar have local assemblies through which inter-clan conflicts are sorted out and thoroughly addressed. Together with highland communities, they have also acquired a long-standing tradition of settling inter-community disputes through a joint institution these traditional dispute settlement mechanisms have symbiotic relations with modern governmental administrative and legal machinerya merger and further integration of the traditional and the modern systems is recommendedNGOs and development agents can also play a pivotal role by creating a conducive environment for inter-community socio-economic integration through community based development interventions.

eldis:A18635;Water resources as a source of conflicts in Central Asia;;"This paper analyses the problem of water resource sharing in Central Asia. The authors consider this problem to be especially important, since they believe that the struggle for control over water resources will be one of the main causes of internal and international conflicts in the 21st century.[The full text of this paper is in Russian language only.]The authors note that in each of the Central Asian republics, the amount of water consumption rises, while the amount of water reserves decreases. The reasons for this are believed to be as follows:very large scale cotton agriculture in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan established in the Soviet periodlittle attention paid to the renewal of water resources (which led to the near disappearance of the Aral sea)massive and inefficient irrigationAccording to the authors, the distribution of water resources in the region is characterized as follows:Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are the countries with the greatest per capita water reservesTajikistan has the greatest number of lakes in the Amudarya basina large number of rivers originate in mountains on Tajikistan’s territory, then flow into neighboring statesboth Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have a very large potential for the development of hydroelectric power production, but are dependent on natural gas supplied by neighboring UzbekistanThe paper identifies the following regional tensions over the use of water resources:the greatest level of tensions was caused by the increase in Uzbekistan's gas export prices that led to greater energy consumption in Kyrgyzstan, an increase in the production of electricity at the Toktogul power plant, and a smaller volume of the Naryn river reaching Uzbekistanthe desire of Uzbekistan to become the regional center of political power led it to pressure Tajikistan, increasing the price of gas exported to Tajikistan; the latter country retaliated with a number of canal projects that cut Uzbekistan’s water supply certain tensions also exist between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on usage of the Amudarya riverThe authors conclude that the prevention of conflicts requires a common policy effort by all Central Asian states.

eldis:A35480;Monitoring land cover dynamics in sub-saharan Africa;;"Over the last 25 years civil disturbances, drought, population increases and global market pressures have all contributed in direct and indirect ways to a modification of Sub saharan African land cover.  
This study uses satellite data to assess the land cover change that has taken place between 1975 and 2000 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study shows that Africa has lost 16% of its forests and 5% of its woodlands and grasslands over the 1975 to 2000 period, equating to over 50,000 square km per year of natural vegetation. The majority of this has been converted to agricultural lands. Main findings include: 

    the agricultural domain is more crowded than 25 years ago – the on-going dynamic can lead to environmental refugees and conflict 
    the role of protected areas is even more crucial than ever – but they are becoming more isolated and vulnerable 
    climate change scenarios point to a worsening situation. 

Main recommendations for development include: 

    a priority of rural development policy should be oriented to increase yields through an intensification of agriculture and integration with animal husbandry 
    activities related to the adaptation to climate change should be concentrated in the most sensitive areas 
     development policy needs to address the drivers of conflict – amongst which available land and access to natural resources figure strongly 
     to ensure that environmental sustainability can be achieved, ‘environmental and natural resource’ issues must be fully integrated into development policies and processes.

eldis:A45794;Men first: inheritance rights and women in rural China;;"For women in rural China, inheritance rights are often limited by traditional customs which give greater benefits to men. Although this is being challenged by new laws that recognise women’s legal rights, increased access for women to jobs and education, there is a big gap between legislation and reality.Research from
University College Chester analyses the transfer of resources between
generations within households and village communities in rural China, with
particular reference to Dongdatun, a village in the
north. Women’s access to family resources is limited by patriarchal inheritance
systems, which favour male family members. 
In Dongdatun,
as in many villages, recent years have seen a marked diversification of rural
livelihoods, a rapid growth of rural industry and a diversification of
ownership structures. However, changing economic conditions caused by the ending
of rural communes has reduced rural people’s security. In the absence of state
or collectively financed social security, needs that are met by social welfare
services in China’s cities are still perceived as the responsibility of
individuals in rural areas.
In rural
societies, the focus of women’s lives is their husbands’ families, due to the
persistence of ‘patrilocal marriage’, in which a
woman moves into her husband’s village at marriage. Daughters leave their natal
(birth) families, but sons stay put. This means rural people continue to rely
on sons for security and support in ill health or retirement.
Evidence from
interviews with village women showed that:

Most women do not have the
same inheritance rights as their brothers nor do they try to claim them.
Many women still believe
that a ‘virtuous woman’ should not assert her own interests in the home
and should avoid household disputes through tolerance and unselfishness. 
Traditional beliefs are so
strongly held that many women also have negative attitudes towards
daughters’ inheritance rights. 

This
situation appears to be changing, however. Improved opportunities for women to
have paid jobs, education and training have increased their confidence and
bargaining power in the transfer and redistribution of resources within the
household. Young village women defend the legitimacy of ‘uxorilocal’
marriage, in which the husband lives with his wife’s family. More married
daughters now stay on in their natal households. The question of rural women’s
inheritance rights – particularly married women’s’ inheritance to parental estates
and remarried widows’ inheritance rights in their previous married families –
is now discussed more openly.
A lack of
similar legal mechanisms for old-age security, combined with the persistence of
patrilocal marriage, has reinforced the tradition of passing resources onto
sons, the denial of daughters’ inheritance rights and the need for families to
provide security for the elderly. However, the traditional security of extended
and close family structures is now under threat from rural industrialisation,
population mobility and family planning laws.
To protect
older people and encourage stronger rights for women, the Chinese authorities
should:

accept that the lack of a
basic system of social security has reinforced constraints on women’s
rights to inherit, their power in the family and society, as well as their
citizenship rights
recognise that the state has
an active role to play in extending rural social security programmes - to
promote welfare for all, especially women
challenge patriarchal practices in order to
realise equal inheritance rights for men and women in rural China.

The unfairness of the differences between traditional
rights of men and women will only change with effective social policies that
combat gender discrimination and exclusion.

eldis:A70503;Win win partnership? China, Southern Africa and extractive industries;;"The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has prioritised Africa as a strategic partner at both the political and economic levels. According to some observers, the evidence of China’s growing African involvement suggests a strategy devised to secure access to the continent’s abundant resources.

Through a combination of soft power, tactical incentives, strategic investment and political collaboration. Observers declare Chinese interventions particularly troubling where they appear to (inadvertently or by design) support authoritarian regimes, hinder economic development, promote conflict and allow human rights abuses.

Africa’s dynamic relationship with China offers many new possibilities and potential advantages, but the form and content of this relationship should be shaped by Africans.

However, appropriate and effective policy responses (from both China and Africa) are required to ensure a mutually beneficial China-Africa relationship, particularly in relation to the most critical sector – natural resources. This study investigates the China-Africa relationship in relation to the extraction of natural resources across southern Africa and suggests policy options and dialogue processes that would help to create a more positive relationship and support mutual economic development.

In this context, policy options and dialogue processes become critical in advancing the interests of southern Africa’s economic development, human security and democratisation in the face of new challenges. The process of ensuring a win-win relationship with China should include the following:


	building and maintaining an efficient and effective mining public administration;
	developing the competencies to run the extractive industries;
	strengthening tax regimes;
	building linkages between the extractive industries and local economies;
	using China’s massive finances to support regional infrastructure development; and
	ensuring that Chinese companies are no longer let off the hook regarding corporate social responsibilities.


Ineffective governance and commercial regulation will inevitably allow for a poor result from any foreign involvement option. Southern African nations need to be more steadfast in pursuing their national interests and achieving their long-term goals. ";"G. Shelton

eldis:A70466;Mainstreaming anti-corruption initiatives: development of a water sector strategy in Mozambique;;"Sector approaches to combating corruption have gained momentum in recent years, yet the strategic prioritization of sector anti-corruption initiatives is still the exception. The National Water Directorate in Mozambique is one of the few public sector departments in the world known to have allocated its own resources to developing a sector-specific anti-corruption strategy. Its experience offers valuable lessons for others considering integrating anti-corruption in sectors. Leadership needs to come from ministries with intersectoral mandates or through formal collaboration between different ministries. Government-led processes must be complemented by locally driven social accountability processes. Sector strategies need strong political commitment, at sector and central government levels, since multi-stakeholder processes are complex and time-consuming, and the implementation of sector strategies must include sector-level human resources and management systems.

eldis:A35441;Local communities and natural products: a manual for organising natural resource management groups for resource management planning, enterprise development and integration into value chains;;"Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is key to ensuring that local communities' livelihoods needs are met through the sustainable management of natural resources. Policies promoting CBNRM mean that government agencies, non-governmental organisations and other service providers are increasingly becoming involved in supporting these communities to form natural resource management (NRM) groups to make progress in areas of resource governance and realise its economic benefits through natural resource based enterprise.
This manual intends to serve the needs of agencies and organisations that are interested in facilitating such community organising, NRM planning and implementation, community-based natural product enterprise development, and the integration of NRM groups or natural products enterprises into rewarding value chains. It has evolved out of the experiences of implementation of a diverse range of CBNRM projects in Nepal. It outlines five distinct phases from identifying and organising the community to integrating community enterprises into value chain. These five phases comprise the five core chapters of this manual and cover: 

    Phase 1: identifying and organising community for natural resource management and enterprises giving the example of how community forest user groups in Nepal identify, secure and manage community forest areas
    Phase 2: developing and implementing participatory natural resource management plan by  assessing resources by conducting a resource inventory and developing an operational management plan
    Phase 3: implementing the approved natural resource management plan and ensuring forest products are harvested at a sustainable level
    Phase 4: developing and implementing community-based natural products enterprise plan by conducting a feasibility study and sub-sector analysis and preparing a business plan 
    Phase 5: integrating community enterprises into value chain following an analysis of the value chain, identification of appropriate linkages and developing systems for sustainable service delivery

eldis:A22735;Transboundary water cooperation as a tool for conflict prevention;;This paper examines the role of trans-boundary water resource management and cooperation as a tool for preventing broader conflict. It argues that some factors regarding potential contributions to the development of trans-boundary basins have received insufficient attention. These include: intra-sectoral water use efficency including improved methods of irrigation, the selection of more appropriate crops, and the development and use of higher yield cropsinter-sectoral allocative efficiencies. Industrial applications may generate greater value added value for a given unit of water than agriculture basin states should consider virtual water flowsjoint water management and trans-boundary institutions are desirable. These are also closely linked to matters of sovereignty and jurisdictional competence sovereignty-related issues play an important role in determining the allocation of trans-boundary water resources and in the benefit-sharing scenario amongst basin states. The paper concludes that some implications for financing organisations that arise from the study include:water issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency, as the stress on water continues to rise with the rapidly expanding population growth further developments of trans-border water policies are needed, paying attention to funding and assistance to the water sector, while also linking water issues to other sectors and to poverty alleviation decisions on major infrastructure developments and on water management practices as a whole, should apply a holistic vision, extending beyond the Integrated Water Resource Management in cases where there is a basin hegemon, external funding entities should be prepared to offer impartial advice in an attempt to maximize the likelihood of an equitable outcome while there is potential for spill-over in both directions between cooperation on trans-boundary water management and broader international cooperation, all solutions are unique to each given trans-boundary basin, and each set of co-raparians.  ;"A.

eldis:A65065;Media perceptions and portrayals of pastoralists in Kenya, India and China;;"Through the analysis of newspaper articles and a survey of journalists, this publication identifies gaps and highlights differences in how the media portray pastoralism in Kenya, China and India. In discussing their methodology, the authors note that their reliance on national, English-language publications meant that they were not able to include data from vernacular language press in pastoral regions.Although able to make significant contributions to food security, livelihoods and economic prosperity, the benefits of pastoralism often go unnoticed. The authors argue that this is in part due to an overly negative narrative about pastoralism within the media, one that portrays the livelihood as in some way bad and in need of change. The media coverage of pastoralists in the three countries can be summarised as follows.

    Kenya – Pastoralists are mostly featured in ‘bad news’ stories (often concerning drought or conflict) and are portrayed as vulnerable and lacking agency, with almost no mention of benefits.
    China – Presented as a cause of environmental degradation, pastoralists here are viewed as being happy beneficiaries of government investment and settlement projects.
    India – While viewed with more pity (with regard to loss of grazing rights and dwindling pastures), media coverage was rare; journalists responded that pastoralists are ‘invisible’ to news editors.

Having outlined the nature of the media portrayal of pastoralism, the paper then looks at what was missing from the media coverage.

    Pastoral voices, in particular the perspective of women and children, were absent from the majority of news articles (Kenya came out top with 41 per cent of articles featuring a pastoral voice).
    An adequate variety of voices was missing from all three countries. While the vast majority of Chinese articles quoted a government official (82 per cent) with civic groups barely represented (two per cent), this finding was reversed in India (15 per cent and >50 per cent).
    Very few mentions were made across the board regarding the economic importance of pastoralism, and in Kenya and India there was little discussion of government investment.
    Positive portrayals of mobility were rare; more common were narratives that saw mobility as a problem, despite the knowledge, skills and advantages inherent in such techniques.
    Climate change was roundly under-represented; and when it was highlighted, it was to show the vulnerability of pastoralists.

Representatives from Congolese academia, civil society, government agencies and political parties reflected on the different peace agreements and conflict minerals in general and the potential impact of the latest Framework Agreement on Peace and Security in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region signed in Addis Ababa in particular. The conference also discused United Nations Security Council Resolution 2098, which established a rapid intervention brigade. The consensus that emerged during the discussions was that to finally end the conflicts engulfing the DRC, it was necessary to first end illegal mining and the illicit trade in minerals, which were fuelling the violence.

eldis:A30071;Breaking new ground: mining, minerals, and sustainable development;;"This final report presents the findings of the two year IIED MMSD [minerals, mining and sustainable development] project sponsored by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). It outlines in detail the MMSD multistakeholder process -  which included regional patnerships, national projects, global workshops and a range of commissioned research, presentations and bulletins - before presenting a detailed  analysis of the sector through the many stages of minerals and metals exploration, production, use, reuse, recycling, and final disposal. The project uses sustainable development theory as a framework to present priorities for the future development of the sector.Initially the report outlines and discusses key challenges for the sector under the following headings:Viability of the Minerals IndustryThe Control, Use, and Management of LandMinerals and Economic DevelopmentLocal Communities and MinesMining, Minerals, and the EnvironmentAn Integrated Approach to Using MineralsAccess to InformationArtisanal and Small-Scale MiningSector Governance: Roles, Responsibilities, and Instruments for ChangeThe authors then move on to discuss an 'agenda for change' which the sector might follow in order to address expectations which include:countries, especially emerging economies, expect that minerals development will be an engine of sustained national economic growth;local communities expect that the industry will provide employment, infrastructure and other benefits that match the risks and impacts they experience, all within a framework that will leave people better off when the project is over than when it started;the industry’s own employees expect safer and healthier working conditions, a better community life, and some kind of security and consideration if and when their employment ends;local citizens and human rights campaigners expect companies to respect and support basic rights, even when they are operating where government does not;environmental organisations expect a much higher standard of performance, and that the industry will stay out of ecologically and culturally sensitive areas;investors expect higher returns, and have shown dissatisfaction with the industry’s financial results;consumers expect safe products that will not degrade the environment, and that were not produced in substandard conditions.Specific actions which the report calls for include:An Industry Protocol for Sustainable DevelopmentA Commitment to Address the Negative Legacy of the PastSupporting Legalisation of Artisanal and Small-scale MiningIntegrated Management of the Full Mineral ChainMore Effective Government Management of Mineral InvestmentA More Equitable International Trade Regime for Minerals ";;;International Institute for Environment and Development ;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"development;mining;sustainable development;environment;extractive industries";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A30071;http://www.iied.org/mmsd/finalreport/index.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iied.org%2Fmmsd%2Ffinalreport%2Findex.html;;;;"Environment;Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;World Business Council for Sustainable Development;EADI;Trade Policy;Sustainable livelihoods;Environmental impact assessment;Rising powers in international development;WBCSD;extractive;Extractive industries;corporate social responsiblilty;multi-stakeholder;Extractive industries mining;Minerals;CSR"
eldis:A30072;Extractive Sectors and the Poor;;"This paper examines how states that rely on oil and mineral exports address the concerns of the poor. Its central finding is that oil and mineral dependence are strongly associated with unusually bad conditions for the poor. To explain this link, it draws on both original econometric analyses, and recent academic studies.Some of its key findings are:Overall living standards in oil and mineral dependent states are exceptionally low; lower than they should be given their per capita incomes;Higher levels of mineral dependence are strongly correlated with higher poverty rates;Oil and mineral dependent states tend to suffer from exceptionally high rates of child mortality and low life expectancy.Oil dependence (though not mineral dependence) is also associated with high rates of child malnutrition; low spending levels on health care; low enrollment rates in primary and secondary schools; and low rates of adult literacy; Mineral dependence is strongly correlated with income inequality;Both oil and mineral dependent states are exceptionally vulnerable to economic shocks.A set of problems like this might normally lead to calls for government action. But the paper also find that oil and mineral dependence has a harmful effect on governments themselves. Oil and mineral dependent states tend to suffer from unusually high rates of:Corruption;Authoritarian government;Government ineffectiveness;Military spending;Civil war.To address these problems, Oxfam calls for:Oil and mineral dependent states to diversify their economies; and for the World Bank Group and the OECD states to take measures to help this process;Full disclosure of all financial transactions between extractive firms and host governments;International funders to only offer extractive sector assistance to states that have become democratic, and have demonstrated a commitment to fighting poverty;International funders to only support projects in which the host government specifies in advance how the resource revenues are to be used to alleviate poverty, and agrees to independent monitoring to ensure that this occurs.[authors abstract] ";M.

eldis:A19518;Commerce and conflict: Angola & DiamondWorks;;By applying a template for risk assessment to the operations of the Canadian company DiamondWorks in Angola during the 1990’s, this report highlights the complex and dynamic interplay of commerce and conflict. Conclusions and observations arising form the analysis are designed to aid businesses returning to Angola in the creation of corporate strategies designed to avoid disrupting the peace process currently underway in Angola.The report identifies a number of high risk factors that characterised the situation in Angola during the 1990’s, and which are still present to some extent today:rentier/corrupt government: Resulting in weak social and economic infrastructure and a lack of accountability and representationmilitarisation of the diamond industry: Resulting in habitual human rights violations and consistent, low intensity conflict punctuated by high intensity periods of warhigh number of refugees and IDPs: Destabilising the country and negatively impacting already deplorable living standards and human developmentunequal distribution of resourcescorporate participation in violence through use of private security organisations.The report highlights that in such a volatile situation, a company can choose from three different ways of operating:they can work around the conflict, by treating the conflict as an impediment or negative externality that is to be avoidedthey can work in the conflict, by developing a risk mitigation approach to business operationsthey can work on the conflict, by which involves conscious attempts by the MNC to conduct business with its’ primary focus on conflict prevention, management, and resolution.With regards to DiamondWorks operations, it can be said that their activities in Angola were largely attempts to work around and in the conflict. DiamondWorks sought to “conflict proof” its operations through the use of private security organisations and personal-use infrastructure. This, however, did not bring about the desired results. For the future companies that want to operate in Angola will have to develop  corporate policies that avoid aggravating a still fragile situation. ;"A. Stevens

eldis:A17575;Pastoralism on the margin;;This report focuses on the sustainability of pastoralism in the lowlands of the Great Rift of East Africa and the Horn, arguing that pastoralism as a mode of production and a way of life has entered a phase of decline, often accompanied by conflict, drought, famine and flooding.The report details the historic evolution and chief characteristics of pastoralism, discussing the eras of colonialism and independence, livestock development, land tenure and conflict, as well as local and regional politics. It focuses on the main approaches for stakeholders in dealing with the decline of pastoralism, detailing the main areas that need to be addressed and strengthened if pastoralism is be sustainable in the long term:The human rights approach: in particular the UN Declaration that requires states not only to protect all human rights and freedoms without discrimination, but to promote them through appropriate policies and legislation.  The author argues that international law is weak in a region where group rights are likely to be respected only when corresponding political power can be brought to bear on the state, which is not the case for the majority of pastoralist groupsThe environmental approach: argues that mobile livestock production is the only ecologically sustainable land use strategy for the fragile ecosystems of the region. Evidence of areas that have turned into dust-bowls when cultivation replaced livestock grazing supports this approach according to the reportThe economic approach: singled out as the most effective method, which relies on showing the contribution that mobile livestock production makes to local and national economies.In strengthening pastoralism throughout East Africa and the Horn, the report makes a number of recommendations to national governments and donor agencies.Recommendations to the governments of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda include:governments should fulfil their obligations to implement in full international human rights treatiesensure that the rights of pastoralist women are protected in theory and practiseensure that recognised systems of land tenure includes the protection of the use of land by pastoralistsdesign electoral systems and other forms of participation that allow women to be equally represented in governmentPoverty Reduction Strategies Paper should recognise and address pastoralism concerns.Recommendations to donor agencies include:existing and new donor projects should be reviewed for any effect they may have on pastoralist way of life, particularly land usesupport new and existing mechanisms that fairly determine pastoralists right to land usefunding of education should be evaluated.[adapted from author] ;J.

eldis:A17572;Gold Rush: The impact of gold mining on poor people in Obuasi in Ghana;;Report highlighting how poor communities in Obuasi, Ghana are suffering environmental pollution and social problems apparently as a result of gold mining activity. It examines how rivers and streams have been polluted with arsenic, iron, manganese and heavy metals from past gold mining activities by Anglo American’s subsidiary, AngloGold Ashanti (AGA) and its predecessor, Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (AGC).According to the report AGA is failing to report its activities accurately to shareholders and the public and some of these failures are serious. There are at least three areas in which evidence collected by this report contradicts claims made by AGA:on-going water contamination up to 38 times above maximum legal limits, environmental damage and toxic flooding affecting local food security in the Obuasi areadiscrepancies between AGA’s claims to have provided adequate compensation after a toxic spill and testimony by local witnessescompany claims that Awudu Mohammed, a suspected illegal miner, was not shot on 21 June 2005 are contradicted by evidence obtained by this reportThe report is calling for tougher domestic company laws worldwide and also for new international laws to regulate corporations and their subsidiaries to help ensure greater respect for peoples’ rights. The report argues that tougher reporting requirements and greater legal duties on directors of UK-listed companies to take steps to minimise any negative social and environmental impacts on communities overseas could help prevent some of the issues. The report also lists a number of specific recommendations for AngloGold Ashanti, the Ghana government and the UK government. ;;;ActionAid International;eldis;01/01/2006;en;"mining;extractive industries";;;"202;GHA";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A17572;http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/gold_rush.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.actionaid.org.uk%2Fdoc_lib%2Fgold_rush.pdf;;;;"Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;Gold;AngloGold Ashanti;Business and the environment;Extractive industries;AngloAmerican;Extractive industries mining"
eldis:A28601;Rural water tenure in East Africa: a comparative study of legal regimes and community responses to changing tenure patterns in Tanzania and Kenya;;"This paper looks at the water policy of Tanzania, and makes comparisons with the situation in Kenya. It focuses especially on recent attempts to move towards a participatory, demand-management approach to rural water supply. This focus on rural water availability is motivated by the fact that approximately 80% of the population of Africa is found in rural areas, and only about 37% of these people have access to 'safe' water sources.Policy Issues:The changes in the land tenure system and ownership patterns 'on the ground' should be monitored to assess the effects on water issues in both Kenya and Tanzania Clear guidelines on conflict prevention and resolution should be developed at the regional/national levelThe Water Rights allocation system should be reviewed at the same time as the existing Rights themselves are renewed and/or annulled. A participatory review process, involving a cross-section of water users (both those with Rights and without) and Ministry of Water staff from all levels, should be instituted Water sources should be ranked according to the threat of degradation, in terms of quantity and quality. It should prioritise monitoring and enforcement activities accordingly. This may be a good way of mobilising funding, through identifying particular problems and strategiesWater-management institutions should divide revenue into recipient end-users -and usesAny ""resource and catchment conservation charge"" should be carefully-judged to reflect the financial capacity of the paying community, and should be transparently directed towards effective conservation measuresAgainst a background of conflicting interests and widespread inefficiencies in the use of water, the importance of 'umbrella' community institutions, which represent a number of communities is clearThe activities of agencies working in the area of water supply should be co-ordinated at regular meetings hosted by the district or regional authoritiesIt is important in many areas that technical capacity to plan, maintain and repair water systems should be improved at the local level In cases where water systems are 'handed over' from NGOs or the Ministry of Water to local community institutions, a form of contract is necessary to ensure that the system infrastructure is clearly under the ownership of a specified institutionAs non-state stakeholders increase their abilities to manage water and to operate at a policy level, particularly umbrella organisations representing smallholders, they should be increasingly included in the government water allocation institutions ";C.

eldis:A100906;Gender and Peri-urban water security;;As geographical areas subjected to rapid urbanisation and constantly  changing land use, peri-urban sites offer women and men greater economic opportunities.At the sametime,peri-urbanresidents are also drawn away from traditionalmeans of livelihood.As the city encroaches into prime agricultural lands in the fringe areas,occupations become more subsistence in nature.  This increases women's workload. Often women, who migrate from rural areas after marriage and settle in peri-urban zones,face enormous challenges in accessing water. In peri-urban contexts,water is shared and accessed informally by most stakeholders and users.This research brief underscores challenges,hazards,and opportunities in accessing water resources and  their gender consequences.

eldis:A23744;Eye on EITI: civil society perspectives and recommendations on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;;"Launched in September 2002, EITI brings together representatives from governments, oil, gas, and mining companies, and civil society to address the paradox that has come to be known as the ""resource curse"" in which two-thirds of the world’s poorest people inhabit countries rich in natural resources. This report presents their insights into the realities of EITI implementation in specific countries and presents recommendations on what is needed to ensure success.In the four years since its launch, EITI has recorded some notable achievements. Twenty-one governments of resource-rich countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Central Asia have endorsed the initiative and the International Advisory Group (IAG) has developed many of the necessary guidelines, criteria, and governance structures. However, as this report demonstrates, there is great room for improvement. Of the 21 endorsing countries: two have published fully audited and reconciled EITI reportseight have yet to take even the initial step of appointing an individual to lead the EITI processten have not yet formed the required multi-stakeholder committeeeleven do not have a drafted and approved work plan.In order that further progress is made in improving financial transparency in the extractive industries and ensuring this translates into improved accountability and use of revenues, the report offers a number of recommendations. They include:Protect the credibility of EITI by ensuring that rhetorical commitments are matched by concrete actions within meaningful timeframesin each country, appoint a leader with the time, bureaucratic skill, and political influence to drive EITI implementationrecognise that genuine civil society participation is a requirement of EITI and support its active engagement in each critical step of the EITI processensure that no civil society campaigner is harassed or intimidated for their work to promote transparencyensure that civil society representatives are genuinely from that sector and not from those representing the interests of others such as political parties or companiesincrease financial and technical support to build civil society’s capacity to participate in EITI.[adapted from author] ";;;Publish What You Pay;eldis;01/01/2006;en;extractive industries;;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A23744;http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/english/pdf/pubs/eyeoneiti.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publishwhatyoupay.org%2Fenglish%2Fpdf%2Fpubs%2Feyeoneiti.pdf;;;;"Accountability Government;Private sector corruption;Corporate Social Responsibility;extractive industries;Good governance corruption;Political corruption;Good Governance;Accountability private sector;Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;mining revenues;gas revenues;Business and corruption;Extractive industries;transparency;Good governance accountability;oil revenues;Resource curse;Governance;EITI"
eldis:A32440;Advancing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;;"This report examines the benefits that a resource-rich country can derive from endorsing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and implementing its Principles. It also searches for courses of action that the EITI Board can pursue to persuade more countries to endorse EITI. Both issues are investigated in the context of Angola, Indonesia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The authors argue that EITI is particularly beneficial for countries that suffer from the so-called “resource curse”. In these countries the natural resource wealth paradoxically does not lead to growth and reduction of poverty. The reasons for this are poor governance and corruption, inappropriate expansion of public spending, excessive borrowing and the collapse of other sectors. Three principle recommendations are made to the EITI Board: 

    prioritise among countries. Focus on those countries that offer the potential to generate tangible results within the next three years. 
     position EITI as “good cop” and outsource the “bad cop” to civil society and media. Frame EITI as an institution that offers assistance and helps countries to placate critics. Create momentum for EITI by exercising pressure. 
     formalise EITI’s positive impact on sovereign risk ratings and offer improved access to private capital as an incentive for the implementation of EITI principles.

The paper stresses that water security needs to be included in the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG process must incorporate a goal and related targets for achieving water security, as this will address multiple priority development areas under consideration. The paper also argues that investment in water security is a long-term pay-off for human development and economic growth, with immediate visible short-term gains. ;;;UN-Water;eldis;01/01/2013;en;"climate change;research";Land, Climate change & Environment;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A64947;http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/watersecurity_analyticalbrief.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in%2Ffiles%2Ffile%2Fwatersecurity_analyticalbrief.pdf;;;;"Global Governance;SDGs;Climate change;International climate change negotiations;Water in climate change;CDKN;research;Governance;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;tfmimport;Funder"
eldis:A101484;Can workplace secondments build trust in the mining sector?;;"Mutual suspicion has characterised the relationship between the South African government and mining companies, particularly in recent years. Resolving the current impasse would require a panoply of policy interventions because of the complexity and age of the mining industry. This briefing proposes that one such intervention could be the introduction of a structured workplace secondment programme between the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) and mining companies – together identifying critical areas for co-operation and skills transfer. A well-managed and properly resourced secondment programme offers the potential to deepen understanding, share expertise, improve trust and ultimately facilitate a more functional and productive sector. Secondments carry their own risks, but these can be mitigated through rigorous design, and are far outweighed by the risk of doing nothing to alter the status quo. Recommendations:The Department of Mineral Resources should take the lead in establishing a long-term partnership with the private sector for an ongoing workplace secondment programme for public servants into mining companiesthe programme should be assigned sufficient human and financial resources to succeed. It should be co-designed by the government and the private sector; target mutually agreed critical areas for building expertise; and be co-funded by the state and the private sectorrigorous upfront design and consultation should be undertaken to mitigate risks and ensure a coherent and tightly managed process, right through to the secondees’ return to their workplace ";J.

eldis:A45892;Access to water: a woman’s right?;;"Having enough water for food production is a key issue in many countries. As water becomes scarce and food requirements increase, there will be a need to produce more food using less water, to protect the quality of water and the environment, particularly in Africa. To achieve this, it will be necessary to improve women’s access rights to water.Research from
the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations looks at the
issues facing poor communities, and especially women, trying to ensure access
to water. Water is a scarce resource in many countries and water-use
decisions are difficult. However, access to water for poor communities is
necessary if countries are going to meet the first Millennium Development Goal
of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. 
There are many demands for water
in developing countries. 
Irrigation schemes can increase crop production
and enable farmers to diversify into higher value crops.
Rain-fed agriculture relies on moisture
preservation measures and water harvesting. 
Aquaculture provides both income and food. Coastal
and lake fisheries are sustainable because they do not reduce the water supply
and can be combined with other activities.
Food processing and marketing require water for
cooking. These activities provide income in rural and urban areas.
Using water for cooking and washing places a
major burden on supplies and often requires women and children to travel long
distances to fetch supplies.
In most parts of the world, women
play in key role in these activities. Their knowledge of water conditions and
the environment is a vital factor in their ability to provide enough food for
their families. However, very few women own land. Only ten percent of female
farmers own land in India, Nepal and Thailand (even less in other countries)
making it difficult for women to gain access water which is often on other people’s land. 
Water shortages can also cause
problems. With so competing demands on limited water supplies, many regions
need tighter controls over use. One solution would be to raise water prices,
which, in theory, encourage more efficient use, but this is unfair on poor
people and in fact reduces their access to water. 
Policies need to increase poor
people’s access to water, especially landless women. This will require strong
measures such as:

Governments must promote the participation of women
in water resource management. South Africa has already successfully
achieved this.
Women must become active members of water users
associations, including leadership positions.
Women must have more influence in the planning and
management of farm activities. 
Water is needed to restore degraded land. The local
knowledge of both men and women can assist this process, along with an
understanding of the ways poor people use land.

In many places, customs and laws
determine women’s access to water and their role in water-related activities.
These can be hard to overcome, but women must have more influence in determining
patterns of water use and access. This is very important if this increasingly
scarce resource is to be used in the most efficient and productive ways.

eldis:A22343;Vietnam Red River Delta irrigation management: incomplete recognition of local institutional innovations;;Prepared as part of a study on innovations for irrigation management, this report analyses the history of changes and processes around the de-collectivisation of agriculture in Vietnam in the 1980s.At this time, emerging farming households in the Red River Delta became directly involved in agriculture. New water service requirements arose from de-collectivisation. Former irrigation and drainage management companies (IDMC) lowered their involvement in irrigation activities to the benefit of cooperatives that developed local irrigation capacities. The paper asks the questions: How extensive was this evolution? Has this technical evolution had impact on the institutional framework of the activity? To what extent are farming households involved in decision making?The paper finds that the Vietnamese State was not able to combine flexibility with accountability. It combined strong top-level policy with an inability to monitor their implementation at the local level. The present challenge is to create formal room for water management flexibility. This would improve water management if farmer participation is stimulated and cooperative social and collective mandates are respected. ;J-P.

eldis:A70981;Climate Change, Out-migration and Agrarian Stress: The Potential for Upscaling Small-scale Water Storage in Nepal;;"This report explores the potential role of small-scale water storage infrastructure in two subbasins within the larger Koshi River Basin in central and eastern Nepal, yet shows that upscaling such infrastructure requires an appreciation of the other drivers of change in agriculture aside from climate (e.g., rising cost of living and poor terms of trade for agriculture). It also identifies the social relations and dynamics (distribution of land, water and labour) which could mediate the success of future interventions. It is clear from the research that, while small-scale water storage has the potential to significantly strengthen livelihoods in the Nepali hills, it is necessary to tailor projects to the existing political-economic context.

eldis:A16722;Rush and ruin: the devastating mineral trade in Southern Katanga;;This report explores how the illicit trade in cobalt and copper in Katanga (south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo) is contributing to the destruction of the country’s economy, the environment as well as the livelihoods of thousands of Congolese people.As the report demonstrates, the volume of the illegal mineral trade is immense. In March 2004 the Central Bank of Congo reported the DRC produced 783 tonnes of cobalt metal. In the same month, the DRC’s customs office reported 13,365 tonnes of cobalt metal was exported, a difference of over 12,00 tonnes, which can be accounted to the illicit trade.This huge volume of illegal trade takes away the crucial mining revenues from the copperbelt, which could provide much-needed revenue for the Congolese government to support the economic development that the DRC so desperately needs.In addition, the illegal trade breeds poverty and instability. Artisanal mining is being carried out in dangerous and uncontrolled conditions, with thousands of miners risking their lives to earn around US$1 a day. The DRC has in place a new Mining Code designed to attract foreign investment by providing a legal framework that provides clarity and certainty. However, due to a lack of regulatory capacity and possible also political will, the Code is yet to be applied on the ground in Katanga.The report offers a number of recommendations, including:the international donor communityand the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) should put pressure on the transitional government to publicly disclose existing mining contracts and revenuesIFIs and the donor community should commit themselves to developing alternative employment opportunities for ex- workers and other unemployed people in Katangathe transitional government should commit itself to making anti-corruption, transparency and accountability priority areas by publishing the results of systems and finance audits of the Ministry of Mines, Cadastre Minier and Ministry of Finance. ;;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"environment;mining;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"202;COD";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A16722;http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/217/Rush%20and%20Ruin%20-%20Sept%2004.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Fmedia_library_get.php%2F217%2FRush%2520and%2520Ruin%2520-%2520Sept%252004.pdf;;;;"copper;transparency;cobalt;Environment;Biodiversity and environment;Extractive industries mining;Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;Extractive industries;Minerals;(DRC)"

eldis:A11012;Zoning—lessons from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;;"Over the last 25 years a range of management ‘tools’, including zoning plans, permits, education, and more recently management plans, have been applied to regulate access and to control and mitigate impacts associated with human use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park GBRMP.A multiple-use zoning approach provides high levels of protection for speci c areas whilst allowing reasonable uses, including certain  shing activities, to continue in other zones. Zoning has long been regarded as a cornerstone of Marine Park management,
separating con icting uses through application of the various zones and determining the appropriateness of various activities. Zoning in the GBRMP has evolved and changed considerably since the  rst zoning plan in 1981, along with other management approaches.This paper outlines what aspects of zoning have worked well, what has necessarily changed, and the zoning lessons learned from over two decades of ‘adaptive management’.

eldis:A37540;Mitigating the impact of climate change and land degradation through IFAD’s COSOP in Viet Nam.;;"This report analyses the impact of climate change and land degradation on agriculture and related sectors in Viet Nam. It intends to guide the project based on the design of the Country Strategic Opportunities Paper (COSOP) priorities and to identify supplementary financing for International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) projects from the UNFCCC and other carbon related financing mechanisms. It is explained that the harmful effects of climate change are already being experienced in Viet Nam, and farming communities have begun to respond by: 

    introducing livestock breeds that can withstand increased temperatures
    shifting crop varieties such as from rice to maize
    introducing drought resistant crop varieties
    adopting water saving methods. 

Over the last century, average temperatures in the Mekong region have risen by 0.3 to 0.8°C. Further temperature increases are expected along with more extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall, and rising sea levels. However, considering that more than three-quarters of Viet Nam’s labour force is engaged in the agriculture sector, the scale of interventions will need to be significantly increased if continued economic growth is to be achieved. Key policy implications include:

    forward planning and implementation of a rural development and agriculture strategy that is knowledgeable about climate change will help offset many of its harmful effects
    IFAD should consider supporting Viet Nam in its current efforts to develop a climate change Mitigation and Adaptation Action Plan for the agricultural and rural development sector as a contribution to the National Strategy and Action Framework for Climate Change
    given the geographic scale and time horizon being discussed, IFAD will need to pursue a multi-pronged approach that supports Viet Nam in developing the enabling framework concurrently with on-the ground adaptation and mitigation measures
    focus areas suggested for informing Viet Nam’s Mitigation and Adaptation Action Plan include: continued work on securing access for the rural poor to land and forest resources, adoption of food security measures (safety nets) and provision of alternative livelihood options.

eldis:A101023;Land, farming and Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): a case study of the Middle Manyame Sub-Catchment;;Zimbabwe's water reforms that were undertaken in the 1990s were meant to redress the colonially inherited inequalities to agricultural water, increase water security against frequent droughts, improve water management, and realise sustainable financing of the water sector. They were underpinned by the 1998 Water and Zimbabwe National Water Authority Acts, which were based on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principles. This article describes how IWRM has been implemented against a backdrop of an ever - ev olving land reform programme and a struggling agriculture sector. We examine how water is accessed and used in and around three water sources in the Middle Manyame Sub-Catchment, one of the seven sub-catchments of the Manyame Catchment. The Sub-Catchment is of particular significance because there was significant agricultural production on white-owned large-scale farmers, which have now been extensively allocated to small black farmers. The study demonstrated that while the land reform has, in theory, broad ened access to water, irrigation water usage has remained low because of a depressed agriculture sector, shortage and high costs of electricity, and lack of capital needed to restore damaged or stolen irrigation equipment. The findings indicate that the as sumption of a self-financing water sector, based on a well-functioning agriculture sector, which is the largest water user, has not been realised, and this has negatively affected implementation of IWRM in the Middle Manyame area and in Zimbabwe in general. ;"Takunda Hove

eldis:A101024;Whose waters? Large-scale agricultural development and water grabbing in the Wami-Ruvu River Basin, Tanzania;;In Tanzania like in other parts of the global South, in the name of 'development' and 'poverty eradication' vast tracts of land have been earmarked by the government to be developed by investors for different commercial agricultural projects, giving rise to the contested land grab phenomenon. In parallel, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM ) has been promoted in the country and globally as the governance framework that seeks to manage water resources in an efficient, equitable and sustainable manner. This article asks how IWRM manages the competing interests as well as the diverse priorities of both large and small water users in the midst of foreign direct investment. By focusing on two commercial sugar companies operating in the Wami-Ruvu River Basin in Tanzania and their impacts on the water and land rights of the surrounding villages, the article asks whether institutional and capacity weaknesses around IWRM implementation can be exploited by powerful actors that seek to meet their own interests, thus allowing water grabbing to take place. The paper thus highlights the power, interests and alliances of the various actors involved in the governance of water resources. By drawing on recent conceptual insights from the water grabbing literature, the empirical findings suggest that the IWRM framework indirectly and directly facilitates the phenomenon of water grabbing to take place in the Wami-Ruvu River Basin in Tanzania. ;"Aurelia van Eeden

The issues are identified as health, displacement, detention, urbanisation and natural disasters. The countries where ICRC is working include Iraq, Haiti, Somalia and Yemen. The publication analyses challenges from the point of view of the operational practice that has developed. It makes the following observations: 

    water is life and it should be protected by international humanitarian law
    the planet is undergoing climate changes that will determine the management of water resources
    half of the world population live in urban areas
    the nature of armed conflict has changed for the worse and the people's living conditions are at the heart of ICRC's response
    the response is more effective if implemented in cooperation with the beneficiary communities. 

The publication concludes by stating that global changes will determine new avenues and solutions to be pursued to ensure that the ICRC's response is still appropriate to the needs of the people affected by future conflicts.

eldis:A72587;What climate services do farmers and pastoralists need in Tanzania?;;This report presents final findings from the baseline data collection exercise conducted for Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) Adaptation Programme in Africa. The GFCS programme, having a focus on agriculture, food security, health and disaster risk reduction, is implemented in Tanzania and Malawi. Under the auspices of this GFCS project, the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) is responsible to support baseline data collection and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to evaluate climate services for farmers and pastoralists in Tanzania. The purpose of this report is to inform national partners on farmers’ current access and needs for climate information services. Communities of agro-pastoralists and pastoralists interviewed have little access to climate information, which is generally not associated with agricultural advice. To increase the relevance and communication of climate information in their communities, respondents have recommended training of local extension agents and traditional leaders on the concepts of climate information, having site specific information and using local languages and brochures. The forecasts of greatest interest include start of the rain and expected amount of rainfall over the season. Preferred formats cited by men are radio messages, visits from extension agents while women selected voice message on cell phones and villages communicators. Messengers suggested for radio presenters, local extension agents and village leaders highly recommended by women. The Adaptation Program in Africa, which targets Tanzania and Malawi, is the first multi-agency initiative to be implemented under GFCS. It is a 3-year project, funded by the Government of Norway, that aims to strengthen capacity both to develop and use climate services and combines cutting-edge science with traditional knowledge. ;J.Y.

eldis:A101933;Legal limits to tribal governance:  coal mining in Meghalaya, India;;Land in Meghalaya, India, was traditionally agricultural land, owned by the community. With increasing privatization and rising commercial value of land for non-agricultural use, many owners have sold the land for mining operations. So-called rat-hole coal mining has resulted in environmental degradation as well as in the loss of lives of miners, most of whom are from outside the state. The National Green Tribunal has banned coal mining until safer, more environmentally sound policies and practices are in place. Critics in Meghalaya claim that the ban encroaches on the tribal way of life and point to constitutional provisions exempting Meghalaya from the purview of national mining laws. However, the courts are clear: Meghalaya’s exemptions do not allow them to violate the constitutional right to life of all Indian citizens. The traditional institutions are not strong enough to mitigate the rising inequality among citizens following from mining and other commercial operations. ;H. Stokke;;Chr.

eldis:A42268;From conflict to peacebuilding: the role of natural resources and the environment;;"Conflicts associated with natural resources are twice as likely to relapse into conflict in the first five years, an imminent report suggests. Indeed the natural resource curse has been a primary determinant of intra-state conflict in terrible theatres of war such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia. Yet it extends far beyond the battle to acquire precious commodities. With climate change and population growth placing ever-increasing demands on the environment, it is widely recognised that conflict over basic resources, such as water and arable land, will increase – see Darfur and the Middle East. This new report from the UN calls for environment and natural resource issues to be integrated into peacebuilding, decrying that less than a quarter of peace negotiations aiming to resolve conflicts linked to natural resources have addressed resource management mechanisms. The authors draw three main conclusions from their research: 

    natural resources and the environment can be implicated in all phases of the conflict cycle, contributing to the outbreak and perpetuation of violence and undermining prospects for peace
    the environment can itself fall victim to conflict, as direct and indirect environmental damage, coupled with the collapse of institutions, can lead to environmental risks that threaten health, livelihoods and security
    natural resources and the environment can contribute to peacebuilding through economic development, employment generation and sustainable livelihoods 

And offer a number of recommendations, including: 

    further develop UN capacities for early warning and early action - include environmental and natural resource issues in international and regional conflict early warning systems and develop expertise for preventive action
    improve oversight and protection of natural resources during conflicts - develop international certification mechanisms to ensure that natural resources can be tracked more effectively
    address natural resources and the environment as part of the peacemaking and peacekeeping process - ensure that there are processes in place within peace agreements for the transparent, equitable and legitimate definition and realisation of property rights and resource revenues and tenure
    integrate natural resource and environmental issues into post-conflict planning - systematically conduct post-conflict environmental assessments that identify environmental risks to human health, livelihoods and security and prioritize needs in the short and medium term.

eldis:A41339;Malawi's green gold: challenges and opportunities for small and medium forest enterprises in reducing poverty;;"Approximately 85% of Malawi’s population live in rural areas and depend in some way on forests for their livelihoods. Recent government policies have highlighted how forest resources could do more to help reduce poverty through the development of small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs). This scoping  study describes the main opportunities and constraints facing SMFEs in Malawi.The authors draw on field-based interviews with entrepreneurs involved in four different forest product value chains - plantation timber, cane furniture, fruit juice and wood carving - and an analysis of national policies and how they affect SMFEs.The study finds that, excluding cane products, the demand for most SMFE products seems strong. As a  result, the increasing pressure that SMFEs put on the forest is a major challenge, both for them and the country. The perception that SMFEs are acting illegally and pose a threat to the natural environment may translate into more hostile government policies. However, the advantage of SMFEs is that the resource on which they depend is renewable if properly managed. International demand is high for ‘natural’ and  community-based’ products which offers an opportunity for SMFEs to reduce local poverty through their businesses.The implications for government policy include:

    there is a need for champions of SMFEs to clearly articulate to government and NGOs that SMFEs can play a role in the sustainable management of forest resources
    there is also a need to demonstrate the potential of the SMFE sector as an engine for economic growth and poverty reduction
    security of resource access is key to encouraging financial service providers to offer affordable credit to SMFEs - potential investors must also be helped to see the SMFE subsector as an area with potential for growth and investment
    governments should consider creating credit guarantee schemes and a credit reference bureau to assist SMFEs to access loans from non-government finance institutions
    to achieve economies of scale, improve production processes and encourage further investment, producer associations must be formed and strengthened - this can be achieved through training and encouraging the formation of a full-time secretariat
    while the majority of current policies and programmes appear to be supportive of SMFEs, the Department of Forestry should play a more proactive role in developing SMFEs, not just in monitoring and controlling forest use.

eldis:A42186;Agriculture in urban planning: generating livelihoods and food security;;"This report, by researchers working in urban agriculture (UA), examines concrete strategies to integrate city farming into the urban landscape. Drawing on original field work in cities across the rapidly urbanising global South, the book examines the contribution of UA and city farming to livelihoods and food security. The case studies covered by the authors, focus on the following aspects of urban agriculture:

    food production diversification for robust and secure food provision 
    the socio-economic and agronomic aspects of urban composting
    urban agriculture as a viable livelihood strategy 
    strategies for integrating city farming into urban landscapes 
    complex social-ecological networks of urban agriculture 
    public health aspects including the impact of pesticides, micro-biological risks, pollution and water contamination on food production and people. 

Ultimately the book calls on city farmers, politicians, environmentalists, and regulatory bodies to work together to improve the long term sustainability of urban farming as a major secure source of food and employment for urban populations. It also concludes that UA is now part of the debate on how to improve our cities - it is now a recognised field of research that has seen some rapid policy development in the past 15 years. This is because UA supports livelihoods and generates an economic value from land that would otherwise be idle or vacant. Its economic impact reaches far beyond farmers: it stimulates employment further along the chain of production for those who market, transport and sell produce, as well as for those who provide the tools and other means of production.

Most of the discussion will focus on three steppe-based villages in northern Syria, where the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) undertook a three-year survey between 1978 and 1981, and where a follow-up study was done this year. However, this paper will also draw on studies centering on other villages in northern Syria, in order to fully explain the parallels between areas which were settled earlier and those currently being developed. ;"M.

eldis:A68423;Assessing drought displacement risk for Kenyan, Ethiopian and Somali pastoralists;;"This study represents an initial attempt to assess patterns of displacement related to droughts in selected countries of the Horn of Africa, specifically the border regions of Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.

The analysis is based on a mathematical model, IDMC’s innovative Pastoralist Livelihoods and Displacement Simulator, a real-time tool that estimates displacement outcomes based on interactions between climate and human-induced factors. The study explores several scenarios to identify potential impacts of climate change and demographic trends and to test the effectiveness of measures to prevent and respond to droughts. Therefore, the primary intended audience for this paper are those in national and regional governments responsible for reducing and managing disaster risks – drought in particular – and for protecting the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs).

eldis:A63657;Applying the concept of human security to research on the consequences of mining-induced displacement and resettlement;;The development of international mining projects is one of the most visible consequences of globalisation. But developments in the mining industry are the cause of about 10.3 percent of all displacements in the world. This means that more than a million people per year may be resettled as a result of resource extraction in various parts of the globe. Countries displaying the greatest growth rate of this phenomenon include India, China, Ghana, and many other African counties. The most burning issue is the establishment of large open-pit mines in developing countries, such as the Tarkwa Mine in Ghana, and the Tedi and Porgera Mines in Papua Island. The impact of mining on the dynamics of internal displacements remains a topic rarely analysed research. Authors are more concerned with displacements induced by the construction of large dams and the creation of national parks or by ongoing urbanisation processes. Instead of contributing to the well-being of local communities, the extraction of resources leads to a growing number of resettlements, environmental destruction, and a deterioration of the situation of marginalised groups. The consequences of the aforementioned problem do not diverge significantly from other categories of development-induced displacements such as oil-induced displacement, dam-induced displacement, or conservation-induced displacement. The analysis of internal displacement has become the focus of different fields of study. Sociology, social anthropology, human rights and development studies, and even philosophy are amongst disciplines particularly useful in the exploration of the consequences of development induced displacement. Research into this category of displacements, now under development for more than 40 years, has prompted the creation of specific theoretical concepts (i.e. the IRR model). The notion of human security also appears to be a useful scientific tool for more in-depth social analyses. Classification included in the Human Development Report published in 1994 distinguishes seven basic aspects of human security: economic security, food security, personal security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. Extraction of mineral resources leads to substantial threats to each of these aspects. An application of the aforementioned classifications to the research on the consequences of mining-induced displacement and resettlement helps to understand the broader context of problems encountered by the displacees. However, it should also be supplemented by two specific categories: gender security and cultural security. ;B.

eldis:A38048;Making the most of scarcity: accountability for better water management results in the Middle East and North Africa;;"Part of a series of development reports, this paper highlights the key challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa Region (MENA). In particular, it aims to show how water is integrated into the wider economic policies of the countries of the region and for that reason, it brings water issues to non-water specialists, addressing a multi-sectoral audience. It is argued that despite its diversity of landscapes and climates - from the snowy peaks of the Atlas mountains to the empty quarter of the Arabian peninsula - most of the region’s countries cannot meet current water demand. It is estimated that per capita water availability will fall by half by 2050, with serious consequences for the region’s already-stressed aquifers and natural hydrological systems. A series of technical and policy changes to the water sector in most MENA countries is needed if the countries are to accelerate their progress in the water policy arena and avoid the economic and social hardships that might otherwise occur. Potential solutions to the region’s water problems are well known but have often not been implemented because of constraints in the broader political economy. However, the authors assert, water need not be a constraint to economic development and social stability in MENA. Strong and diversified economies are themselves likely to give governments more political space for the reforms necessary to improve water management. Key actions that could be undertaken include:

    planning that integrates water quality and considers the entire water system including the promotion of demand management and irrigation, strengthening of government agencies, decentralising responsibility for delivering water services to financially autonomous utilities, and stronger enforcement of environmental regulations 
    developing measures that improve accountability for water planning and services tend to push the political economy toward more sustainable water management. These measures add information to the decision making process, give service providers incentives to improve performance, and reduce the chances that small groups will benefit disproportionately 
    evaluate the level and efficiency of public expenditure on water: Ministries of finance, economy, planning, trade, and agriculture need to know how much public money is spent on water and whether it is spent efficiently 
    define goals for public spending and cost recovery: governments, through the political process, determine the level of public spending on water that is appropriate for their circumstances. Governments can reduce public expenditure without reducing investment or services while recovering the costs from the beneficiaries.

A report by Amnesty International examines possible roots of human rights abuses that might occur in the context of this foreign direct investment.The report argues that certain aspects of the agreement, primarily due to a lack of clarity,  may signal a disregard for the international framework set up to protect human rights and could:hold back the governments of Chad and Cameroon, which have poor track records on human rights, from taking steps to improve the human rights protection of those affected by the pipeline projectmake it more difficult to hold the consortium to account for abuses of human rights that result from its activitiesencourage the governments of Chad and Cameroon to ignore their human rights obligations, by claiming that the agreements prevent them from taking measures that would destabilise the financial equilibrium of the project, even if such measures are intended to respect, protect and fulfil human rightsbe interpreted to allow the oil companies to extract and transport oil and operate the pipeline project free from full accountability under domestic laws against human rights abuses.The report calls on governments, international financial institutions and companies involved in the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project to revise the project agreements to include an explicit guarantee that nothing in the agreements can be used to undermine either the human rights obligations of the states or the human rights responsibilities of the companies. In particular Amnesty International is urging that the investment agreements:allow the regulation of actions of the companies involved, to ensure that they do not abuse human rightsremove obstacles to progressive realisation of human rightsavoid placing a price tag on human rightsgive precedence to international human rights law over industry standardsrespect the right to an effective remedyensure the right to equalityprotect labour rights and the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. ;;;Amnesty International ;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;"TCD;202;CMR";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A20356;http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/POL34/012/2005/en/76f5b921-d4bf-11dd-8a23-d58a49c0d652/pol340122005en.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amnesty.org%2Fen%2Flibrary%2Fasset%2FPOL34%2F012%2F2005%2Fen%2F76f5b921-d4bf-11dd-8a23-d58a49c0d652%2Fpol340122005en.pdf;;;;"Human rights;human rights abuse;pipeline;Exxon;International capital flows;Extractive industries;investment agreement;International capital flows FDI;Extractive industries oil;Finance policy;corporate social responsibility;oil;Petronas;Chevron;Foreign Direct Investment;Corporate Social Responsibility;Business and human rights;CSR"

eldis:A12731;Finding the way forward: how could voluntary action move mining towards sustainable development?;;"This report is primarily based on a review of research into the role of voluntary activities in the mining sector. The possible development of a global voluntary initiative (or initiatives) is a theme explored here in greater detail by addressing the following questions:What are the key drivers for sustainable development in the mining industry?What could voluntary initiatives achieve in the sector?What voluntary initiatives currently exist?What form of voluntary initiative is best?The report finds that there are few similarities among the initiatives currently in use in the mining and other sectors – this may reflect tailoring of initiatives to their respective goals, but it may also indicate a lack of sharing or development between initiatives. In the mining sector, there are indications that a high degree of confusion exists about which initiatives are appropriate and useful; in some companies, a feeling of ‘initiative overload’ heightens this uncertainty.Most initiatives fall into two categories:‘Broad guiding principles’ require a low level of commitment and hence tend to attract many signatories‘Differentiation mechanisms’, with third-party assurance against well-defined performance standards, may require a significant compliance effort from companies and tend to receive a lower uptake rateArguably, initiatives of both types are struggling to deliver real change in environmental and social conditions ‘on the ground’.A real ‘net move’ towards sustainable development by any  industry sector can only be achieved by initiatives that require a concrete commitment from signatories to improve performance but that also attract high uptake by fulfilling a key ‘need’ or by linking to a significant driver for business performance. Few if any initiatives fulfil these requirements at present, although many existing schemes have only recently been developed and may yet grow to fill this role. Examples include the Forest Stewardship Council, a certification scheme for sustainably sourced forest products.The mining industry cannot address the challenge of sustainable development on its own; its operations are too closely interlinked with government, communities, the financial sector, and wider societal expectations. Certification is one option, however, that could draw the industry and key stakeholders together around an agreed definition of best practice. ";"J. Walker

eldis:A12741;Extractive industries and sustainable development: an evaluation of World Bank Group experience (volume one: overview);;The World Bank Group (WBG) has the potential to improve the contribution of extractive industries (EI) to sustainable development and poverty reduction.  However, this report by the WBG’s operations evaluation departments finds that although its EI projects have produced positive economic and financial results, it has not been successful in ensuring compliance to environmental and social safeguards.  The paper examines the World Bank, the IFC and MIGA, to assess their performance in moving away from a focus on economic benefits towards sustainable development, addressing the governance challenges associated with resource-rich countries, and mitigating environmental and social costs of the extractive industry.The paper finds that the WBG has not devoted enough attention to the developmental needs of poorly performing resource-abundant countries, and can do much to improve its performance. In particular it recommends that the WBG should:Formulate an integrated strategy that starts with the presumption that successful projects should not only provide returns to investors but should also provide revenues for governments, mitigate negative environmental and social effects and benefit local communities. To this they mustformulate a WBG sector strategy: that encourages sustainable development and the reliable mitigation of adverse environmental and social impacts. The WBG should not support sector expansion unless it can mitigate these risksaddress EI in Country Assistance Strategies (CAS): CAS should explicitly discuss the sector’s current and potential economy-wide linkages in order to guide future project design, facilitate monitoring and evaluation and provide a framework for WBG-wide coordination and collaboration in the sectorpromote governance improvements: by devoting greater management attention and administrative budget for advisory and analytical activities aimed at improving the policy, institutional, and governance framework for EI for resource-rich countries with weak macro and sectoral governancesupport private sector development and environmental sustainability: by continuing to support closure of uneconomic mines, reform and privatise state-owned enterprises, and mitigate pre-existing environmental and social problemsStrengthen project implementation: rigorous implementation of safeguard policies by the WBG is a minimum requirement for it to operate sustainably. The WBG needs to more systematically define, monitor, document, and report on the economic, social and environmental impacts of its projects.  Specifically, the distribution of benefits needs to be explicitly monitored and evaluated:improve project screening and monitoring: by providing clear and consistent guidance for categorising projects, identifying applicable safeguards, the appropriate scope and nature of instruments, and reporting and evaluation of safeguards implementationinvolve specialists throughout: by providing adequate resources and incentives for the participation of qualified environmental and social specialists at the preparation, appraisal and supervision of all projects likely to have adverse impactsenhance reporting of results: by strengthening reporting of its results by ensuring that project completion reports includeex posteconomic rate of return or net present valueevaluate the sharing of benefits: by estimating the distribution of project benefits among different stakeholder groups (government, private companies, local communities), the acceptability of benefit sharing should be discussed with key stakeholder groupsEngage with stakeholders:the WBG has played an important convening role bringing different stakeholders together, but it has inadequately addressed some areas – notably governance and revenue management.  The WBG’s performance in these areas can be enhanced through improved consultation with stakeholders (including local communities) and by systematically and transparently reporting on key sustainability indicatorsupdate policy framework: by consulting with stakeholders to periodically adjust the policy framework to reflect evolving industry practice and to address identified gaps such as those related to consultation and disclosure, community development, social issues of mine closure, security, hazardous materials management and gas flaring. It should also recognise the expanding awareness of the human rights dimensions of WBGs policiespromote disclosure of fiscal revenues from EI: by vigorously pursuing country- and industry- wide disclosure of government revenues from EI. The Bank should work toward and support disclosure of EI revenues and their use in resource-rich countries.  The IFC and MIGA should also consider requiring their private sector clients to publish their payments to governmentsdevelop and monitor sustainability indicators: by consulting with stakeholders to develop indicators of economic, social and environmental sustainability, establish baseline data, provide adequate monitoring, and report and evaluate the results during supervision and in project completion reports.  The WBG should encourage independent outside monitoring, ideally using local capacityincrease local community participation: throughout the life cycle of EI-projects. The WBG should assist countries to increase community involvement in EI decision-making processes, and ongoing consultation throughout the project life cycle, including closure ;;;Operations Evaluations Division, World Bank;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"development;extractive industries;sustainable development";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12741;http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/24cc3bb1f94ae11c85256808006a0046/fb2a79b1eb4b9a4d85256d7a00750357/$FILE/Extractive_Industries_Evaluation_Overview.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flnweb18.worldbank.org%2Foed%2Foeddoclib.nsf%2F24cc3bb1f94ae11c85256808006a0046%2Ffb2a79b1eb4b9a4d85256d7a00750357%2F%24FILE%2FExtractive_Industries_Evaluation_Overview.pdf;;;;"MIGA;Corporate Social Responsibility;social impact;Extractive industries;sustainable development;evaluation;Finance policy;environmental impact;International Financial Institutions;extractive industries;ifc;World Bank;IFIs World Bank and IMF"

eldis:A73983;Transboundary water governance and climate change adaptation;;"As climate variability increases, so does the cost of the infrastructure, information and systems needed to cope with it. The biggest impact of climate change in many sectors may well be an increase in the cost of water services.

In addition, approaches to water resource management have evolved over the past few decades following the acknowledgment that engineering solutions, while vitally important and an integral part of any future approach, cannot by themselves solve the world’s water problems.

The most important factors to be considered for climate change adaptation in the water context relate to a range of social, economic and political challenges that have to be addressed, and a variety of ‘soft’, legal and institutional instruments that can be deployed to complement infrastructural solutions.

Experiences from river basins around the world provide numerous examples of ways in which the measures described in this report have been adopted and implemented.

Addressing these complex and often interrelated challenges requires consideration of a whole host of social, cultural, economic, environmental, legal and political factors.

However, for the purposes of this report, only the governance-related aspects have been considered. While these governance-related aspects are crucial to the development of climate change adaptation measures, they should, the authors maintain, not be considered in isolation. The main governance aspects they take into consideration are the following:


	Adopting ecosystem-based approaches to water management strategies.
	Strengthening institutions in order to facilitate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation.
	Coherent legal and regulatory frameworks.
	Investment in water governance capacity is critical

eldis:A24672;Can payments for avoided deforestation to tackle climate change also benefit the poor?;;Avoided deforestation (AD) has become a global concern with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper discusses financial incentive schemes to reduce rates of deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries may be established and considers some of the issues from the perspective of host countries and the forest-dependent poor. The authors derive a number of policy conclusions including:there are arguments that favour the inclusion of incentives for AD within the climate change conventionany scheme must be flexible enough to address the multiple origins of deforestation (economic, socio-political, demographic and environmental)national policies and processes need to be strengthened to address the root causes of deforestationdonor funding is required to help establish systems for transferring payments from international funds to individuals on the groundinternational oversight mechanisms need set standards for, and monitor the social impact of, avoided deforestation policies. These mechanisms simultaneously need to maintain host nation sovereigntyavoided deforestation might be incentives at the local level, by combining policy interventions and financial incentivesup-front funding will need to be provided to host countries to develop national systems for monitoring and accountingpro-poor appraisal is necessary from the inception stage. ;"L.

eldis:A42987;Whose forest tenure reform is it? Lessons from case studies in Vietnam;;"In Vietnam, forest area under the management of local people has expanded from almost nothing in the early 1990s to nearly 3.5 million hectares (27% of the national forest area) in 2006. This study looks at the extent to which such tenure reform has worked in practice and how it has affected local people’s livelihoods and well being. The study finds that: 
the best quality forests are still owned by state actors while non-state actors, particularly local people, have mostly been allocated poorer and degraded forestsfor forest resources already allocated to local people, legal permission from state authorities is still required for timber logging and use of forestland for cultivation the property rights provided for under the forestry law are not included in theforest land use titles that are agreed with local people production of high value forest products requires significant investment of capital and labour resources, two inputs which poor households generally lackin some communities, there has been no interruption of sustainable forest management practices that worked in the past .

Based on these findings, the study makes some recommendations, some of which are given below. 
In practice, the allocation of forest tenure rights to local people has not resulted in communities gaining actual control over local forests. For people to take meaningful control, power for management decisions must transferred by the state. Lack of clarity in the policy framework, slow responses by authorities to remedy mistakes, and local people’s limited knowledge of their rights and how to protect them have all undermined forest tenure reform. Local people should therefore be provided with appropriate legal education. The impact of forest tenure reform on poverty alleviation is unclear. Forest tenure reform should be made more pro-poor. This should include allocation of better quality forest to the local people, the design of mechanisms for equitable distribution of forest resources among recipients, and the provision of pro-poor capacity building and extension support. Local forest management traditions have endured in spite of decades of state control. With appropriate support, communities can build on these traditions and organize themselves to sustainably manage forests.Local customs should be respected. This could include improving state policies so that they are flexible in accounting for local variation of customs and culture and educating local state officials that scientific forestry is not the only way to manage forests.

eldis:A28250;Displacement, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Reparation and Development [as a result of dams];;"Reviews recent practices relating to displacement, resettlement, rehabilitation and development of people negatively affected by the construction of dams, in order to locate  the global experiences in dam induced displacement and understand the socio-political context of displacement and resettlement. Further, the assessment focuses on how legal and regulatory instruments facilitating displacement and involuntary resettlement have performed in safeguarding the rights of affected people. This review then identifies the essential principles of good practices that would constitute a 'successful', displacement, resettlement, rehabilitation and development program. A framework to facilitate a process of negotiation between State and the displaced people and legal instruments and remedial action necessary to ensure accountability on part of governments and facilitating agencies for accomplishing negotiated resettlement goals are presented.Key findings include:Generally, displacement as a result of acquisition is legally sanctioned while there is no legal framework that governs the process of displacement itself: the land acquisition law protects the sanctity of what causes displacement (i.e., the dam) but not the displaced. In the absence of legal safeguards to ensure accountability on the part of the State, resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) entitlements promised often by executive order have rarely been implemented in its entirety covering all affected peopleFor the dams funded by multilateral development institutions the nature and extent of compliance of 'mutually' agreed criteria and guidelines have been mixed. Frequently, monitoring missions were either inconsistent in their appraisal of compliance standards or accepted undue delays and deviationsA theme common in almost all countries is that funds for R&R program were inadequateThe concept of programming resettlement as development programme mode is gaining currency though practice is limited. ‘Good practices’ in this respect are those that (a) focus on means of livelihood rather than on assets; (b) assume an inclusive relationship between people and assets; and (c) admit of a negotiated definition of ‘just’ compensation. The record indicates that in those cases in which compensation packages were negotiated with PAPs and other stakeholders, the process has resulted in better outcomes for the resettlement process as a whole. Even when, for whatever reason, the negotiated form of compensation proves not to be the most appropriate or effective option, PAPs tend to feel more satisfied, as a result of the negotiation process, as attested by the Zimapan resettlement program in Mexico.There is an inverse relationship between scale of displacement and extent of achieving successful resettlement outcomes even in countries with best policy, institutional capacity and political commitment to do proper resettlement. There are a few good examples of minimising displacementGenerally, participation of the affected people has been superficial or treated as unimportant by those responsible for the project. Real participation implies the capacity to influence or even modify decisions. Good practices from Brazil, Canada and other countries offer significant learning value for the WCD have emerged from the case studies and submission to the WCDIn several countries, the indigenous and tribal peoples displaced by large dams seem to have experienced higher level of landlessness, unemployment, indebtedness and hunger. The studies have also documented adverse impact of displacement on women and children. Only situations where loss of land and access to natural resources were replaced with sustainable resources women had opportunities to recover their social and economic worth and respect.Some of the specific dominant themes emerging from displacement literature are:The displaced and affected people rarely received complete and authentic information on the dam project, nature and extent of displacement and other negative impacts, and R&R provisionsAbsence of baseline surveys, inability to determine number of people displaced and affected. The displaced and affected people normally did not have any role in generation of baseline information, development of resettlement plans or its implementation and monitoring. Traumatic forced and delayed relocation; denial of development opportunity for years, and often decades due to long displacement processProblems (related to infrastructure, relationship with host communities, etc.) in resettlement sites Loss of livelihood of people living in downstream not properly assessed and compensated.Concludes that a ‘successful’ resettlement with development is a fundamental commitment and responsibility of the State. No development project can result in complete alienation of the rights, customary and legal, of people through payment of a one-time compensation or facilitated relocation. On the contrary the process must result in the creation of new rights that will render people direct beneficiaries of the development project. Just as displacement is not an inevitable consequence of infrastructure development resettlement need not necessarily result in impoverishment. Central to positive resettlement and rehabilitation will be the empowering of people particularly the economically and socially marginalised as a result of both the process and outcomes of resettlement with development.

eldis:A19657;Corporate Social Responsibility in mining in Southern Africa: fair accountability or just greenwash?;;Based on case studies of mining in South Africa and Zambia, this article assesses CSR practices with accountability and fairness as key criteria.Main findings and conclusions of the report are:CSR is an increasingly prominent discourse also in southern Africa, particularly among mining companies due to mining’s potentially significant negative social and environmental impacts as well as inherent finiteness of the resource bodyaccountability - the emphasis on identifying and mitigating the impacts of core business practices - and fairness - the emphasis on helping the most vulnerable - are key criteria for any assessment of CSR policies and practicesthere are still important gaps between mining companies’ CSR activities, on the one hand, and accountability and fairness, on the otherin contrast to the business case argument for CSR, critical perspectives argue that CSR is primarily about greenwash, or the projection of a caring image without significant change to socially or environmentally harmful business practicesin South Africa, core business practices framed by the country’s colonial and apartheid history have been relatively resistant to socially motivated change, despite the increasing prominence of CSR policies and reportson the Zambian Copperbelt, CSR activities have played primarily an ameliorative role in the context of significant social disruption and uncertainty in the wake of privatisation.The article concludes that companies’ CSR-related claims, and particularly the reference to a business case for voluntary CSR, need to be treated with caution. However, CSR is not necessarily only greenwash. There are exceptions to the general trends considered above, and furthermore many of the CSR-related activities mentioned do represent important development contributions. ;"R. Hamann

eldis:A16545;Forests and floods: drowning in fiction or thriving on facts?;;"This new report from FAO and CIFOR challenges the conventional wisdom linking large-scale flooding to deforestation. The report acknowledges that forests can play a role in minimising runoff that causes localised flooding. But it concludes that there is no evidence that a loss of trees significantly contributes to severe widespread flooding. Even at the local level, the report notes, the flood-reducing effects of forests are heavily dependent on soil depth and structure, and saturation levels, not exclusively on the presence of the trees. Instead the authors believe that the sharp increase in the economic and human losses attributed to flooding is caused not by deforestation but mainly by the simple fact that more people are living and working in flood plains. As a result, many floods that previously would have been only minor events now become major disasters.The authors go on to claim that there can be a political interest in leaving the conventional wisdom about forests and floods unchallenged. For example, they say, it allows governments to simply respond with logging bans and give the appearance to the public they are taking decisive steps to stop flooding. The practical effect of such policies is to force poor farmers—who are routinely portrayed as major perpetrators of ""illegal logging""— to abandon their lands. They give as examples the catastrophic floods in China, Thailand and the Philippines which prompted logging bans that put millions of people out of work. Furthermore international agencies may also have a stake in maintaining the forest-flood ""myth"", according to the report, as it helps in ""channelling aid funds to upland reforestation projects.""The FAO and CIFOR state that it is time for national and international policy makers and development agencies to acknowledge that objective scientific research does not provide easy answers when it comes to understanding flooding. Instead, they point to a complex interplay of natural and man-made conditions that produce major floods and exacerbate their impact. For example, the report notes that large floods always have been a natural—and beneficial—part of the ecosystem. But a range of human activities, such as draining and developing wetlands and damming and altering stream flows, can make them worse. They call for an integrated approach which recognises the limitations of working only in the uplands to minimise floods or only in the lowlands to reduce their damage. Such an approach combines land-use management in the uplands with land-use planning, engineering measures, flood preparedness and emergency management in the lowlands. Crucially, they say, it considers the social and economic needs of communities living in both the mountainous watersheds and the river basins.

eldis:A26924;Staking Their Claims:  Land Disputes in Southern Mozambique;;Conflicting interests in land and resource use emerged in postwar Mozambique, giving rise to multiple layers of dispute. This article explores the disputes occurring between 1992 and 1995 in two districts which are notable for the severity of competition over land by virtue of their proximity to Maputo, namely, Matutuíne and Namaacha. Although private sector claims were beginning to be staked with the potential for displacing people occupying the same land, other conflicts still predominated. Some accompanied the contradictory, complex, and unstable peacetime population movements—people were dispersing into areas abandoned during the war, leaving overcrowded government wartime accommodation centers, and returning from neighboring countries. But, at the same time, insecurity and competition over land contributed to a new process of settlement concentration. In the context of severe drought, high unemployment, and contracting opportunity in South Africa, unemployed labor migrants, urban youth, and demobilized soldiers were attracted to the burgeoning and largely unregulated trades of charcoal-burning, fishing, hunting, and palm-wine tapping. These immigrants came into conflict with returning locals in bitter clashes which often focused primarily on trees, fish, and game rather than on land per se. Attempts to regulate resource exploitation were constrained by the inadequacy and corruptibility of fiscal controls, by armed groups, and by the crisis of authority at local level which characterized both government- and Renamo-administered areas.

eldis:A67310;Resource abundance in mozambique: avoiding conflict, ensuring prosperity;;"From as early as the 1960s companies have been exploring the natural resource wealth of Mozambique. However, it is only in the past decade that the potential of these resources has been realised. Indeed, Mozambique is now thought to have some of the largest deposits of gas and coal on the African continent, and beyond. The country is also one of Africa’s few post-conflict success stories and has experienced unprecedented positive economic growth since 1994, exceeding the growth of many of its peers across the continent. However, there are a number of very real concerns about how successfully the government will be able to govern its mineral resources. This is particularly relevant in the light of renewed political tensions between the Frelimo-led government and the official opposition, Renamo, that have been on the rise since early 2013.

This paper investigates the likelihood of violence as a result of natural resource abundance in the country. Specifically, by combining general typologies of conflict and more specific theories on natural resource abundance and conflict, this paper identifies six risk factors for conflict in Mozambique: its history of violence and political party dynamics; geographic distribution; poverty and inequality; expectations; corruption; and the cost of extraction.

In order to avoid conflict and ensure broad-based prosperity for the Mozambican population as a whole, the government will have to navigate carefully several complex issues in the governance of its natural resources. This paper examines these factors against the likelihood of violence and concludes that although there is a high likelihood of the emergence of pockets of violence, there are various efforts the government can make to avoid negative outcomes associated with the country’s resource abundance. Indeed, the task of translating its newfound mineral wealth into the development of the country itself while balancing local expectations and political tensions is a very large one that will require the establishment of clear and strong policies, institutions, legislation and regulatory frameworks.

eldis:A28813;Good practices in drylands management;;"The objectives of this study are to analyze and synthesize the experience of the World Bank and other agencies in dryland management, with special emphasis on Africa.Recommendations are provided on ""good policies and practices"" in drylands management, which can support actions to fulfil obligations arising from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) for member countries and for international organizations, such as the World Bank. The paper focuses primarily on ""good practice"" related to the management of rangelands and dryland farming, and on drought preparedness.Conclusions:The understanding of desertification has undergone major changes over the last two decades. The problem is now seen more as one of reduction in land productivity in the drylands, rather than of productive land turning into desertsCloser studies of long-term landscape changes, of rangeland ecology, of community natural resource management regimes, and of agricultural intensification processes reveal many cases where the resource management practices adopted by the people living in an area have unjustly been seen as degrading the landThere is a need to understand drylands change and management in a local and site-specific context. There is a heterogeneity or variety of causes and consequences of environmental change. These differences effect agricultural development potentials, extension and research strategies, and natural resources management. Each country and region requires a different strategyStrategies to improve drylands management must build on a greater appreciation of the skills with which drylands people allocate resources and use opportunities, and of the constraints they face. Interventions by governments and donors must utilize the knowledge of local people, and be based on their views of what is appropriateResource management should be more participatory. However devolving power to local communities is not free from problems. Communties are usually heterogeneous groups, prone to be dominated by local elites. Delineation of landscape can cause disputes over border issues or shared resourcesDrought preparedness should be a primary concernEfforts to reduce dryland degradation require intensification in agriculture, translated as more efficient use of land, labor and capital, related to technological,  institutional and policy innovationsThe basic preconditions for improved drylands management are government concern, political will, and commitment. Focusing more attention on how government commitment is created and sustained - the political economy of drylands management - is therefore important. [authors] ";"R. Oygard

eldis:A65590;"Lineage and land reforms in Malawi: do matrilineal and patrilineal landholding systems represent a problem for land reforms in Malawi?""";;"This paper is about land tenure relations among the matrilineal and patrilineal cultures in Malawi. Data from the National Agricultural and Livestock Census are used to characterize marriage systems and settlement and landholding patterns for local communities. Marriage systems correspond to customary land tenure patterns of matrilineal or patrilineal land holding. The differences between the two major ways of land holding represent a particular challenge for land reforms intending to unify rules for land tenure and land devolution.

The paper discusses the problems of formalisation and the idea of maintaining the diversity. If diversity is not respected there is a chance that some sections of society, especially communities with matrilineal land holding, might be victims of formalization. Based on analogy of the resilience of the patrilineal land holding system in Norway it is argued that a democratic system will have difficulty removing the preferential rights of linage members and it is recommended that the existing land rights are formally recognized and circumscribed by fair procedures.

In a situation of diversity one goal of a well-designed land holding system should be to ease the transitions of the diverse customary tenure systems towards systems adapted to the requirements of a modern large scale society rather than to a unified national system.

eldis:A67702;Improved land management in the Lake Victoria basin: annual technical report July 2001 to June 2002;;"This report addresses the challenges of land management in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. In 1999 the World Agroforestry Centre launched a major effort to identify, diagnose and reverse degradation in the Lake Victoria basin, focusing primarily on the Kenyan part of the basin. Dubbed “TransVic,” this project was supported by a number of donor agencies and collaborators, with particularly strong support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Field activities in the Kenyan part of the basin were undertaken with Kenya’s National Agriculture and Livestock Extension Programme. This report summarizes the major achievements of TransVic from 1999 to the end of 2004. The project greatly improved understanding of land degradation processes, costs and hotspots, the linkages between poverty, degradation and water resource management, and the possibilities for and constraints to solving those problems through various technical and institutional approaches. The research and development agenda for the region is now able to concentrate on the investments in land and water resources that can curtail degradation and help restore these degraded resources.

eldis:A65594;Large-scale land acquisition in Africa ;;" Large-scale land investment is not a new phenomenon in Africa, but the speed and scale at which it is occurring today makes it one of the most pressing issues on the continent. These land investments are promoted by advocates as “win-win” solutions - benefiting national economies, rural development and ensuring food security at the same time. Critics on the other hand view large-scale land acquisitions as “land grabbing”, a process that undermines local land rights and that disproportionately affects the socially and economically vulnerable who bear the bulk of the costs while reaping few of the benefits of the transactions.

This fact sheet has been produced by GRID-Arendal in collaboration with partners to highlight some of the key aspects of large-scale land investments in Africa.

eldis:A100796;Review of the projected impacts of climate change on coastal fishes in southern Africa ;;The coastal zone represents one of the most economically and ecologically important ecosys- tems on the planet, none more so than in southern Africa. This manuscript examines the potential impacts of climate change on the coastal fishes in southern Africa and provides some of the first information for the Southern Hemisphere, outside of Australasia. It begins by describing the coastal zone in terms of its physical characteristics, climate, fish biodiversity and fisheries. The region is divided into seven biogeographical zones based on previous descriptions and interpretations by the authors. A global review of the impacts of climate change on coastal zones is then applied to make qualitative predictions on the likely impacts of climate change on migratory, resident, estuarine-dependent and catadro- mous fishes in each of these biogeographical zones.In many respects the southern African region represents a microcosm of climate change variability and of coastal habitats. Based on the broad range of climate change impacts and life history styles of coastal fishes, the predicted impacts on fishes will be diverse. The authors state that this review reveals that there is lack of fundamental knowledge in this field, in particular in southern Africa. Several research priorities, including the need for process-based fundamental research programs are highlighted. ;"W.M. Potts

eldis:A38550;Water democracy: reclaiming public water in Asia;;"Water crisis is largely a problem of governance. While there is an obvious bias towards privatisation as a solution to the water sector problems, the last few years have also seen many social mobilisations, consolidation of forces, and hard-won battles for peoples and communities’ water struggles, particularly in defending water as a human right.This collection of 19 essays by civil society activists, trade unionists and other water practitioners, give an overview of these developments in the water sector by presenting examples of both struggles against water privatisation and people-centred public water management from across Asia.The papers show that

    the ideology-driven privatization wave has now also reached Asian countries where public water delivery has been very successful. 
    in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan, where public utilities have largely achieved water for all, the governments are planning to boost the role of the private sector. 
    in Malaysia, the process of widespread privatisation has already led to predictable problems such as increased tariff
    in India, Cambodia, Indonesia and many other Asian countries where large parts of the population have for far too long remained without adequate access to water and sanitation, concrete, workable alternatives to water privatisation do exist.
    public water solutions are being developed and implemented in numerous Asian countries, i.e. progressive public water management models, often involving new forms of local cooperation between public water operators, communities, trade unions and other key groups.
    experiences in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala show that empowerment of communities and the democratisation of governance are strong positive tools for improving public water supply
    an important new trend is the emergence of public-public partnerships (PUPs), in which a well performing water operator assists a utility in need of support. Examples include PUPs in Indonesia and Cambodia

The overall conclusion is that although numerous public water utilities in large parts of Asia fail to supply safe water for all, privatisation is not the answer. The papers here show that there is no lack of workable public service reform approaches that could dramatically improve access to water supply and sanitation for people across the continent, if the political will is there.

eldis:A73770;By the gun or by the bribe: Firm size, environmental governance and corruption among mining companies in Guatemala;;"This U4 Issue discusses the corruption risks faced by mining companies in Guatemala, with a particular focus on the risks faced by small, “junior” mining companies primarily engaged in exploration. Several factors make such companies highly prone to engaging in corrupt behavior, especially when operating in weak institutional contexts: the highly competitive nature of the mining industry, the risky dynamics of the exploration stage, and the specific characteristics of junior companies – their short operational timelines, low reputational risks, highly mobile and flexible nature, and reliance on fickle venture capital. Additionally, public environmental governance, and in particularly the approval of the environmental impact assessment, represents a moment of acute vulnerability to corruption, particularly for junior companies. In order to mitigate corruption risks among junior mining companies, donor agencies should help to build community capacity to monitor mining operations, build central state government capacity for environmental governance, work with countries to improve the rigor for environmental impact assessment processes, increase the visibility and reputational risks for junior companies, and build cultures of compliance in junior companies’ countries of origin as well as within companies.

eldis:A56473;African range wars: climate, conflict, and property rights;;"This paper examines the effect of climate change on pastoralist conflict in Africa. The rangelands of East Africa is particularly vulnerable to drought, which is associated with climate change. In this respect, the paper focuses its analysis on changes in resource availability contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The authors clarify that the role of resources is further contextualised by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. They argue that any analysis of climate change and conflict needs to account for property rights protection and even more importantly the bias in these property rights. The document makes the following findings:

    pastoralist conflicts are typically fought over water rights or grazing rights to unfenced land 
    the state is rarely involved directly and is playing limited role in establishing, protecting and recognising property rights in Africa’s rangelands
    violence between pastoral groups should be understood as more than just resource conflicts
    conflict is generally increasing with resource abundance contingent on property rights bias
    if a relationship between ecological degradation and armed conflict exists, it should be strongly evident in the form of inter-communal or ethnic violence.

eldis:A11847;Water management conflict and the challenges of globalisation notes;;As globalisation intensifies, what is the impact on the power of national governments to address water issues? The author notes how globalisation has reconfigured the state and its power vis-à-vis water in a number of ways:the state's territory is increasingly becoming part of a borderless world, water as a transborder issue redefines geography, community and powerstate sovereignty on water is increasingly eroded, new international rules and authorities govern water issuesstate autonomy on water issues is compromised, the state cannot act alone on water issues anymore, it has to consult with a number of various other actorsthe question of citizens' allegiance towards the state is challenge, new centres of public authority are created outside the state's jurisdiction and citizens are more likely to align themselves with a transnational social movement on a particular issuethe world is not anarchic, but rather a heterarchy, a system in which political authority is shared and divided between different layers of governance and in which various actors share in governingThis paper examines the globalisation of water issues, which relate to basic human needs and human health, food security, ecosystems, and national security. It addresses a number of emergent patterns in this process, including:the retreat of the statethe growth of transborder linksthe development and expansion of international lawincreased private sector involvement in global and national water regulation and managementthe spread of global social movements addressing water issuesthe increase in the number of global governance agencies involved in this fieldthe formulation of globally shared values with regard to waterThe paper concludes that, as the development and resource gap between developed and developing countries widen, an increase in the divergence between these economies is evident. The author claims that the answer does not lie in increasing the number of bigger water supply schemes, but in sharing water values on a global scale.States are increasingly dependent upon other state and non-state actors to ensure adequate quality and quantities of water. The emergence of an evolving global policy on water issues to address transborder water issues constitutes an emergent system of global governance reflecting increased political co-ordination among governments, intergovernmental organisations and transnational social movements. ;J-A.

eldis:A71497;The overlooked role of elites in African grassroots conflicts: A case study of the Dinka-Mundari-Bari conflict in Southern Sudan;;"Many analysts of grassroots conflicts in African emphasized one of the following factors to be the most important: ethnic divisions, competition over resources or competition between pastoralists and agriculturalists. The role of elites has been down played in such conflicts. This argument is being challenged by current evidence as shown by the Dinka-Mundari-Bari Conflict in Juba County in Southern Sudan. The data for this paper is derived mainly from a longitudinal study dating back to 1972 using observation and interviews as the main methods of data collection. Other sources of data included historical and recent reports of conflicts in the area. The major findings of the study are that: While low-keyed conflicts between the Dinka-Bor and the Bari-Speaking group existed in the past over the ownership and use of natural resources, they have been transformed into violent political conflicts over the years. The fragmentation of centers of political power, the divide-and-rule strategy of the Central Government, and the divisions between the elites of the two ethnic groups, who weakened local administrative structures and traditional mechanisms in conflict management and resolution, have sharpened the ethnic differences and competition over resources. The manipulation of ethnic differences by opposing groups in the various civil wars in Sudan and by the elites at the centers of political power is the main cause of transforming traditional competition over natural resources into violent conflicts.

eldis:A41269;Conserving land, protecting water;;"Following from the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture project, this book examines the relationships and linkages between land use and water management and social systems. Given that agriculture is the largest economic sector in many developing countries, this volume provides innovative ideas for the prevention of land degradation and for improving the sustainability of food production in the developing world. It focuses on positive examples of sustainable use of natural resources and is aimed at the non-specialist scientist.Some of the key issues discussed by the authors include:

    the status of the world’s ecosystems with respect to land and water resources and global patterns of land and water degradation
    improved management options at different scales - both through theoretical contexts and practical case studies 
    what were the driving forces and necessary conditions for the case studies presented to be successful?

A number of conclusions noted demonstrate that:

    improved land management can be good for both agricultural livelihoods and water resources simultaneously
    mitigation of land degradation can result in significant increases in water productivity, and this can be achieved using existing technologies and approaches
    positive results cannot occur without an understanding the socio-political contexts of the area. 

Some of the main recommendations highlight the need for: 

    policy and local level interventions that can stimulate resource-conserving agriculture that improves land and water productivity and works with long term ecosystem sustainability thinking
    the understanding of land use at the landscape level and managing these as a suite of potential activities with ecosystems in common
    human societies to be recognised as integral components of these landscapes 
    taking the right steps now in agriculture water management as it will significantly reduce poor people’s vulnerability to climate change by reducing water-related risks.

eldis:A73079;Mining value chains and green growth in South Africa: A conflictual but intertwined relationship;;"The development of mining value chains is conflictual but deeply intertwined with the goal of sustainable development.  The response of mining value chains to the shift to a green economy cannot be business-as-usual and requires a proactive answer by business, Government, labour, non-governmental organisations and the research community in support of sustainable development. The transition to a green economy will not fundamentally challenge the central position of mining value chains in South Africa’s development path. The development of green industries and services will generate considerable mining-related opportunities, which South Africa is ideally placed to seize. The shift to a green economy will nevertheless structurally affect both the demand for mineral-based products, i.e. what to produce, and the means of providing them, i.e. how to produce. While many mining and manufacturing companies are already vigorously investing in the green economy, most prospects on both the supply and demand side remain underexploited or untapped.

This Working Paper builds on a research project on the impact of electricity price increases on the competitiveness of selected mining sector and smelting value chains in South Africa, carried out with the Global Green Growth Institute for the Economic Development Department and the Department of Trade and Industry of the Republic of South Africa.

Key policy recommendations:


	a comprehensive strategic and integrated planning for the sustainable development of South Africa’s natural resources should be developed
	institutional and legal confusion around environmental regulations should be addressed while environmental and social ‘licences to operate’ should be adequately enforced
	the use of renewable energy and cogeneration and the improvement of resource efficiency, particularly in the area of energy and water, should be accelerated and further supported
	the interplay between industrial development, trade and green economy in South Africa should be better understood, particularly in terms of potential risks and opportunities

eldis:A29928;Gender, pastoralism, and intensification: changing environmental resource use in Morocco;;Through a study of the sedentarization of the Beni Guil pastoral nomads of eastern Morocco,this paper examines how gender interacts with environmental and socio-economic change. This paper demonstrates how gendered resource exploitation (in particular,the collection of mushrooms,medicinal plants, and fuelwood) is recast through sedentarization,urbanization,and commercialization.The paper finds that:gender-based resource management patterns shift in response to settlement,commercialization,and more intensive land-use practicesmany household resource responsibilities such as collecting wild foods,medicinal plants and fuelwood are increasingly shared by women and men as households adapt to economic and environmental changes associated with sedentarizationcertain accepted theories of the consequences of settlement for nomad women and their local environments should be re-examined ;S.H.

eldis:A100899;Use of a shared river by urban and Peri-urban residents: water use conflicts and adaptation measures;;"Khulna, the third largest metropolitan city (46 km) of Bangladesh, is vulnerable to climate change and unplanned urbanization process. The city has been identified as one of the 15 most climate change vulnerable cities of the world. This study was conducted to assess how urban and peri-urban residents of Khulna have been affected by the Mayur River through its use and abuse, and to explore adaptation measures. To complete the study, primary data was collected through field surveys, stakeholders' consultation, focused group discussion, key informantinterview and water quality analysis. Result shows that the Mayur plays a very important role by meeting the agricultural water demand; domestic water demand and water demand for capture and culture of fisheries for livelihoods. However, urban residents use the river as a dumping site for discharging solid waste. River encroachment through various means and practices is also a regular event. Analysis of salinity and tidal water level indicates that salinity intrusion would further increase due to sea level rise induced by climate change. Water and wastewater quality reveals that the river water is extremely polluted to support aquatic life and livelihood services.Physico-chemical parameters, DO, EC, TDS, Na+, Mg2+, PO43- and salinity exceed the recommended limits for drinking and irrigation set by the DoE and WHO. These overall situations often initiate water use conflicts. Finally, we discussed the current water management practices and adaptation for long term management of the Mayur.

Using ethnographic and participatory approaches, it documents the people's lived experience of a changing climate and water insecurity. While urbanization and climate variability alter the availability of water, the effects of this are aggravated by a complex interaction of caste, class, gender and locational factors. The most vulnerable are those whose identities are constructed at the intersection of these factors. The paper then describes the wide range of social, economic and institutional factors that shape the periurban residents' adaptive strategies. ;"P. Ranjan

eldis:A73170;The nexus of oil, conflict, and climate change vulnerability of pastoral communities in Northwest Kenya;;"This paper focuses on pastoralism in the country of Turkana in northwest Kenya.

It highlights that an increase in drought frequency associated with global climate change and intensifying violent conflicts between pastoral groups, poses significant challenges for local communities. It points out that significant oil reserves have been discovered in the region which may compound the problem.

The paper aims to analyse how the oil exploration affects the communities’ vulnerability to climate change. Secondly, the paper explores the risk of 10 the oil explorations to create new conflicts or aggravate existing ones.

The findings are taken to suggest that the oil exploration increases the community’s vulnerability to climate change. Further, the paper argues, unmet community expectations for water, employment and development pose a significant risk for violent conflict between local communities and the operating oil company. Intercommunal conflict over water and 20 land could increase as well.

eldis:A31142;Urban and peri-urban aquaculture development in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India;;"This paper follows the 2005 Dhaka workshop on ""Peri-urban aquatic production and improvement of the livelihoods of the urban poor in south east Asia"". It aims to raise awareness and create dialogue amongst policy-makers and development practitioners concerning the nature, extent and potential of urban and peri-urban aquaculture in Bangladesh and West Bengal, in support of the Bengal Platform established at the workshop. The Bengal Platform works for information exchange and mutual support in the field of peri-urban aquatic production in south east Asia.The paper argues that urban and peri-urban aquaculture is locally important for income, livelihoods and food security and can contribute to enhanced wastewater management and environmental protection. The authors call for more information on the nature and extent of urban and peri-urban aquaculture to specify the importance of such production at district, state and national levels, and consequently its value in competing for scarce development resources.The authors argue that the establishment of the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Committee, constitutes a potentially important element of a planning framework for urban and peri-urban aquaculture development, where the needs and expectations of primary stakeholders in the wetlands can be incorporated in planning and decision-making. The committee has representatives from municipal authorities, government departments, producer associations and community-based organisations (CBOs) representing groups of people living and working in the wetlands. However, by adopting the Peri-Urban Participatory Action Planning and Implementation (PU-PAPi) approach in future development planning it is anticipated that the needs of the vulnerable people not directly represented on the committee will be clarified and addressed.

eldis:A23410;The global drylands imperative: pastoralism and mobility in the drylands;;"This document outlines the necessity of formulating development policies specifically targeted at pastoralists and their livelihoods.  The author reports that pastoralists have generally been ill-served by development policies and actions because of myths suggesting that pastoralists were 'backward'.  Previous policies focused on changing pastoralists into something more ‘modern' or progressive.  Fortunately, many of these policies are now changing and consider ways to flexibly develop policies that address the needs of pastoralists.Some of the myths and misunderstandings that informed previous development policies towards pastoralists include:nomadic pastoralism is an archaic form of production, whose time has passedmobility is inherently backward, unnecessary, chaotic and disruptivepastoralists do not take care of the land because of the 'tragedy of the commons'pastoralists contribute little to national economic activitypastoralism is a very low productive system. Sedentary cattle raising is more productive than mobile systemspastoralists need to settle to benefit from servicesThe authors suggest that a more realistic vision of future pastoralism envisages a flourishing economy, with well-educated and successful pastoral producers, no longer marginalised from mainstream society. In order to fulfil this, new policies need to address:the basic structure of the pastoral economy: a ranching model will not be successfulpastoral population growth: in many cases an overflow channel for herders who want to leave pastoralism is needed, so that pastoral populations can regain flexibility in relation to the natural resources that sustain them; also important is the diversification and processing or production of secondary products within pastoralist areasmanaging land use and natural resources to give priority to pastoralism where that is justifiedimproving natural resource tenure to remove present ambiguities and strengthen corporate
tenureimproving pastoral productivityproviding more efficient markets, and encouraging pastoralists to identify and produce for particular marketsproviding services including education and health, often through a mix of mobile and static

This section also look into: man's role in environmental degradation and the pastoral crisis; loss of traditional grazing lands and its effects; current drought policies in pastoral areasThe article concludes by making recommendations and considerations for the future. These inlcude:development of these lands must take a form more suitable to the sociological, political and ecological system to which these areas are best adaptedconventional range management techniques known to work elsewhere have had no success owing to unreliable and erratic rainfall with consequent irregular forage production. This means that in most cases it is not possible to devise a definite and regularly prescribed grazing rotationmany development plans are illsuited to peoples needs, and are therefore rejected. An example would be where development programmes emphasise cattle production in areas where camels and small stock are environmentally the best adapted speciesany developmental and environmental programme which seeks the welfare of the local pastoralists must first of all strengthen the present pastoral economy. Once the pastoral economy has been placed on a firmer and less vulnerable basis there is no reason why it cannot produce a surplus of livestock and meat for the wider economy as well as enriching the local communitydevelopment plans designed for marginal lands must also have provision for drought yearspastoralists should sell off stock rapidly when drought threatens.  his has two aspects. First, pastoralists should be encouraged to sell mature male stock in good years and to save money so earned in savings accounts (where such facilities are available) for use in drought years.

eldis:A20074;How Dutch public money is used to finance the oil industry;;"This report investigates how Dutch public money is being used to support oil production in developing countries through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs). It notes that the Dutch government contributes to MDBs in two ways: through financial contributions using public money and by voting on the boards of the banks.Three case studies demonstrate that recent oil projects financed by the Dutch government and MDBs are failing the poor. They are: the Chad- Cameroon Pipeline in West Africa; the Baku-T’bilisi-Ceyhan pipeline system in the South Caucasus and the Sakhalin-II Oil and Gas Project in far eastern Russia.. The report argues that if the Dutch government is to achieve its goals on development cooperation and on addressing climate change it must cease supporting oil projects in developing countries and support renewable and sustainable energy projects.The report covers the following areas:the development goals of International Financial Institutions and the west’s dependency on oilthe local, regional and global impacts of oil developmentcase studiesenergy securityopportunities for change It concludes:internal divisons within the Dutch government with regard to extractive industry policies need to be addressedthe Dutch Government  needs a clear policy on support for oil development, and on how this relates to climate change mitigationthe urgent problem of climate change and for a long-term national energy policy that encompasses the impact of oil dependence on developing countries and the global imperative for a clear strategy for moving towards alternatives to oilThe report recommends that:the Dutch Government should phase out over a limited timeframe, all public funding for the oil industryDutch participation in MDBs should be in

eldis:A23826;Policies and strategies to address the vulnerability of pastoralists in Sub-Saharan Africa;;This paper makes a case for increased policy attention to pastoralists in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The paper presents:estimates of the numbers of agro-/pastoral populations globallytheir livestock and their contribution to national economiesthe incidence of poverty among agro-/pastoral populations.The author examines the causes and dynamics of poverty among pastoral populations in Africa drawing on the sustainable livelihoods framework and focusing on vulnerability to shocks. Traditional livelihood and risk-management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective and pastoralists progressively more vulnerable to droughts, market exclusion, epidemics and violent conflicts, as well as being negatively affected by increasing human and livestock pressure on fragile drylands.The key policy question identified is whether it is preferable to invest in pastoral development or whether it is more appropriate to support exit- strategies for pastoralists. The report argues for a complementary strategy. On the one hand, pastoralism is the best, if not the only, means to make productive and sustainable use of natural resources in arid and semi-arid areas while on the other hand increasing human and livestock pressure on the drylands needs to be addressed by strategies that support adoption of alternative income generation activities by some agro-/pastoral people.The final part of the paper examines some policy options to sustain pastoral development. The main focus is on policies mitigating vulnerability of pastoral people to shocks. A review of policy responses by various countries in SSA shows some interesting and innovative approaches including:effective drought management policies and the adaptation of pastoral people to market opportunities in Kenyacost-effective policies in Chad which combine animal and human health service delivery to pastoral people in remote areasthe incorporation of specific pastoral livelihood and employment promotion issues into the national employment policy in Tanzania.The report urges decision-makers to continue experimenting and to refine and adapt policies to the specific features of the different pastoral situations. ;N.

eldis:A101578;South African banks footprint in SADC mining projects: environmental, social and governance principles;;Environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  concerns  are  an  increasingly  important  factor worldwide for banks when they invest in large projects. In the Southern African region with its rich mineral deposits, this trend has added importance. Mining companies extract minerals from the ground, and their activities routinely give rise to public concerns about the pollution of water sources, adequate land for agriculture, and fair community participation in mining projects. South African law accepts that the directors of corporations such as banks have fiduciary obligations to act in the best interests of shareholders.Given the importance of mining activity to economies in Southern Africa an important question aligned to this fiduciary duty is this: Are banks when conducting business obliged to act in the best interests of stakeholders affected by the activities of the mining companies they fund? The trite response is that banks have recognised their obligations to communities through their commitment to SRI (socially responsible investment) practices and internal ESG processes that ensure that their funding decisions result in no harm to communities.This paper sets out to critically consider the effectiveness of ESG principles implemented by South Africa’s banks when they fund mining projects in the SADC region. There are internal differences  in  ESG  principles  between  banks,  and  a  variety  of  funding  methods  to  which  the principles  are  applied. The study evaluates the ESG frameworks used by each bank and, given the significant market share, aggregates this information to present a picture of the effectiveness of  these  frameworks. The approach taken is a critical one, meaning that what is presented in bank annual reports and sustainability reports is not merely accepted, but (to the extent possible) internal ESG risk frameworks are interrogated for adequacy of application by banks when funding mining  projects. The effectiveness of the implementation of internal ESG  procedures  by banks is then measured against available evidence. This evidence includes the effects of mine project  funding  decisions  of  banks  on  ESG  categories  as  ascertained  from  public  information.  After consideration of the evidence, observations and conclusions are provided on the analysis. In the closing section, recommendations are provided on areas for possible focus to improve the effectiveness of ESG principles used by banks in the SADC region. ;M.

eldis:A40698;MEAs, conservation and conflict. A case study of Virunga National Park, DRC;;"Focusing on the case of Virunga National Park (PNVi) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this paper looks at Multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and the impact of ongoing conflict. It also discusses opportunities for elevating environment-conflict issues to international policy levels to help save important ecosystems in times of conflict. It is explained that for the past two decades, the park and the surrounding area in North Kivu province have experienced near-constant violent conflict. For the local population, the result has been widespread suffering: death, rape, displacement, sickness and starvation. Beyond the humanitarian crisis, conflict has threatened the species, habitats and communities that depend on PNVi for their survival. The park is in crisis: its governance system has collapsed; its boundaries are encroached upon by the surrounding local and refugee populations; its habitats are being destroyed by overfishing and charcoal production; and its animals are killed for meat and ivory. Multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), designed to protect such globally-significant ecosystems, have so far been unable to address the threats to the park. Despite the proliferation of relevant environmental conventions and the DRC’s participation in them, environmental destruction continues in PNVi. UN MEAs provide opportunities for elevating environment-conflict issues to international policy levels. Although UN MEAs are not designed or expected to offer practical solutions to conservation crises on the ground, they do build capacity, improve information gathering  and support underfunded budgets. Some of the UN MEAs being initiated in DRC include: 

    the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) - field consultations indicate that the CBD is not seen as a particularly strong tool for the promotion of transboundary cooperation. But improved action on transboundary natural resource management in the region, supported by the Convention, could help park authorities on all sides of the border deal with some of the impacts of conflict on the various components of the shared ecosystem 
    the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species has proven to be an important catalyst for deepening transboundary cooperation among the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. Key lessons include the importance of forging agreements at the level closest to the environment-conflict challenge in question and the need for robust cooperative mechanisms to address conservation challenges that no one range state could address alone
    the Wetlands Protection Convention could provide much-needed resources for the DRC in the protection of its Ramsar sites. Ramsar could be an important catalyst for strengthening transboundary cooperation in order to mitigate the environmental impacts of conflict in the region, specifically relating to the Lake Edward ecosystem.

The paper concludes by highlighting other international and African policy instruments and forums, which are equally important alongside the MEA-specific entry points. These provide immediate opportunities for the DRC to raise environmental conflict concerns. ";"A. Crawford

eldis:A26284;From Dutch disease to deforestation - a  macroeconomic link? A case study from Ecuador;;"In the literature about macroeconomics and deforestation, it is often supposed that strong foreign exchange outflows (e.g. debt service) increase deforestation, as higher poverty augments frontier migration and natural resources are squeezed to generate export revenues. This paper analyses the opposite phenomenon, i.e. the deforestation impact of  substantial foreign exchange inflows, which is analysed in the ""Dutch Disease"" macroeconomics literature. This framework is applied to Ecuador, which from 1974 to 1982 faced a foreign exchange boom from oil exports and foreign borrowing, and then compared to the somewhat scattered data on Ecuadorean deforestation. The results do not support the initial hypothesis of 'more foreign exchange - less deforestation'; it is more likely that deforestation increased during the boom. Oil production facilitated new colonization; road construction programmes heavily spurred deforestation; soaring     budgets of development agencies facilitated cattle expansion. Factors that worked in the opposite direction (such as higher rural-urban migration, competitiveness loss in
land-extensive agriculture, and more money available for forest conservation) were insufficient to reverse the picture. As an overall conclusion, the Ecuadorean case reveals a complexity of links from macroeconomics to sectoral growth and deforestation, in particular because of the catalytical role of economic policies: With the Ecuadorean state's explicit strategy of infrastructural and agricultural expansion financed by oil revenues, the boom could not possibly lead to reduced deforestation. This implies that no      easy conclusions can be drawn from the external and macroeconomic framework to deforestation: Much depends on the specific sectoral structure and on domestic policy responses.

eldis:A100694;The impact of climate change, desertification and land degradation on the development prospects of landlocked developing countries;;"Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) are disadvantaged in a myriad of ways and they have special needs which require special attention. Challenges such as undiversified economies, vulnerability to climate change and climate variability, land degradation and desertification, among others, are undermining the economic potential of many LLDCs. This has been exacerbated by weak export base of many LLDCs centered on a few primary agricultural and/ or mineral commodities. Further, because of their physical location markedly characterized by lack of access to sea ports, LLDCs are popularly referred to as ""€œprisoners of geography""€. This leaves most LLDCs at a distinct disadvantage as they cannot compete in international trade markets. Added together, this has created a situation in which LLDCs are among the poorest of the poor. In order to address this specific challenge, the United Nations First International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Development Partners held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in 2003, adopted the Almaty Programme of Action (APoA) whose central thrust was to: Address the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries.This comprehensive global partnership programme was intended to address essential transit transport problems and facilitate trade for LLDCs. Under the resolution 66/214 of the United Nations General Assembly, a ten-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action was undertaken in November 2014 to take stock on the performance of LLDCs over the past decade and adopted the Vienna Programme of Action (VPoA). One lesson learnt during the implementation of the APoA is that gains and momentum made by the LLDCs can be subdued unless threats posed by climate change, land degradation and desertification are seriously addressed.This study, therefore, seeks to draw the attention of the international community, policy makers and development agencies to the severe impact that climate change, desertification and land degradation has on the economies of LLDCs. Despite their huge negative impact on LLDCs, these issues have not received the international attention and priority they deserve. This study seeks to identify LLDC's priority areas on climate change, land degradation and desertification that could be included in their new development agenda. In order to achieve this objective, the study: (a) provides a comprehensive review of the impact of climate change, desertification and land degradation on LLDCs, (b) reviews national, regional and international interventions which have been implemented in LLDCs; (c) identifies best practices, lessons learnt and emerging opportunities and (d) proffers recommendations for inclusion in a new development agenda for LLDCs which will assist them to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change, desertification and land degradation.Recommendations on priorities of LLDCs on climate change, desertification, land degradation and drought - what has emerged from this study is that there is an imperative need to give LLDCs special attention in as far as the issues of climate change, land degradation and desertification are concerned. Although these issues have generally attracted considerable attention of the global community, there is no special focus on LLDCs, yet these countries are among the worst affected. Based on this review, a number of lessons, priorities and recommendations are drawn which can help shape further policy debates and concrete future plans of action. It is important to build the resilience of LLDCs to withstand the impact; build their adaptive capacity; and mitigation capacity.

eldis:A46116;Can river communities benefit from resettlement?;;"The forced resettlement of river basin communities because of dam construction is a highly controversial process. It can be justified only if plans are implemented to enable resettlers to raise their living standards. They should be involved in all stages of project decision-making including project identification and, if a dam is selected, in project planning, implementation and monitoring.In the past,
people could express their concerns about dams and resettlement schemes to
project authorities, but this rarely had much impact. Today, the preferred
approach is partnerships with local people to involve them in all aspects of
resettlement, preferably as project shareholders and co-project managers.
Independent
research reviews recent trends of forced resettlement. Dam construction projects
can benefit local people by sharing the financial gains of a project, considering
local culture to enable more appropriate selection of sites, and assisting the
resettlement process. The research includes the rights of indigenous
communities who have often been subject to cultural discrimination during
resettlement planning and have not had any influence on resettlement policies.
There are
significant cultural, political and economic barriers to successful
resettlement schemes. The research shows:

The increasing diversity of
communities makes it difficult to ensure that everyone has opportunity to
participate in discussions and planning.
Project developers often overlook
cultural factors, such as traditional work activities and belief systems.
Promoting economic development and
improving living standards following resettlement are usually the most
difficult tasks.
An irrigation scheme included in dam
projects can be important for improving the living standards of resettled
populations and other nearby communities. It should be planned to achieve
multiplier effects that will provide additional employment opportunities
for resettlers.
Over-reliance on compensation leaves
resettlement communities impoverished once the compensation ends. Cash
compensation can also result in conflict between and within communities
and between individuals within households.

Giving more
power to displaced people during the planning process is essential for
effective resettlement. This includes planning of irrigation systems, selecting
appropriate sites for resettlement and identifying suitable economic and
culturally appropriate opportunities. If possible, dams should be situated in
locations that avoid resettlement. Where resettlement is unavoidable, projects
must benefit both construction companies and the local community to be
successful. Such scenarios will need participation of and partnership with the
local community. 
The research makes
several recommendations to ensure resettlement projects benefit poor people:

Before
each project, consider a wider range of energy and water resource
development options. Should a dam be selected, minimise resettlement as
much as possible. 
Where
resettlement is unavoidable, plan for affected people to become project
beneficiaries.
Provide
finance for communities to recruit the necessary experts, such as lawyers,
engineers and health experts.
Improve
understanding of local knowledge, values and lifestyles. Development
projects must balance new opportunities with culture and traditions.
Provide
resettled people with irrigated land and employment opportunities to
complement traditional rainfed agriculture.
Ensure
resettled communities have access to common property resources and
opportunities, such as reservoir fisheries, tourism and employment
training.

eldis:A75529;Collective land access rights for enhancing smallholder livelihoods;;"Land liberalisation policies and programmes based on giving individual property rights implemented in the last decades have not produced the expected results in improving rural peasant and/or native livelihoods in Andean and African countries. Previous studies have found mixed results, with more recent literature showing that these programmes were ineffective in increasing productivity, input use or access to credit. On the contrary, emerging literature suggests that maintaining collective land access rights may have positive effects on rural livelihoods in particular for indigenous and peasant communities.

The proposed research will investigate the effect of collective land access on smallholder livelihoods, by comparing different sorts of collective land access rights functioning in four territories in Peru and Kenya to see under which conditions they achieve positive performances in improving livelihoods.

eldis:A75481;Land reform in Korea ;;"Land reform, which became widespread all over the world for a while after World War II, lost steam rapidly after the 1970s. Then, when the 21st century began, land reform-forgotten for a generation-has received attention again. Above all, this is because it has been a widely recognized perception that land reform should be required in order to solve poverty. This report examines how land reform has had an effect on the general economy and society of a country, based on Korea’s experience in land reform. It is highly expected that Korea’s experience will provide developing countries and international organizations, which have renewed interest in land reform, with a lot of implications. Although Korea’s land reform was historically the most successful case, it is unfortunate that continued research has not been conducted both at home and abroad. Taking the opportunity of the Knowledge Sharing Program (KSP) module project, this report has been prepared for sharing implications of Korea’s land reform with developing countries through more systematic evaluations of land reform

eldis:A40432;Malaysian palm oil - green gold or green wash?;;"Focusing on Sarawak, this paper confronts the misleading claims of the Malaysian palmoil lobby and aims to inform decision makers about the serious sustainability challenges the palm oil sector faces on the ground. Key areas of contention highlighted include that:

    the Malaysian palm oil lobby claims that zero-burning is strictly enforced by Malaysia’s laws. The authors argue that this claim is false. Sarawak has in place its own environmental laws, which allow plantation companies to practice open burning to clear land for planting, even on peat soils
    the Malaysian palm oil lobby states that “forests are not converted for oil palm expansion in Malaysia”. This claim is also seen as false. The report asserts that there is an overwhelming body of evidence that oil palm plantations are being expanded at the expense of tropical forests
    the Malaysian palm oil lobby also claims that the Penan indigenous communities in Sarawak were given large tracts of virgin forests to sustain their nomadic way of life - which is also regarded a false claim. The “Biosphere Reserves” promised to the Penan have no legal basis and have never materialised.

To address the serious sustainability challenges of the oil palm sector in Malaysia, the paper recommends that:

    the EU and Member States should limit additional demand for palm oil products by: halting the use of edible oils for energy purposes; abandoning the 10% EU target for bio-fuels and all incentives for the use of palm oil for energy purposes; promoting and supporting efforts to improve transparency; and establishing business systems that apply best practices in dealing with sustainability challenges in the sector 
    the Sarawak state government and the Malaysian Federal Government should recognise the full nature and stature of Native Customary Rights (NCR) of its indigenous peoples as accorded by the law, establish a system of joint-boundary demarcation with native communities to demarcate native territorial boundaries and claims, and strictly enforce a zero burning policy for commercial plantation development 
    the Malaysian oil palm industry, and its customers and investors should acknowledge the sustainability challenges in the sector and ensure that all the parties involved are committed to addressing them.

eldis:A40430;Guidelines for applying protected area management categories;;"The IUCN protected area management categories are a global framework, recognised by the Convention on Biological Diversity, for categorising the variety of protected area management types. The following guidelines provide direction, descriptions, principles and advice in the application of the IUCN protected area management categories in particular biomes and management approaches.The document is broken into different sections focusing on key discussions on IUCN protected area management, which are included below. 

    What does IUCN’s mean by “protected area” and what is the purpose behind the categories? Each category is described by its main objective, distinguishing features, role in the landscape or seascape, unique points and actions that are compatible or incompatible
    Although categories are independent of who owns, controls, or has responsibility for management, governance is still very important. Governance types by government bodies, indigenous peoples, communities and private bodies are identified in order to help in understanding, planning for and recording protected areas.
    What processes are used for applying categories?The discussion looks at: choosing and agreeing the most suitable category for a given situation; assigning the category to meet national and international standards; and recording the protected area and category with the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre
    Protected areas embrace a huge range of biomes, ownership patterns and motivations. Specific cases are looked at in more detail where in the past there has been cause of confusion on the management objectives set and the subsequent categories that are then applied. Examples include: forests, sacred natural sites, freshwater areas, etc.
    How do Ramsar and the World Heritage conventions relate to the IUCN categories?
    Effectiveness of categories - options are examined as to ways of assessing protected areas that are failing to meet their objective in their category more effective.

eldis:A38181;Women, slums and urbanisation: examining the causes and consequences;;"Countries throughout the world are rapidly urbanising, particularly in the developing world, and for the first time in human history, the majority of people today are no longer living in rural areas, but rather in cities. This report examines the worldwide phenomenon of urbanisation from the point of view of women’s housing rights. The report focuses, in particular, on the experiences of women and girls living in slum communities throughout the world, premised on the idea that both the causes and consequences of urbanisation for women are, in fact, unique and deeply related to issues of gender. The report highlights women’s experiences from Africa, Asia and the Americas and background information on the global realities of urbanisation, including trends and analysis. The authors assess some of the primary ‘drivers’ for women’s migration to the cities, including issues such as violence against women, forced eviction, and the feminisation of poverty. These drivers illuminate some of the causes of urbanisation from a gender-sensitive perspective, reflecting the various catalysts which serve to propel women into the cities. Finally the report presents the key findings and conclusions of the study based on research conducted in the field. These include that governments should: 

    provide security of tenure, as a matter of priority, to women and their families living in slums 
    combat violence against women in all its forms, and provide  effective legal and other remedies to victims of gender-based  violence
    invest in slum upgrading programmes and housing development programmes for the poor, ensuring women’s  effective participation 
    ensure joint ownership of and control over housing, land, and  property, as well as equal rights between men and women in  marriage 
    enforce women’s inheritance rights and equal rights to marital property 
    raise awareness about women’s human rights, including  women’s housing rights, at community and institutional levels

eldis:A70779;Natural resources, the environment and conflict;;"This report emanates from an exploratory study conducted in 2009 by the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD), in collaboration with the Madariaga-College of Europe Foundation. With a focus on Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan, the study solicited views and perspectives on the role that natural resources and the environment can play in complex conflict situations. As part of the exploratory study, ACCORD carried out desktop research and interviews with representatives of civil society organisations (CSOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international institutions in March and April 2009.

In reviewing the exploratory study and preparing this report, ACCORD observed five main challenges. The challenges relate first to the problem of natural resources and the environment in complex conflict situations, and second, to the actors that can play a constructive role in natural resource, environmental and conflict management.


	conflict management: increasingly, conflict management approaches should take the environment and natural resources into account when attempting to prevent violent conflict from erupting; negotiating and implementing durable peace agreements; deploying peace support operations; and establishing preventative and post-conflict peacebuilding mechanisms
	a lack of viable alternatives: environmental changes and inequalities in the global economy are not solely responsible for resource exploitation or direct causes of conflict. Rather, it is the lack of alternatives for those reliant on the natural environment for their livelihoods and/or for power and wealth that can contribute to conflict
	
	conflict-sensitive natural resource and environmental planning: Relating to the first challenge, the absence of long-term strategic conflict-sensitive planning – which takes into account creeping vulnerabilities and assesses their negative impact on livelihoods and conflicts – undermines future conflict management and peacebuilding
	
	
	government and civil society: the interdependent role of government and civil society actors in environmental and natural resource governance is vital for the equitable management of natural resources, environmental protection and strengthening sustainable livelihoods
	


 


	external actors:neighbouring states, multinational companies (MNCs) and other non-state actors involved in illegal extraction of resources can benefit from – and consequently, contribute to – the perpetuation of chaotic conflict situations


Finally, the report concludes with observations about renewable and non-renewable resources and environmental factors.

Recommendations include that:

    the Malian State should fulfill its obligations in the areas of respect, protection, and promotion of human rights 
    the mining companies operating in Mali should publish in their entirety figures concerning mine

eldis:A71475;Natural resources and conflict: A guide for mediation practitioners;;"Natural resources such as land, water, timber, minerals, metals and oil are vitally important sources of livelihoods, income and influence for countries and communities around the globe. When natural resources are poorly managed or inequitably shared, however, or when business operations are implemented without due consideration for context and communities, they can contribute to tensions that can escalate into violent conflict, or feed into and exacerbate pre-existing conflict dynamics. Moreover, population growth and environmental degradation are intensifying competition over already scarce resources, such as land and water, and climate change threatens to increase such competition even further. It comes as no surprise, then, that many experts and governments expect natural resources to become key drivers in a growing number of disputes, with potentially significant consequences for international, regional, and national peace and security. In light of these risks, renewed attention needs to be paid to mechanisms for mitigating and resolving natural resource disputes. One particularly useful tool is mediation, which can be defined as a non-adversarial and collaborative process through which an impartial third party helps parties in a dispute reach a resolution through interest-based negotiations.

This guide seeks to demonstrate the value of mediation as an effective tool for resolving disputes around natural resources. Drawing from decades of hands-on mediation experience, it offers practical advice for mediation professionals and supporting institutions involved in localized or transboundary natural resource disputes, or those engaged in peace processes where natural resources play a critical role. As a starting point, it offers a structured methodology for mediating natural resource conflicts, which is divided into four phases: assessment; pre-negotiation preparedness; negotiation; and, implementation. Against this framework, the guide also examines sector-specific challenges that may arise when mediating conflicts over extractive resources, land, or water, and provides guidance on intervention strategies for natural resources in the broader context of peace negotiations.

The guide culminates with seven key messages for improving the practice of mediating disputes over natural resources:


	Context is extremely important
	Effective mediation requires a clear but nuanced mapping of actors and interests
	Equal access to impartial scientific and technical information about the resource in dispute is key
	Careful attention is needed to identify the stakeholders that should be engaged in the mediation process
	Mediation should aim for collaboration over shared benefits, which can generate the trust needed to tackle other issues
	Mediation techniques are available to overcome critical impasses and entrenched positions

eldis:A70671;Freeport McMoran versus the People of Fungurume: How the largest mining investment in DRC has brought poverty not prosperity;;"The Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM) company controls a 1,600 square kilometre mining concession in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Tenke Fungurume deposits make up one of the most important reserves of copper and cobalt in the world with abundant quantities of high assay ore.

This report looks at a consultation with a wide range of officials, members of institutions, groups and organisations, and other interested individuals living in the concession area about the impact of the TFM mine on their lives and livelihoods.

Previously, the main source of income in the region was agricultural produce. However, farmers have lost their fields – without adequate compensation in most cases – and now struggle to find good vacant land for their crops because almost all the most fertile agricultural land is located within the concession area, and TFM does not allow the former owners to farm there.


The same problem applies to artisanal miners, who are denied access to the source of their livelihoods. People living within the concession even have trouble collecting stone or wood for construction because everything – even natural resources like rocks and trees – belongs to TFM.

This loss of traditional livelihoods has not been compensated for sufficiently by the provision of extra funds or of jobs on the mine. Indeed, the general expectation that TFM would employ local labour and use local contractors does not appear to have been met.

Recommendations to TFM


	TFM must improve its consultation with the local population to ensure that social projects have a long-term positive impact on surrounding communities
	TFM must increase the transparency of the Social Development Fund and directly involve the population in decision-making
	TFM must urgently close down Camp Bravo to ensure employees live with the local community and to boost the local economy
	TFM must favour the emergence of a local middle class by granting sub-contracts to local operators
	TFM must give the inhabitants access to fertile agricultural land for their subsistence and encourage local agricultural production and co-operatives
	TFM must allow the inhabitants to collect local construction materials such as stone and wood

eldis:A73952;Mineral rights, rents and resources in South Africa’s development narrative;;South Africa is endowed with substantial subsoil mineral wealth, yet the development promise typically associated with this wealth has not been realised. Between 2001 and 2008 the South African mining industry contracted at a rate of 1% a year, while comparable mining jurisdictions grew at an average of 5% a year.1 This period marked the longest commodity price boom in recent history. South Africa’s failure to capitalise on the boom provides a clue to the country’s puzzling post-1994 economic and political development.This paper explores potential explanations for South Africa’s economic underperformance since 1994. Despite the country’s substantial subsoil mineral wealth endowment, the development promise typically associated with such wealth has not been realised. The democratic dividend has produced some level of macroeconomic stability, but large fault lines have emerged, especially since the 2008 financial crisis.The paper examines whether ‘Dutch disease’ explanations can account for weak manufacturing performance, but finds that they are inadequate. Given mining’s continued importance to the economy, the paper explores whether mineral resources could be better leveraged for inclusive development. It concludes that more coherent institutional choices are required if this is to come to fruition. Currently, the mineral rights regime, traditional leadership legislation and industrial policy are not sufficiently integrated to give effect to the ambitions of the National Development Plan as they pertain to the potential contribution of mining to the economy. Mineral rents could provide the impetus for upstream technology and product development, but the mining industry first has to generate growth.Beyond mining, economically inefficient visa regulations, electricity shortages and a general lack of policy clarity all contribute to South Africa’s weak economic performance. Addressing these factors would attract the growth-inducing investment required for sustained and inclusive economic growth. ;R.

eldis:A63221;Where the rain falls: climate change, food and livelihood security, and migration;;This comparative study highlights that rainfall variability and food insecurity are key drivers for human mobility. The empirical research is based on eight country case studies, including a 1,300 household survey and participatory research sessions involving 2,000 individuals. The results reveal that migration is an important risk management strategy for vulnerable households. Land scarce households trying to cope with food insecurity send migrants during the hunger season to find food or money to buy food. Migration is often temporary and seasonal, if migrants are successful, but can be permanent if options cannot be found to deal with rainfall variability and rural food insecurity. The report states that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities – both in terms of minimising pressure on vulnerable populations and providing adaptation options – must underlie policy negotiations on climate induced migration and subsequent implementation at all levels. ;K.

eldis:A70451;Conflict gold to criminal gold: the new face of artisanal gold mining in Congo;;"The objective of this research report was to establish whether, and to what extent, post-conflict efforts at national, regional and international levels are improving the situation of artisanal gold-mining communities in the provinces of Orientale, North and South Kivu, and Maniema in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The research proceeded from the assumption that legal and regulatory instruments and institutions created after the 2006 elections to regularise and support the DRC’s informal mining sector should now be starting to show positive effects. This report sought to verify that assumption.

Key recommendations


	stop the criminal exploitation of the gold-mining sector: the government must act to halt the increasingly criminal exploitation of artisanal and small-scale miners by a plague of government bureaucrats, officials and security agents – and end the illegal export of almost 100% of the gold produced in the east
	provide adequate physical protection to miners: if the government provided adequate physical protection to artisanal and small-scale miners – by reallocating funds to support legitimate army regiments – gold production would increase and so would the sector’s impact on individual livelihoods and the region’s economy
	Protect artisanal and small-scale gold miners from racketeers: the government needs to tackle the racketeers, who are buying the miners’ gold at unfairly low prices and selling them food, tools and other merchandise at hugely inflated prices – and leaving them constantly digging for survival
	reorganise or close SAESSCAM: the Service for the Assistance and Supervision of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (SAESSCAM) was established to support miners but its underpaid – or often unpaid – agents simply extort ‘taxes’, ‘levies’ and other ‘fees’ without providing any services in return. The government must totally restructure the institution or close it down

eldis:A38322;Global corruption report 2008: corruption in the water sector;;"Divided into three parts, this collaborative work looks at the varied challenges brought about as a result of corruption in the water sector. It also looks at recent research conducted and provides an overview of the water sector corruption challenges in country profiles across the globe. Corruption in the water sector puts the lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk. The onset of climate change and the increasing stress on water supply around the world make the fight against corruption in water more urgent than ever. Without increased advocacy to stop corruption in water, there will be high costs to economic and human development, the destruction of vital ecosystems, and the fuelling of social tension or even conflict over this essential resource. Corruption in water is a significant factor in the climate change agenda and therefore, also a critical issue for global public policy. The impact of corruption in the water sector on lives, livelihoods, food security and international cooperation also underscores the many linkages to global policy concerns. A number of lessons are highlighted from efforts in fighting water sector corruption across countries. These lessons and subsequent recommendations include: 

    prevent corruption in the water sector, as cleaning up after it is difficult and expensive - when corruption leads to contaminated drinking water and destroyed ecosystems, the detrimental consequences are often irreversible 
    understand the local water context, otherwise reforms will fail. One size never fits all in fighting corruption, but this is particularly the case in the water sector, where conditions of supply and demand, existing infrastructure and governance systems vary widely 
    cleaning up water corruption should not be at odds with the needs of the poor. The costs of corruption in the water sector are disproportionately borne by the poor. Pro-poor anti-corruption efforts should focus on the types of service provision that matter most to them, such as public standpipes or drilling rural wells 
    build pressure for water reform from above and from below - ending corruption in the water sector requires breaking the interlocking interests and relationships that are perpetuating the problem. Leadership from the top is necessary to create political will and drive institutional reform 
    scale up and refine the diagnosis of corruption in water – the momentum and effectiveness of reform depend on it. Tools such as corruption impact assessments and public expenditure tracking need to be refined, adopted widely across the water sector and adapted to specific local contexts to lay the foundations for targeted reform.

The project aims to identify the type and scale of national and sub-national programmes and projects that have been funded by climate finance and how they relate to local water security.

The case study report reviews the evidence base on water security and climate change for Zambia, and explores the nexus between the two thematic areas; reviews the policy and institutional frameworks for climate finance in Zambia, and sets out an analysis of the reported climate finance funds flowing from international donors. It then goes on to set out an analysis of the identified climate finance flows categorised in terms of their relevance to a hierarchy of water security issues and presents the study’s conclusions and recommendations.

eldis:A15134;Time for transparency: coming clean on oil, mining and gas revenues;;This report explores how, across the world, the revenues from oil, gas and mining that should be funding sustainable economic development have often been misappropriated and mismanaged. Specifically, it analyses five major examples of this problem: Kazakhstan, Congo Brazzaville, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Nauru.The report argues that in these countries, governments do not provide even basic information about their revenues from natural resources. Nor do oil, mining and gas companies publish any information about payments made to governments. Huge amounts of money are therefore not subject to any oversight and crooked elites can extract all sorts of ‘facilitation payments’ from firms that would probably prefer not to pay bribes. Ordinary citizens, who often own a country’s resources under its constitution, are thus left without the information to call their governments to account over the management of their revenues. The end result is a litany of corruption, social decay, increased poverty, reinforcement of authoritarian government and political unrest, which can ultimately lead to state failure and the spread of instability across regions.Recommendations to increase the transparency of natural resource revenues include:all resource-rich developing countries and resource extraction companies should actively participate in the UK government’s Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and seek to voluntarily disclose their revenues from resource extraction. However, voluntary disclosure will not work everywhere that transparency is most needed because many political and business elites have a vested interest in avoiding transparency to protect their illicit profitsa set of joined-up policies is needed to make resource extraction companies publish what they pay to governments on a country-by-country basis and to make host governments publish what they earnsimple adjustments to existing policies of company disclosure, ‘books and records’ provisions in anti-corruption legislation, and international accounting standards can be used to require multinational companies to ‘publish what they pay’export credit agencies, bilateral and multilateral bodies, and banks should make all their lending ;;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2004;en;"mining;extractive industries";;;"AGO;GNQ;UKR;KGZ;202;RUS;MDA;030;BLR;009;TJK;TKM;UZB;KAZ;ARM;NRU";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A15134;http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/115/en/time_for_transparency;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Fmedia_library_detail.php%2F115%2Fen%2Ftime_for_transparency;;;;"Natural resource revenue;oil;Congo Brazzaville;Private sector corruption;Good Governance;gas;Governance;Business and corruption;Extractive industries mining;Mining;Corporate Social Responsibility;natural resources;Good governance corruption;Extractive industries oil;Extractive industries;transparency"
eldis:A75597;Why is prior consultation not yet an effective tool for conflict resolution? The case of Peru;;"This Working Paper from the German Institute of Global and Area Studies argues that new legislation in Peru will not help to turn prior consultations into a tool for conflict resolution as long as the normative framework itself is contested and the necessary basic conditions are not in place.

Prior consultation is an increasingly accepted instrument internationally for guaranteeing the rights of indigenous peoples. Conceived of theoretically as a means for conflict resolution, in practice it lies at the heart of social conflicts all over Latin America. Using concepts from the “contentious politics” approach, the authors take a closer look at Peru – where indigenous mobilisations would lead to the only Latin American consultation law enacted to date. They also critically analyse the content and formulation of its regulating norm. They argue that this new legislation will not help to turn such consultations into a tool for conflict resolution as long as the normative framework itself is contested and the necessary basic conditions are not in place. The most important conditions that they identify for implementing effective prior consultation are impartial state institutions capable of justly balancing the diverse interests at stake, measures that reduce power asymmetries within consultations, and joint decision?making processes with binding agreements.

eldis:A9335;Reducing conflict and improving resource management for Kenyan pastoralists;;Governments and scientists have long regarded the pastoralists’ way of life as a cause of environmental degradation. This belief is rooted in a misunderstanding of the pastoralist way of life and is reflected in national policies on land tenure and resource access in Kenya. The area of land controlled by pastoralists has been steadily reduced, and pastoralists have been encouraged to give up their nomadic way of life and settle, leading to conflict between pastoralist groups and other land users and damage to the environment. ;Rachel Berger;;id21 Development Research Reporting Service;eldis;01/01/2003;en;"environment;natural resources management;pastoralists";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";Land Use, Management & Investment;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A9335;http://www.id21.org/nr/r2rb1g1.html;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.id21.org%2Fnr%2Fr2rb1g1.html;;;;"Environment;natural resources;NRM;resource management Kenya;natural resources management;degradation;peace building;livelihood security;Agriculture and food;pastoralism;conflict resolution;erosion;Pastoralism;conflict"
eldis:A72094;Oil, corruption and conflict in West Africa: The failure of governance and corporate social responsibility;;"Natural resources are a noted cause of intra-state conflict and deserve recognition as such by ECOWAS. Oil, in particular, is linked to frequent civil strife and conflicts induced by slow rates of economic growth, weak and undemocratic governments, rampant corruption and heavy militarization. Many African countries have already suffered the negative consequences of an oil-dependency, including Angola, which endured a brutal civil war that lasted for more than a quarter-century. Recent new discoveries of oil in West Africa have made the region a high priority for investment by International Oil Companies (IOC’s), especially since governments such as the United States have begun to regard West African oil production as an alternative to reliance on oil exports from Middle East.  Unless a concerted effort is made to change the nature of the industry, the hope that the abundance of oil in West Africa will foster significant poverty reduction will come to knot.

The aim of this monograph is to examine the correlation between corporate behavior and an increased potential for conflict in oil-producing countries. The study asserts that IOCs can and must change their way of doing business, and that by working cooperatively with the international and advocacy communities, that change will reduce or even eliminate conflicts and other maladies of resource-rich West African countries. The scope of this study includes oil producers in the Gulf of Guinea, particularly West Africa, but also includes Angola and newcomer Equatorial Guinea.

In conclusion, the author suggests that relevant elements of the Conflict Prevention Mechanism, including the Executive Secretariat, should strive to achieve a balance between the aims and interests of NGO’s, the international community, governments, indigenous communities, the IOC’s and private sector contractors. This is admittedly easier said than done, but for West Africans to benefit economically from extractive activities on their soil there must be a collective responsibility for that outcome, to be addressed as a regional priority, if future conflicts are to be avoided.

eldis:A70078;Illegal sand mining in South Africa;;"Natural sand from estuary and coastal land is one of South Africa’s most valuable resources. However, there has recently been a drastic increase in uncontrolled and unauthorised sand mining activities in rivers, valleys and estuaries throughout the country. The frameworks governing small-scale sand mining in South Africa lack the necessary financial and human resource capacities to support better environmental compliance, and the enforcement mechanisms to successfully deter illegal activities are weak. Consequently, there has been a flurry of new entrants to the sector, creating a system fraught with social, environmental, legislative and structural challenges. Although the cumulative impact of these illegal activities is yet to be fully determined, existing policy and management responses do not have the urgency required to prevent the irreversible destruction of riverbeds and associated estuarine zones.

Recommendations include:


	an evaluation of the cumulative impact of sand mining in a given environment should inform the decision to mine sand. Permits should be granted with due consideration to extraction limits and the natural sediment yield of the river system
	illegal mines should be closed immediately, and estuary and riparian sand mining should be halted. Sand supplies must be obtained elsewhere, eg, by seeking more sustainable, nonriparian mining and dredging marine deposits

eldis:A62801;Building urban resilience: principles, tools and practice;;"This handbook summarises the guiding principles, tools and practice in key economic sectors that can facilitate the implementation of resilience concepts into decisions related to infrastructure investments and general urban management as a means of reducing disaster and climate risks. It is divided into three sections designed to help urban planners and practitioners build elements of resilience into their urban governance and city planning. Chapter 1 presents key guiding principles for resilient cities in the context of today’s urban development. Chapter 2 focuses on the most common and effective tools and methodologies available and steps in using them. Chapter 3 provides guidance in identifying, planning and implementing urban investment projects, focusing on three major sectors: water; energy and communications; and transportation systems.

For example, the paper by Muniruzzaman ilustrates how water ignores political and community boundaries, and how decisions in one place can significantly affect water use elsewhere. India’s plans to build more dams could, for instance, have devastating affects for Pakistan’s agricultural productivity which is highly dependent on water supply from the Indus River. The paper also identifies three ways in which climate change can affect human migration: warming climate will reduce the agricultural potential in some regions undermining core ecosystem services; increasing extreme weather events will generate mass displacement; sea-level rise will destroy the low-lying coastal areas forcing millions of people to relocate permanently.

eldis:A32383;The new broker: beyond agreement;;"This document discusses the challenges and dilemmas in multi-stakeholder partnering work, particularly the development and use of metrics to measure progress. It is aimed particularly at partner organisations, and individuals hired to aid in the facilitation, monitoring or management of partnerships as independent, ‘external’, third-parties.
Through a fictitious dialogue, it highlights the need for sensitively tracking and evaluating the performance of partnerships in which individuals are engaged. With an intentional focus on the oil and gas sector, this work is an alternative source of information on partnership brokering, providing a contrast to the growing number of more serious guides, manuals and academic journal articles on the subject. The tools and principles presented in this book are, however, transferable to other businesses and development sectors.

eldis:A66103;China’s economic statecraft and African mineral resources: changing modes of engagement;;"China’s impressive inroads into Africa’s resources sectors over the past decade are explained largely by the timely match between a cash-loaded China in search of raw materials and a continent with a vast pool of underdeveloped mineral deposits, exploration of which has been hindered for decades by underinvestment and infrastructure bottlenecks.  Chinese ‘infrastructure-for-resources’ loans are ultimately a product of the convergence of Chinese and African interests at the dawn of the 21st century. This loan formula, swapping infrastructure for resources, came into being largely as a default strategy, inspired by China’s own domestic experience, its competitive advantages and African receptiveness to this kind of barter deal.  The paper explores how China has consistently used this approach over the past decade as a positive economic statecraft tool to pursue mineral resources security goals in Africa; and how the need to adjust its approach to challenges and new opportunities on the ground has led to noticeable shifts in recent years. It argues that, although infrastructure for resources remains an important tool to meet Beijing’s supply concerns, China’s strategies to access resource assets have become more diversified and market oriented, with its stateowned enterprises taking the lead and engaging increasingly in mergers and acquisitions.

eldis:A12940;Soil conservation in Tigray, Ethiopia;;This report presents a review into soil erosion and conservation research and efforts made in Tigray.The report includes both traditional measures and activities promoted by non-government organisations (NGO's) and government projects. Main emphasis is placed on stone terracing and stone bunds since these are the most widely used soil conservation measures in the region. Relatively limited research has been made in Tigray, therefore the report includes some findings from other parts of the Ethiopian highlands for comparison.Findings include: the building of stone terraces in Hagere Selam, Tigray, led to increased yields of wheat on four-year old terraces. Farmers also seem to be aware of the long-term effects of soil conservation measures on crop yields, but may not be in a position to act on their own to protect their soil.Recommendations include:a new approach to the farmer in many cases. Since reducing soil erosion is likely to be a less important objective for the farmer than securing immediate food needs, recommended changes should be shown to provide tangible resultsconstruction of mechanical conservation structures should be followed up by other inputs, such as fertiliser, improved seeds, and other farming factors. If no additional improvement is offered, the promised yield increase from conservation measures is likely to be small ;K.Vågen Esser;;Noragric, Department of International Environment and Development Studies, Norwegian University of Life Sciences;eldis;01/01/2002;en;"agriculture;farmers";;;"ETH;202";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A12940;http://www.nlh.no/noragric/publications/reports/rep5_bodytext.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nlh.no%2Fnoragric%2Fpublications%2Freports%2Frep5_bodytext.pdf;;;;"Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Farmers;SOIL;Crop production seeds and fertilizers;Ethiopia;Soil and land management;agriculture;Norway;Agriculture Norway;conservation;erosion;EADI;terraces;Agriculture and food;Soils Norway;Drylands Norway;Agriculture inputs;crops;Africa;Tigray;yield;terracing"
eldis:A24695;Chop fine: the human rights impact of local government corruption and mismanagement in Rivers State, Nigeria;;This Human Rights Watch report examines the misuse of public funds by local officials in the Rivers State of Nigeria’s. It is based on interviews in Rivers state with government and donor agency officials, civil servants, health care workers, teachers, civil society groups and local residents. Also state and local government budgets are analysed.Despite Nigeria’s strong oil industry ordinary Nigerians have derived appallingly little benefit from that wealth and the misuse of public funds by local officials had harmful effects on primary education and basic health care. Findings of the report include: Local governments have failed to make more than nominal investments into health care and educationAt the same time, the governor of Rivers budgeted tens of millions of dollars that year alone on questionable priorities like foreign travel, “gifts” and “souvenirs” to unspecified recipients, and the purchase of jet aircraft and fleets of new cars for his office Part of the reason these problems have not been addressed is that nearly eight years after the end of military rule, the people of Rivers State still have no way of holding their local officials accountable for their actions.Human Rights Watch urges all levels of government in Nigeria to enact without delay key reforms to make state and local governments more transparent and accountable to the public. Their detailed report gives clear recommendations for a number of different stakeholders. Recommendations include: The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria should enact and sign into law the Freedom of Information, Fiscal Responsibility and Public Audit and Accountability bills without delay The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission should be more proactive in launching and following through on criminal investigations into credible allegations of corruption The Government of Rivers State should increase budgetary expenditures for health and education so as to progressively realise these basic rights   Foreign governments and donor agencies should prioritise programmes to improve good governance and transparency of state and local governments in Nigeria Foreign companies operating in the Niger Delta should publish and ensure wide public dissemination of regular and detailed accountings of all development, social and humanitarian expenditures undertaken by the company in the Niger Delta in order to differentiate private from public funding, and make government expenditures more transparent. ;Ch.

eldis:A65123;Water security and climate resilient development: investing in water security for growth and development;;"This technical paper has been produced by the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) to support the implementation of the Strategic Framework for Water Security and Climate Resilience Development, developed by the African Union through AMWOC. The framework itself seeks to help with the identification, development and mainstreaming of ‘no/low regrets’ investment strategies, and to make development planning activities more resilient to climate change. In providing detail on the concepts and methodologies underpinning each step of the framework, as well as information on financial strategies available, this technical paper supports the frameworks’ goals of achieving water security and climate resilient development through the strengthening of institutional capacity, improving knowledge and enhancing partnerships. The paper comprises of twelve chapters providing comprehensive and detailed guidance to the various aspects of implementing the framework:

    the use and construction of climate change and socioeconomic scenarios in development planning
    how to make the case for water security and climate resilient development
    stakeholder perspectives, with examples of stakeholder roles and responsibilities
    climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability assessments
    identifying opportunities for building resilience in existing development programmes
    finding new and innovative investment opportunities
    ensuring robust investment options in the face of uncertain climate changes through risk management and characterisation
    single- and multi-criterion approaches to appraising the economics of investment options
    the integration of no/low regrets investments into the development process
    developing financing and investment strategies, which looks at the cost of water security and climate resilient development, infrastructure funding, and examples of financing strategies
    mainstreaming climate resilience in development planning
    lessons learned, as well as monitoring and evaluation – the iterative nature of these aspects is emphasised in that they should provide continuity and informative input into subsequent assessments and activities.

eldis:A18812;Beyond the rhetoric - measuring revenue transparency in the oil and gas industries: company performance report;;This report explores direct action that companies can take to support improved transparency of revenue flows in the extractive industries. It examines what progress has been made by companies through voluntary initiatives, and also to illustrates what steps should be taken if genuine transparency is to be achieved.Findings of the report are:systematic disclosure of payments for every country of operation presents a better practice than the country-focused approach, by which companies negotiate with host governmentsvariations in company performance within the same host country indicate that there is more room for improvement than is currently being demonstratedsome companies have similar levels of supportive disclosure across different countries of operation suggesting that company policy and systems can affect practice on the ground, and are not always hostage to individual country contextscompanies tend to put a large amount of information in the public domain in a format that is often unwieldy, heavy on narrative, and unnecessarily complicated without policies in place to tackle corruption and whistle blower protection it is difficult to see how companies can genuinely promote transparency and good governance of revenues.The report also identifies a number of recommendations. As the report highlights, companies should:publish what they pay to governments wherever they operate on a country-by-country basiscall on G8 governments to announce a commitment to developing global standards at the G8 summit this year adopt a more systematic approach to publishing payments made to governments in every country in which they operate by, for example, publishing a clear company policy on transparency or developing  a simple reporting templatework collaboratively with other companies, civil society and host governments to build disclosure agreements into their contracts actively engage with the EITI to support progress where host governments are willing improve anti-corruption and whistle-blowing systems where performance is pooruse the standards provided in this report to measure and publicise progress on transparency issues against competitors on an annual basis. ;;;Save the Children Fund ;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A18812;http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC18137.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldis.org%2Fvfile%2Fupload%2F1%2Fdocument%2F0708%2FDOC18137.pdf;;;;"Private sector corruption;Corporate Social Responsibility;Good governance corruption;Extractive industries oil;Governance;Business and corruption;Extractive industries;Good Governance"
eldis:A18816;Beyond the rhetoric - measuring revenue transparency: home government requirements for disclosure in the oil and gas industries;;"This report explores direct action that home countries can take to support improved transparency of revenue flows in the extractive industries. Home countries are those which are ""home"" to companies either registered or raising capital within their jurisdictions. For this report, ten home countries were ranked on the four areas of : (1) requirements for disclosure of revenue payments, (2) requirements for disclosure of supportive financial information, (3)access to information legislation, and (3) broader governance.Findings of the report include:there was disappointing performance from countries with existing commitments to transparency, as for example an absence of requirements for country-level disclosure, meaning that citizens from host countries are unable to find out what revenues their governments have received from extractive companiesleadership on disclosure requirements comes from a non-EITI country, namely Canada leadership on access to information also comes from a non-EITI country, namely South Africa as well as the harmonisation of international accounting standards, there are also moves towards harmonisation of securities regulations at the European level, i.e. EC Directive 2001/34/EC and amendments via the ""Prospectus Directive"" and the ""Transparency Directive"" however, the disclosure power of securities regulations is often diluted by various relaxation or exemption clausesmany countries reported a lack of co-ordination between different government departments about disclosure commitments in the extractive sector.The report also offers a number of recommendations:Home governments should seize the opportunity of reforms in financial regulations to ensure that companies operating within their jurisdiction publish what they pay to governments in all the countries in which they operate all regulators involved in convergence should focus on a ""race to the top"" in standards rather than any lapse into the lowest common denominator where existing accounting standards provide ""grey areas"" on scope for publishing of revenue payments, these need to be utilised by companies, NGOs and investors access to information legislation should cover information held by the private sector, as this would potentially allow a citizen to request and get information about payments made by companies to host governments.

It presents short case studies of experiences in the Philippines, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Romania, Colombia, Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, which then uses to make recommendations. The report argues that:IFIs have pressured governments in poor countries to rigorously open up to foreign investment in the extractive industries, and have channelled billions of dollars directly to large transnational corporations (TNCs) to finance the construction of drilling platforms, pipelines and large-scale mineswhile the external debt continues to grow and on the ground development benefits have yet to materialise, the coal, oil, gas and minerals are exported out of the countriesthis export-led development paradigm has been devastating for local communities: poverty is soaring, and ecosystems are ravagedcorporations, which rake in large profits, benefit the most from this lopsided arrangementRecommendations include:IFIs should establish a plan to phase out investments in the extractive sectors, including structural adjustment lendingas a first and immediate step, IFIs should establish no-go areas such as protected areas, indigenous peoples’ zones and areas of armed conflict, where they will not promote oil, mining and gas projectsIFIs should focus their remaining investments in extractive industries on the closing down of mines, on helping displaced industry workers to find new jobs, on restoring degraded ecosystems and communities, and on the shift towards renewable energy projectsall actors involved should cooperate in repairing the damage done by past projectsgovernments should shift their financial support to decentralised and participatory initiatives that truly benefit people and the environment (i.e. a transition to renewable, efficient and decentralised energy production for sustainable societies)[adapted from author] ;"J.

eldis:A18089;Oil and water in Sudan;;Sudan, a nation of 36 million people wracked by conflict for 34 of the last 45 years, has generated some four million displaced people during the course of its war. It is estimated that over two million Sudanese people have died as a result of fighting and related starvation and disease.  Most conventional analyses have focussed on the identity-based dichotomies to explain the conflict.  This paper identifies how environmental and ecological variables contribute to the war and how it is waged in Sudan.The paper’s analysis is guided by a hypothesis linking five ecological variables to the conflict cycle. The authors expect that competition for scarce resources will emerge as a causal factor. They also anticipate that an important determinant will be the struggle to exploit and control the ecological sources of surplus value - oil in particular.The analysis of the Sudanese conflict cycle begins with an overview of the Sudan conflict, tracing the system’s history, underlying pattern and distinctive features. This in turn reveals systemic elements and cyclical dynamics of the Sudan conflict system, which can then be used to guide policy interventions.Turning to the environmental analysis, the paper explores the interaction between people and their environment in Sudan, illustrating how natural systems shape the north-south divide. It then examines the patterns of resource consumption and management, revealing how a topdown approach to resource management has deepened the fissures in the Sudanese society.The paper finds that:there are clear environmental and ecological determinants of the conflictthe Nile River system created a natural division leading to the polarisation of African-Arab identitiesthe government has manipulated this advantage to its benefit, and the violence arising out of the disunity of the southern movement has played into its handsthe population in the contested border zones - the Abyei Dinka, the Nuba, and perhaps Shilluk to the west - that has suffered most directly from the warthe beneficiaries of the war are the elites on both sides who camouflage their struggle to control critical natural resources through ideologies of identity and resistancethe most valuable of these commodities by far is the Bentiu oil.The paper identifies specific areas for policy and legal reform, and these are:decentralisation of significant economic and political powers to lower levels of governmentcommunity empowerment over land and natural resourceseconomic diversification in south Sudan to decrease dependence on subsistence productionequity as a guiding principle in allocating rights to land and resources, and the distribution of economic benefitsdevelopment of a comprehensive land and natural resource development and use plan through participatory, inclusive and public process. ;"P.

eldis:A35119;Water tenure reform and public access to water as a basic need;;"Access to water is a widely debated topic as water scarcity is looming large before several developing countries. The traditional approach of water as a public good is giving way to reforms which consider water as an economic good. This paper critically reviews legal and policy issues around the changing approach to appropriation and access to water. It identifies two major trends in reforms in water governance:

    water as a collective heritage of people not subject to ownership rights except where law recognises user rights and appropriation rights
    privatisation of water resources and management, with active encouragement by the World Bank. 

To elaborate on these two opposing, the paper presents case studies of water governance reforms in Quebec and Bolivia. While the reforms in Quebec have taken the rights approach to water, Bolivia has resorted to privatisation. Based on the lessons learned from these reforms, the paper argues that both these approaches are problematic. The collective ownership approach does recognise people’s right to water in line with the declaration of UN Committee on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights. However, it does not solve the problems faced by developing countries - lack of resources to provide equal access to water, exacerbated by scarcity of water. The privatisation approach discriminates against the poor as they cannot afford the high tariffs which are invariably associated with privatisation. The privatisation approach thus breaches the principles of equality, equal access and affordability. The paper concludes that two trends do not have to be mutually exclusive or contradictory. Recognition of water as a human right accords states with specific obligations with regard to its implementation. The states can then involve the private sector in giving effect to its obligation. However, the state must ensure that right to water is guaranteed on the basis of non-discrimination and prevent third parties from interfering with this right. Policy options include: 

    national governments should enact legislation recognising water as a fundamental right and ensure its provision on the basis of equality and non-discrimination
    privatisation need not be a closed option as long as decisions to do so are taken with the participation of the people to be potentially affected

eldis:A46620;Water rights for indigenous people in Mexico;;"Many water resources in Mexico run through indigenous areas. Mexican governments have often made management decisions on the basis of perceived economic needs, rather than concern for the people and ecosystems involved. This trend continues today, despite recent agreements with indigenous groups over water use.Up to 10 percent of Mexico’s population are indigenous
people. They are reliant on water resources running through their territories
and face major challenges as a result of government management policies. Research
published as part of a UNESCO series presents an overview of the challenges
facing indigenous peoples in Mexico as a result of government policies.
Mexican governments have traditionally sought to centralise
control of water resources and implement projects they see as beneficial to
national and corporate interests, such as irrigation and hydroelectricity
projects. The recent dams on the Usumacinta River indicate that the situation
has not improved since the election in 2000, despite
agreements against such developments (such as the San Andres agreement), backed
by a large coalition of indigenous groups.
Successive governments have progressively taken control of
water resources away from local authorities and given power to federal
officials in the National Water Commission. These officials do not listen to those
people who best understand the rivers, springs, lakes and aquifers – the
indigenous peoples and other communities who live in these territories. The
watershed councils formed a decade ago are weak and implement management rules erratically.
More importantly, they do not represent indigenous people either.
Indigenous peoples face several challenges from water
development projects:
They often lack a water supply and sanitation
services. In 2000, 42 percent of indigenous homes had no piped water and 70
percent had no sanitation services.
The water resources they use are
contaminated, for example through the irrigation of the Mezquital valley with
sewage from Mexico City.
There is continuing forced relocation of
indigenous and rural populations to make way for big dams for irrigation or
hydropower, such as in the Miguel Alemán and Cerro de Oro dams. This threatens
livelihoods, cultural bonds, archaeological sites and biodiversity.
There is no forum for indigenous peoples to
express their interests: watershed councils have proven wholly inadequate.
The legal mechanisms to claim rights over
territory are weak and indirect, especially when opposed by powerful companies
with ties to federal governments.
Depriving indigenous people access to water and involvement
in water resources management not only violates their rights, but also neglects
a vital source of traditional knowledge. To guarantee respect for indigenous
water rights, the author recommends working in three directions:
adopting a legal framework that fully recognises
the rights of indigenous peoples
including legitimate indigenous representatives
on water management bodies in the territories in which they live
forming social
coalitions amongst indigenous peoples and other rural populations so they can
better express their opposition to policies backed by powerful companies and
officials.

eldis:A36892;Transparency in oil rich economies;;"
Corruption is a serious problem in many developing countries that are rich in oil and other natural resources. This is central in explaining why resource rich countries perform badly in terms of socioeconomic development. Transparency has recently been viewed as a key factor in reducing corruption and other dysfunctions in natural resource rich countries. The paper addresses the relationship between transparency and corruption, with an emphasis on oil rich countries. It provides a systematic overview of the available literature and arguments on transparency and corruption before reviewing the literature on information, corruption and development, in a resource rich context. Finally, using the case of Angola, the report focuses on some of the main corruption related problems caused by limited access to information. It also looks at the approach of current transparency initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). In general the paper finds that transparency, or access to information, can have an effect on corruption. Transparency can reduce bureaucratic corruption by making corrupt acts more risky, by making it easier to provide good incentives to public officials, and by easing the selection of honest and efficient people for public service. Transparency can reduce political corruption by helping make politicians more accountable to the public.  ";"I. Kolstad

eldis:A75991;Rethinking the consultation-conflict link: lessons from Bolivia’s gas sector;;"This paper shows that consultations do not only appease conflicts, but also exacerbate them as these procedures are used to negotiate broader grievances. The author further argues that narrow consultations (like those carried out in Bolivia) – rather than comprehensive ones – repress conflicts in the short term by limiting opportunities to mobilize against extractive projects. It also reveals that the degree of conflict and prevention potential of consultations varied according to the affected groups and highlights the ambiguous effects of the entanglement of consultations and compensations.

Countries where this step is relevant include Sudan, Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Iraqoutside governments should also invest in training and capacity building on natural resource wealth management issues both for diplomats and for governments/officials, media, and civil society in the resource-rich countriesoutside governments should explore the possibilities of discouraging governments and commercial banks from financing governments that do not meet agreed standards for natural resource wealth management.

eldis:A23914;Pushing beyond earth's limits;;"World grain production is a basic indicator of overall food security at the global level. Since 1984, world grain production has expanded more slowly than the world’s population. By the early years of the 21st century, consumption has outstripped production. Could these trends herald a new ""politics of scarcity""?In this article, the author sets out the evidence for his assertion that the world faces a future food security crisis.First, based on current trends, demand for grain will increase significantly over the coming years. It is predicted that the world’s population will grow by 3 billion over the next half-century. Furthermore, rising standards of living in some of the world’s most populous countries, such as India and China, are likely to see a shift towards consumption of more expensive – and more grain-intensive – foods, such as livestock.At the same time, however, the supply of grain will simultaneously decrease. This will be primarily as a result of environmental stresses and industrialisation and growth. Climate change is contributing to soil erosion and desertification of large tracts of previously arable grain-producing lands, while rises in temperature are predicted to reduce harvest yields. is reducing the world’s supply of water for irrigation. At the same time, as world demand for food has tripled, so too has the use of water for irrigation. Many major water tables that have been used to irrigate land are falling; water tables are now falling in countries that are home to more than half of the world’s people, including China, India, and the United States—the three largest grain producers.Economic growth has seen the loss of grain-growing land to non-farm uses such as housing and industry, and a shift of populations from rural to urban areas. Greater affluence has also resulted in a the conversion of land from grain production to the cultivation of more profitable agricultural produce such as vegetables and fruits.Rising food prices could be the first economic indicator to signal serious trouble in the deteriorating relationship between the global economy and the earth’s ecosystem. If these trends continue, the author warns, food insecurity may soon become the overriding concern of national governments.The chapter is taken from Lester R. Brown, Outgrowing the Earth: The Food Security Challenge in an Age of Falling Water Tables and Rising Temperatures (NY: W.W. Norton & Co., 2005) ";L.R.

eldis:A36005;In control of natural wealth? governing the resource conflict dynamic;;"This paper tests the impact of resource governance on the resource-conflict dynamic. It examines the impact of resource type, abundance and dependence on risk and duration of violent conflict, whilst also exploring the importance of the governance of natural resources in preventing or overcoming the resource-curse. It is argued that for many developing countries, the extraction of natural resources has been a blessing, as their export can provide urgently needed development capital. For others, however, resource wealth has been a curse, as their population still faces extreme poverty and they have been haunted by corruption, government failure and violent conflict. The paper confirms that good governance can effectively contribute to the prevention of resource-related conflict and help alleviate the results of the resource curse on poor developing countries. It further argues that steps currently under-way internationally to boost the governance of natural resources are encouraging in that it will be possible to break the resource-conflict trap and improve the living conditions for those in most need. Key conclusions include that: 

    the relationship between natural resources and violent conflict is shaped to a large extent by the quality of the governance of those resources, which in turn is a correlate of good governance in general 
    resource abundance as well as resource dependence positively correlate with both the risk and the duration of violent conflict 
    strengthening governance is a concrete measure the international community must take to reverse the resource curse and build peace and development 
    effectiveness of resource governance can be improved through the development of measures to reduce corruption as well as the transparent management of revenues for purposes of sustainable and diversified development.

eldis:A38145;Sustainable forest standards in relation to small timber growers: lessons from KwaZulu Natal;;"This policy paper sets out the relevance of social and environmental standards for small-scale timber growers. It focuses on the development of the National Forest Standards currently being developed by the South African Government . The paper points out that the significance of small-scale timber growers in South Africa is likely to grow: Approximately one third of its timber production in the near future may be derived from small growers.  A key concern for growers is access to markets, especially where growers are not members of out-grower schemes or marketing cooperatives. Nevertheless, the potential for income generation through forestry, despite the risks, is such that there are an ever increasing number of new small growers entering forestry. Key policy conclusions highlighted include: 

    International and national forest standards have the potential to exclude small-scale timber growers from markets, but this outcome is not inevitable 
    small-scale growers should be involved in the process of designing standards to ensure they are not excluded 
    many criteria for sustainable forest management do not make sense at the individual small grower level and it is necessary to identify an appropriate local institutional level at which they can be applied. 
    if small grower communities are to have a realistic chance of meeting standards and thereby contribute to sustainable forest management, direct assistance is required to develop co-operatives and build capacity and appropriate training to increase growers’ awareness of forest standards.

eldis:A101927;Tribal representation & local  land governance in India: A case study from the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya;;In India, the Schedule Tribes have remained on the fringes of growth, but less so in the majority tribal areas of the North East. This has increased the interest in the Sixth Schedule, the special constitutional provision relating to these areas, recognising the tribal communities’ rights of ownership and control over their land and natural resources. These communities have the advantage of protective provisions against ‘external threats’ from the state or private actors, compared to their tribal counterparts in other areas.  This article presents a case study of the socio-political dynamics of community ownership and control of land in the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. It shows how land loss and marginalisation of families occurred in relation with a state-led township project around the capital Shillong, bringing interesting perspectives to the debates on land management in this Sixth Schedule region. The study indicates, firstly: that land alienation, displacement and socio-economic marginalisation affects vulnerable people in the tribal communities, despite the constitutional protection. Community land control does not in itself ensure protection for individuals against land alienation and marginalisation. Secondly: Land alienation and marginalisation can gain impetus through “external threats”, including development initiatives by the state. However, displacements are also driven by intra-community land alienations. Thirdly: The Sixth Schedule aimed to protect and preserve the tribal communities’ way of life and was primarily a ‘settlement’ between the Indian state and particular social groups. Individual social justice would presumably flow from protection and preservation of the communities’ own social justice mechanisms. Communal land holdings are one such tribal social security convention that has been assumed to serve the cause of social justice. However, with time, and the influences of modern communications and the market economy, the communities are becoming more heterogeneous, which also challenges the ‘tribal ethics’ of land relations. ;K.N.

It focuses on the impact of these policies on Tibetan herders from a human rights perspective and based on its findings puts together a number of recommendations to international donors, the United Nations (UN) and the Peoples republic of China. Since 2000, the Chinese government has been implementing resettlement, land confiscation, and fencing policies in pastoral areas inhabited primarily by Tibetans, drastically curtailing their livelihood. Many Tibetan herders have been required to slaughter most of their livestock and move into newly built housing colonies in or near towns, abandoning their traditional way of life. Key recommendations include: 

    the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) should impose a moratorium on all resettlements until a review mechanism can be established 
     international donors must ensure that funds lent for development projects in the areas described in this report are not resulting in forced resettlement 
    the human rights Council and the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should raise questions about China’s policy of forced resettlement 
    the Chinese and international infrastructure companies investing in Tibetan areas should adopt explicit policies supporting human rights and establish procedures to ensure the involvement in projects, doesn’t contribute to human rights abuses.

eldis:A39916;Rights-based approaches to forest conservation;;"In context of the recent emergence of the debate on rights-based approaches (RBA) to conservation, this paper provides a collaborative piece of work on the constitution of RBA’s and some of the key issues surrounding them. It also looks at some examples from countries where there is a need for RBA’s. The editors explain that the need for conservation to recognise the rights of those people who are most directly impacted by global conservation initiatives makes rights-based thinking not only a question of ethics and social justice but also a practical imperative for saving species and ecosystems. A rights-based approach is not about fulfilling a utopian dream of people and nature living in perfect harmony. When individuals and communities have rights over an area, they may act to safeguard some of its conservation values; however,  they will only do so if the right incentives are in place. It is asserted that there is no guarantee that people will exercise their rights in ways that preserve the ‘non-instrumental’ values, such as species diversity, that conservationists are particularly concerned about. Contributors to this paper write on a number of areas and raise numerous key points. These include:

    forest restoration, rights and power in the Ngitili forests of Shinyanga: while various reforms in Tanzania have encouraged the large-scale restoration of small woodlands, poor women explain that wealthy men were rapidly acquiring land for private ngitili forests for grazing their cattle, and too little land was being set aside for the needs of poorer users 
    Colombia’s new forest law rejected: Colombia’s Constitutional court ruled that the country’s General Forestry Law, enacted two years ago, was unconstitutional. This move follows an intensive campaign by a coalition of campaigners and legal experts and representatives of forest communities who opposed the law on the grounds that it violated the rights of Indigenous People and Afro-Colombians

eldis:A39445;Future forestry education. Responding to expanding societal needs;;"Forestry education in recent years has largely failed to adequately respond to the dynamics in forestry practice, the demands of the job market and the challenges of new global forestry paradigms. 
This policy brief consolidates recommendations of the first global workshop on forestry education held in September 2007, at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) in Nairobi, Kenya. Attended by 85 participants from 29 countries representing Africa, Asia, North and South America and Europe, the workshop deliberated on vital issues for guiding, coordinating and linking relevant institutions and stakeholders in the process of transforming forestry education. They agreed that: 

    increased investment in forestry capacity is imperative 
    improved coordination mechanisms are key at national, regional and global scales to reinforce the quality and content of forestry education and training 
    enhanced harmonisation of forestry with other related sectors is needed in order to achieve synergy of strategies and actions 
    regional and global mechanisms for collaboration in forestry education be established and sustained 

The brief asserts that major changes in forestry education, research and practice are urgently needed to improve relevance and popularise forest science, technologies and practices. Obvious implications for neglecting forestry education are noted as:  

    schools of forestry will continue to produce inadequate graduates, lacking the required expertise to handle the emerging complex societal and environmental challenges 
    forestry professional ethics could deteriorate further, leading to indiscriminate destruction of natural resources the backbone of human livelihood 
    due to the link between agriculture and forestry, the destruction of forests may lead to water flow challenges impacting on food security
    our knowledge and capacity to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change will remain weak, further accelerating global warming, flash floods and droughts 
    further losses of biodiversity will deny the world of important plants and animals with the potential to solve health and other problems

eldis:A22323;Independent forest monitoring in Honduras;;This report summarises the results of a monitoring and evaluation project of Independent Forest Monitoring (IFM) in Honduras. The project’s aim was to analyse institutional basis for an IFM system in Honduras, which could  be accomplished by developing working relationships with the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR), other governmental institutions, civil society and the private sector.The report draws several conclusions:there is interest by the forest authorities in implementing more effective control missionscorruption among forest authority personnel is due to a lack of incentives coupled with the high value of logged timbercooperation between the Independent Forest Monitoring (IFM) and the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR) has been ad hoc.  In order to develop more effective coordination of efforts, the establishment of more formal mechanisms such as a Memorandum of Understanding must be developedoperators who are committed to working within the law usually have difficulty knowing what is required. This is due to the arbitrary manner in which some aspects of forest legislation is interpreted.The report makes several recommendations to the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR), including the following:the administration must draw up a Memorandum of Understanding with the Monitor that clearly expresses the objectives and protocols of the projectHeads of Project Implementation Unites (UEPs), regional offices and the Department of Technical and Environmental Auditing of AFE-COHDEFOR (DATA) must be instructed to follow up field inspections carried out by the monitor in a more responsive and prompt mannerit is important to ensure that the Monitor, together with other relevant government agencies, can carry out its work without risk to its integrity, providing support personnel when necessary and not allowing any persons threatening the monitor to continue to do so with impunity.The report also makes some recommendations for government’s action:ensure that AFE-COHDEFOR (or any new forest institution if established) is provided with the financial, technical, logistical and human resources to guarantee that the institution can transparently and efficiently apply the lawprioritise the sustainable use of natural resources by local populations in forest policies. ;;;Global Witness;eldis;01/01/2006;en;"environment;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"HND;419";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A22323;http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/274/Second%20Summary%20Report.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalwitness.org%2Fmedia_library_get.php%2F274%2FSecond%2520Summary%2520Report.pdf;;;;"Labelling and Certification Forest Certification;Corporate Social Responsibility;Environment and Forestry;Environment;Labelling and certification;forest;Extractive industries;independent forest monitoring;timber"
eldis:A70639;The state of land use management in South Africa;;"In contemporary South Africa, land use management may be considered to be a crucial, but weak link in the transformative project attempted by the overall land management system, and planning activity in general. Land use management is increasingly recognised to have been a neglected area of engagement, and this neglect has had significant consequences.

In this paper, the background section briefly locates land use management within broader land and planning activities. The paper then describes the rationality and nature of the current land use management approach in South Africa. The third section discusses a number of key issues raised when considering LUM from a second economy perspective, and elaborates on the consequences of these issues. These issues have a strong metropolitan bias due to the nature of the source information. The last part of the paper draws out the implications of the discussion when considering interventions in urban areas.

eldis:A75458;Farmland utilization and improvements for agricultural production infrastructure: farmland consolidation;;"Farmland consolidation is the act of consolidating a series of fragmented and irregular farmland plots to enlarge plot their size and support sufficient irrigation. Farmland consolidation also combines and groups the proprietor’s farmland into one area by administrative give-and-take as well as division-and-junction of their land. Moreover, it also includes the rearrangement of farmland, which is small or lacks sufficient infrastructure due to farmland consolidation or earthwork waterways projects that were done in the past. Such areas can be reconsolidated into a larger scale production by employing farm machinery.

This study is intended not only to investigate the process, achievement, and outcomes of the Farmland Consolidation Project, which has been constantly implemented since the late
1960’s, but also to draw out the implications of these findings.

eldis:A26723;Economic and social components of migration in two regions of Southern Province, Zambia;;"Paper addresses the migration process in the Zambia's Southern Province. Until recently when droughts and cattle diseases have begun to plague the area, Southern Province was known for its ideal farming conditions. Monze district has been home to vast expanses of commercial farming, as well as  smaller ""emergent farms"" and subsistence farmers, all of whom have benefitted  from good soils and climate, and easy access to markets on the line of rail.  The Gwembe Valley, which lies south east and 2000 feet below Monze district,  is also part of Southern Province. However, environmental and geographical  conditions have limited the Gwembe people's ability to feed themselves  consistently, let alone engage in regular cash cropping.  In both places,  migration to frontier farming areas where soils are fertile and rain is  plentiful is one option for improving a person's ability to farm successfully.  This is not to say that migration is a recent phenomenon. As the section on  Zambia's internal migration patterns demonstrates, mobile populations are part  of Zambia's history. However, as populations in a given area grow and soil  fertility declines over time through repeated use, access to suitable farming  lands becomes limited. Migration becomes an outlet for those people lacking  land of sufficient size and fertility.  While the economic incentive to migrate seems apparent, there are many other issues to consider. In this article I raise the issue of social networks in home villages as they relate to resource access. What makes one man migrate and another in the same village remain at home? Through data collected in two different studies, we see the importance of social links and local power relations in determining who has access to which resources, including land and farming implements. The social dynamic between father and son often causes a son to loose access to his father's cattle and plow, with no local alternative for farming his own field. Scrambling for land upon the death of an elder often leaves at least one relative landless. Both of these situations can lead to an individual migrating to a frontier farming area where he has relatives and perhaps better access to farming resources. Following the methodology section introducing the two migration studies on which this article is based, I give a brief history of internal migration in Zambia as background to the current movement patterns found in Southern Province. In discussing migration patterns from the Gwembe Valley and Monze area specifically, I highlight the fluidity of the migration process as well as demographic characteristics of migrant populations. Each region has unique characteristics which influence migrants' decisions. In the section on causes for migration I highlight the social component of many migrants' moves. Problems of drought and poor economy are often the final  straw for a young man who has struggled to gain enough land or cattle to farm in his parents village. This last straw is then simply a kick to force a  decision which has been brewing for years. In the final section I discuss the link between migrants and their relatives at home. Rarely is this link based on altruistic notions of family support and cooperation; instead it is a dynamic relationship negotiated at each end by individuals struggling to have their needs met.

eldis:A74057;Spoils of oil? Assessing and mitigating the risks of corruption in Lebanon’s emerging offshore petroleum sector;;"To be fully prepared for Lebanon’s possible transformation into a major oil and gas producer, the risks of corruption in connection to its nascent petroleum sector need to be better understood and addressed. Given Lebanon’s dismal track record in countering corruption and its chronically gridlocked political process, the risks of corruption in the country’s nascent petroleum sector are significant.
This paper tracks such risks along the value chain of the country’s expected petroleum production and in the context of revenue management and expenditure. It argues that the first steps in petroleum governance have been encouraging but are far from optimal. Sources of concern pertain to the Lebanese Petroleum Administration’s mandate and relative insulation from political interference, sub-optimal transparency in the pre-qualification process, the envisaged non-disclosure of exploration and production agreements, and the questionable assumption that sub-contracting for offshore petroleum activities will be largely self-regulating. In addition, a range of state institutions and agencies that will be crucial to daily petroleum governance are unlikely to cope if not drastically reformed.
Looking further ahead, this paper touches on a number of policy choices that will have to be made if or when Lebanon’s petroleum reserves are confirmed, including the establishment of a national oil company, determining the role and management of a ‘sovereign fund’, and considering more radical proposals for petroleum revenue expenditure and sharing. It concludes by arguing that a lively and informed national debate on the specificities and technicalities of Lebanon’s petroleum sector may help to create the very prerequisites of political change and create more favorable conditions to counter the risks of corruption.

eldis:A39115;Corruption and forest revenues in Papua;;"This paper notes that under a sustainable, well-managed, logging regime, Papua – the most densely forested part of Indonesia – can potentially contribute substantial forest revenues for socio-economic development. Yet, it remains the poorest region in the country, in part due to widespread corruption involving public and private actors.The paper argues that, reforming the management of these resources – specifically, introducing accountability and transparency into the collection of forest revenues – is a key precondition for welfare improvements in the region. The relationship between forest products actually produced and resulting government revenues must be clearly established if the proper financial resources are to be made available for poverty alleviation.The paper makes the following recommendations to the Indonesioan government and to international donors:To Indonesian authorities:

    the government – at national, provincial, and district level – should address corruption in forest revenues through specific changes to the current revenue management system
    the Ministry of Finance should introduce a proper accounting system for the payment of forestry fees and produce an annual financial report that includes a forestry revenue report
    the Supreme Audit Board should verify the adequacy of this forest revenue accounting system and provide an audit opinion on the adequacy of forest revenues
    the Ministry of Finance should become actively involved in the control of wood production via its control of the payment of forestry fees
    law enforcement agencies (particularly the Indonesian Anti-Corruption Commission) should begin active investigations at all levels of the forest revenue management system 

To Donors:

    support the implementation of an Integrated Law Enforcement Approach (ILEA) to the Indonesian forestry sector
    provide capacity building assistance for government agencies involved in implementing ILEA
    provide technology to government agencies and civil society actors involved in monitoring logging activities in remote forest areas
    provide technical assistance to government agencies for producing credible financial and timber production reports

eldis:A37844;Gender and natural resource management: livelihoods, mobility and interventions;;"This book examines the gender dimensions of natural resource exploitation and management, with a focus on Asia. It explores the uneasy negotiations between theory, policy, and practice that are often evident within the realm of gender, environment, and natural resource management. It offers a critical feminist perspective on gender relations and natural resource management in the context of contemporary policy concerns: decentralized governance, the elimination of poverty, and the mainstreaming of gender.The book is centred around three themes:

    the changing global context with which approaches to gender and environment must engage, particularly changes associated with neo-liberalism
    the ways 'gender' has been incorporated in environment and development practices, especially within interventions designed to accomplish sustainable development goals
    the realm of gender, knowledge and authority, and how gendered subjectivities problematise simplistic mappings of gendered agency and environmental actions.

The book combines conceptual argument with empirical material from a variety of political, economic and ecological contexts across Asia, including Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. In different ways, the authors explore how gender subjectivities, ideologies and identities are produced, employed and contested within natural resource governance, and how gender discourses shape exclusions and possibilities within environment/development processes. The book is intended as a core resource for students of gender studies and natural resource management, and as supplementary reading for a wide range of disciplines including geography, environmental studies, sociology, and development. It also provides a stimulating collection of ideas for professionals looking to incorporate gender issues within their practice in sustainable development. ";"B., P. Resurreccion

eldis:A25206;Current issues in cattle pricing and marketing in Botswana;;Botswana's meat export parastatal, the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC), has been much in the local news. Cattle suppliers have become accustomed to substantial annual producer price increases from this successful national industry, which has expanded increasingly into European markets. But at the end of 1984 it was announced that there would be no bonus paid and no price increase for 1985. This was later changed to a small 5% price increase, following producer pressure. Then followed allegations of managerial extravagance and corruption, voiced in the National Assembly, and the sudden retirement of the executive chairman.These notes look at some of the principal issues in cattle pricing and marketing in Botswana which underlie the present concern  namely the recent performance of BMC, the proposed Francistown abattoir, the impact of the growing domestic beef market and the organization of cattle supplies to BMC. The conclusion reached is that cattle pricing is likely to be an increasingly controversial issue in the near future as BMC struggles with the two opposing goals of capacity expansion and cost reduction, and government struggles with the equally conflicting goals of retaining high producer prices while putting the cattle industry onto an increasingly cost covering basis. ;"M.

eldis:A67812;Climate change and natural resources conflicts in Africa;;"Africa is among the most likely vulnerable regions of the world that are to be negatively impacted by climate change. The continent’s vulnerability to climate change arises from a combination of many factors, including extreme poverty, high rate of population increase, frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods, and agricultural systems that are heavily dependent on rainfall. Under-development in some African states has also been a function of existing protracted natural resource conflicts and climate change worsens the situation. Climate change is a major threat to livelihood security in Africa.

This monograph encompasses papers from different disciplines and draws case studies from across Africa. It covers a range of issues relating to vulnerabilities, adaptation and mitigation of climate change and conflict management. Information provided in this monograph is expected to form the basis for decision makers across Africa to formulate and implement appropriate policies to curb the impacts of climate change.

eldis:A63009;Enhancing resilience in the Horn of Africa: an exploration into alternative investment options;;"This discussion paper seeks to explore alternative investment options with the aim of enhancing resilience in the Horn of Africa. Climate change, conflict, drought and increasing populations are leading many to pessimistic conclusions regarding the future viability of pastoral farming, arguing that these livelihoods should be sedentarised and diversified. Simultaneously, others argue for their wholesale protection. This paper argues that both economic theory and the existing evidence base points to the need for a balanced development strategy involving both inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral development, as well as cross-cutting transformations of the demographic, social and political structure of the arid and semiarid lowlands (ASAL). After providing a contextual understanding of livelihoods in the region, the paper discusses economic transformation as a guiding principle. It then describes the scope for both non-livestock and livestock development strategies in the ASAL regions. Despite the concerns, pastoral farming is actually an efficient and resilient adaptation strategy to the environment when compared to non-irrigated non-pastoral farming. Increasing demand and livestock prices also offer reasons to modernise and support pastoral farming as part of a balanced investment strategy.There are key knowledge gaps that must be addressed before the question of how to balance investments can be resolved:

    the stresses on the carrying capacity of the environment and the interrelated resilience to shocks associated with varying of different human and livestock populations;
    the feasibility and potential of irrigation projects;
    the cost-effectiveness and time frame of interventions in each agricultural sector, as well as in cross-cutting interventions in education, social policy, microfinance, development etc.; and 
    the potential for regional and inter-regional migration and non-farm diversification.

A number of innovative service delivery mechanisms are suggested, including:

    the diverse and extensive uses that mobile telephones offer, e.g. in trade, microfinance and health;
    mobile and long-distance learning, and boarding schools;
    improved early warning systems (another potential use of mobile phones);
    weather-based index insurance; and
    improved infrastructure and access to relevant services linked to output markets via livestock development clusters.

eldis:A43472;A golden opportunity?: how Tanzania is failing to benefit from gold mining;;"This report analyses how Tanzania is failing to use its considerable mineral resources to tackle poverty, and asks: where is Tanzania’s mineral wealth going?  Gold mining is the fastest growing sector of Tanzania’s economy. Minerals now account for nearly half the country’s exports and Tanzania is Africa’s third largest gold producer. Yet ordinary Tanzanians are not benefi ting from this boom both because the government has implemented tax laws that are overly favourable to multinational mining companies and because of the practices of these companies.This report identifies three severe problems, namely:

    the government is receiving very low tax revenues from gold mining 
    gold mining is subject to minimal governmental or popular democratic scrutiny and is widely perceived to suffer from the associated problem of corruption
    people in the gold mining areas are failing to significantly benefit, and many are being made poorer.

The authors argue that major policy changes are needed, including:

    Tanzania’s mining law should be amended to ensure that the national economy, and Tanzanians, benefit much more from gold mining. No new mining contracts should be signed until this reform has taken place
    large donors, such as the British government and the World Bank, must champion this agenda. This will require pressure and monitoring from civil society organisations in Tanzania and internationally
    existing mining contracts must be made public and subject to parliamentary scrutiny

eldis:A70334;Myths and mining: the reality of resource governance in Africa;;"In Africa, mining activities are undertaken by private foreign entities, which pay taxes to the state. However, mining activities are not contributing as much as they should to national economies. Despite the increase in productivity and profits, the real benefits of mining have yet to be felt by the majority of the people, especially mining communities. Many factors – including the negotiation of dubious mining contracts by politicians with no real experience in the sector, keeping contracts secrets , lack of transparency by both mining companies and governments, tax evasion, transfer pricing and corruption – have contributed to reducing the amount of revenue that goes to governments and is therefore available to support critical socio-economic development programmes.

As this report argues, unsurprisingly, many people are asking how there can be two such conflicting realities. And in particular they are asking about the exploitation and export of the region’s mineral resources. They want to know what governments are doing with the revenues that they collect from the commercialisation of these minerals – and why natural riches do not seem to translate into a reduction in poverty. And another question that comes up time and again is – how have other nations managed to use their minerals to successfully build their societies and diversify their economies?

The author argues that it is clear that drastic changes are necessary – and that there is now a chance that real change can now happen. The African Mining Vision has finally produced a charter that all African countries can use to improve the governance of their natural resources – to start to transform the mining sector so that it benefits everyone not just foreign mining companies and local elites. But to achieve change, countries need to strengthen those institutions that are essential to controlling, directing and overseeing the mining sector. In particular, parliaments need to be given the skills and knowledge to perform their role better. It is not a ‘silver bullet’ since other work also needs to be done – to build capacity of civil society and local community groups, to root out corruption, to make companies adhere to international best practices – but boosting the ability of parliaments to oversee the mining sector would go a long way towards improving governance of this critical sector.

eldis:A67362;Enhancing the governance of Africa’s oil sector;;"Empirical studies have shown that oil-dependent countries are more likely to suffer from civil wars motivated by ‘grievances’ or ‘greed’ — and this is particularly true for states in sub-Saharan Africa.

This paper evaluates several important international governance initiatives in the African oil sector, including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Publish What You Pay, Transparency International and Global Witness.  What are the lessons we can learn from their successes and failures? Is there really a resource curse? Why does it hit some countries harder than others? Case studies of eight African oil-rent-dependent states (Angola, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria and Sudan) are tabulated for comparative analysis. These are followed by several two variable correlations of oil-rent dependency (independent variable), which analyse poverty, corruption, governance and violence (dependent variables). In conclusion, various moral lessons are drawn concerning the present-day realities of the oil-governance initiatives.

eldis:A67363;Forest governance in Africa;;"Although difficult to calculate systematically, forests play a significant economic role at the continental, regional, national and local levels in Africa. This paper sets out to provide an overview of key forest governance issues across the African continent. It focuses particularly on the experiences in western, central and, to a lesser extent, eastern subregions of the continent. Particular emphasis is given to the divergence between the forest as a provider of means to rural people and governance mechanisms that have predominantly focused on national economic activities and political priorities. 

The paper considers where the forests are, the main differences among them, their main uses and value to African people, and the main changes in their extent and condition. It summarises some of the key features and issues concerning African forest ownership and user rights. It considers issues and challenges around the state of knowledge of the continent’s forests, describing several ‘forest paradigms’ that have played an important role in setting the current, or emerging, context for forest governance. The role of some of the key stakeholders in forest governance systems is considered, firstly addressing the ‘problem’ of local stakeholders, and then providing several short case studies of how political intervention by senior decision makers, or outright corruption and graft, have both undermined proper governance and marginalised other stakeholders. Recent trends in the development of forest policies and legal frameworks are described, and the key issue of the decentralisation of forest governance is discussed.

eldis:A14671;Resource curse or not: a question of appropriability;;This paper explores the impact of natural resources on development. It uses new data on natural resources to show that, contrary to the popular ‘resource curse’ hypothesis, resource abundance in itself is not negative for a country’s economy. It argues that whether natural resources are good or bad for a country’s development depends crucially on the interaction between institutional setting and the type of resources that the country possesses.Findings include:some natural resources are for economical and technical reasons more likely to cause problems such as rent-seeking and conflicts than others: these are ‘technically appropriable’ resourcesthis potential problem can be countered by good institutional quality, which renders theses resources less ‘institutionally appropriable’mineral rich countries are cursed only if they have low quality institutions, while the curse is reversed if institutions are good enoughthis trend is even more stark for countries rich in diamonds and precious metalsas resources become less technically appropriable, the relative importance of institutions is predicted to be less decisive.[adapted from author] ;"A.D.

eldis:A67494;Natural resource governance, boom and bust: the case of Kolwezi in the DRC;;"Mineral extraction is the main source of employment and income in, Kolwezi, a city that has been tied since its inception to the
fortunes of Congolese copper and cobalt mining and the intertwined narrative of trends in international copper and cobalt supply, demand and price.

This paper considers the effects of the successive booms and busts in the mining industry and the commodity markets on the management of natural resources in Kolwezi. It focuses on the commodities boom that ran from 2004–2008, and the bust that began in 2008, which appears, at the time of writing, early 2009, to be far from its conclusion. Field research conducted in November 2008 revealed that the booms and busts of commodity markets and the mining industry have presented not only severe challenges for natural resource governance in Kolwezi, but opportunities for reform. Yet, as has been well documented, the modern Congolese state exhibits weak capacity to manage any aspects of the country’s mineral wealth. It remains dangerously ill-equipped to respond to either the opportunities or the challenges.

eldis:A37663;Maximising the contributions of local enterprises to the supply chain of oil, gas & mining projects in low income countries;;"A publication from Engineers Against Poverty for the extractive industries - an eight-page briefing note to guide oil, gas and mining (OGM) companies on how they can maximise the contribution of local enterprises to the supply chain of their projects in low income countries. It provides practical guidance on three major opportunity areas to increase local enterprise participation in project supply chains:

    modifying procurement policies and processes
    modifying contract documentation
    supporting the efficacy of supplier development programs

The briefing note, which contains six case studies from industry, draws on EAP’s expertise in contractor management, social development and procurement. In particular it highlights key lessons from EAP’s on-going research collaboration with the Institution of Civil Engineers, which is investigating how social objectives can be delivered through procurement processes.The quantity of investment in OGM projects in developing countries over the next twenty years is likely to be much greater than total international aid flows. If this investment is designed and managed to maximise sustainable economic opportunities for local communities, it can make a major contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in many countries.Involving local businesses and especially small and medium enterprises in the project supply chain is a crucial part of this opportunity because of the vital role these businesses play in promoting job creation and distributing the benefits of economic development more widely.

This CMI Insight focuses on the key conflict dimensions since the Mexican revolution (1910-1917) and up till today. The analysis highlights how the relationship between peasants and the army has changed from one of tentative mutual understanding in the post-revolution period to one in which the army increasingly acts as an oppressive agent; on behalf of powerful interests within its own ranks at first, and then on behalf of the Mexican state and private economic interests.

eldis:A42794;Rice land grabs undermine food sovereignty in Africa;;In the wake of the 2008 global food crisis, African capitals have been buzzing with renewed talk of the need for food self-sufficiency, and rice is often at the top of government agendas. Although everyone agrees on the need to increase production, the solutions coming out of the corridors of power boil down to the old formula of getting more fertilizers and “high-yielding” seeds to farmers. In the eyes of the decision-makers, this inevitably means either Chinese hybrid rice seeds or the Nerica rice seeds developed by the African Rice Centre, and backed by the most powerful donors and research institutes operating on the continent. The traditional knowledge and seeds of African farmers, which feed and provide livelihoods for the majority of people on the continent, are completely ignored.This report gives an example from Mali, which like several other countries in West Africa, recently went from being a net rice exporter to being a major importer. The government embarked on a multimillion dollar national rice initiative that was supposed to restore self-sufficiency by helping the country’s farmers to produce more. Unfortunately, this was done by handing over an enormous tract of prime rice land to an external investment fund and companies. The report concludes that while most African governments are proclaiming their commitments to food self-sufficiency, they are signing an alarming number of deals with foreign investors behind the backs of their people that give these investors control over their countries’ most important agricultural lands, including areas allocated for rice. These forces are threatening to take away the seeds and lands of small-scale food producers – the very basis of their capacity to feed people and to assure their livelihoods. ;;;GRAIN;eldis;01/01/2009;en;"food security;land grabs;land";Land & Food Security;;202;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A42794;http://www.grain.org/articles_files/atg-19-en.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grain.org%2Farticles_files%2Fatg-19-en.pdf;;;;"Agricultural biodiversity and natural resource management;Agriculture and food;Food security;agricultural lands;Africa;Soil and land management;Role of agriculture in development;food crisis;Land issues;Mali;national rice initiative"

eldis:A21546;Trade and conflict;;This report examines the theoretical underpinnings of trade and conflict, and lays out the debate on how free trade affects conflict. In order to do so it examines the political economy of violence and how globalisation has factored into recent international and internal armed conflicts.The report highlights different theoretical approaches:the classic neo-liberal argument is that increased international trade makes conflict too costly, and thus countries that participate in trade are more likely to be peaceful other theories leaning on the  neo-liberal argument argue that trade reduces conflict, but only when trade is symmetrical between countries or when countries trade in certain kinds of goodsdependency theorists argue that trade patterns between core (industrialised) countries and periphery (unindustrialised) countries deepen existing inequalities and provoke international conflict.The report also highlights that countries that trade in natural resources are more prone to internal conflict than countries that trade in manufactured goods, with the risk of conflict increasing when a country relies on natural resources for 30% or more of its GDP.The problem with this high-level of dependence on natural resources is two-fold: first, the inequitable manner in which natural resources are extracted and traded tends to create tensions between the economic elite and the local populationsecond, natural resources provide ripe economic opportunities for repressive governments and violent rebels to finance themselves during conflict episodes.The report argues that while making money has always been part of making war, now making money has become the ultimate end, which means that the point is not to win the war, resolve the conflict, and return to peace, but rather to feed the wartime economy. In that context globalisation has contributed to a number of factors making it easier to fuel war time economies. These include open global markets for selling illegally extracted resources, unethical foreign companies willing to buy illegal concessions, bargain with rebels, or cooperate with a corrupt and repressive regime, and a free flow of small arms from other countries. ;;;Center for International Development, Harvard University;eldis;01/01/2005;en;extractive industries;;;;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A21546;http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/features/tradeconflict.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cid.harvard.edu%2Fcidtrade%2Ffeatures%2Ftradeconflict.pdf;;;;"war economies;Conflict and security;Stakeholders in conflict;Business;trade theories;Trade Policy;Trade Liberalisation;climate change as driver of conflict;Business and conflict;trade and conflict;Extractive industries;extractive industries;Liberalisation Impacts;Corporate Social Responsibility;Drivers of conflict"
eldis:A16778;Sustainable development in mineral economies: the example of Botswana;;"Mineral wealth often detracts from, rather than enhances, the economic performance of developing countries, a phenomenon known as the “resource curse”.  The need to finance basic government expenditure, as well as rent-seeking behaviour by individuals and interest groups, puts pressure on developing country governments to spend mineral revenues rather than reinvest them.  Consequently the depletion of minerals is not offset by a compensating increase in other forms of capital.Botswana, however, has consistently reinvested most of its mineral revenues in accordance with criteria aimed at sustainability and increasing the stock of physical and human capital, and has a long-term framework for setting policy.This paper reviews Botswana’s economic sustainability over the past 20 years, using environmental accounts to assess the value of mineral assets.  It compares Botswana’s performance to the rule that the total amount of capital (including mineral assets and net foreign financial assets) should be maintained at the same level.  It also analyses the process by which mineral revenues have been transformed into other forms of wealth and attempts to draw conclusions about the management of mineral resources.Its findings include: Botswana’s Sustainable Budget Index (SBI), a policy rule requiring that all mineral revenues be reinvested, has worked well in the past but may be less useful for the future not all of public sector investment has been productive, and a better allocation of mineral revenues might improve the sustainability of the economy the SBI was not based on an objective with a well-defined target, such as a given percentage increase in per capita GDP; consequently, there were no criteria for allocation of mineral revenues, or for evaluating a given allocation HIV/AIDS has further complicated the problem of efficiently allocating public investment funds, since it has lowered the productivity of much of the public infrastructure and made higher health spending necessary simply to maintain current human capital. Its suggestions for policy include: as productivity of public investments in Botswana diminishes, it could consider establishing a permanent fund for distributing mineral revenues directly to citizens use of well-defined targets for policy, in order to optimise allocation of mineral revenues among alternative investments, and between current and future consumption the country’s 6-year National Development Plans address medium-term objectives, but there is a need to move towards longer term planning for investment strategy.

eldis:A23817;Awareness raising workshop on the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification;;This paper presents the proceedings of a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) held in December 2005. The report presents the workshop programme, objectives and methodology. Four papers were presented at the workshop, ensuing discussions by the participants are also included. The papers discuss:desertification as the foremost environmental issue in Sudanthe history, objectives, principles and importance of the UNCCDSudan’s National Action Plan (NAP) and implementation mechanismthe integration and linkages between UNCCD/NAP with Sudan’s development policies and programmes.Four working groups discussed:identification of the role and commitments of the national parliamentarians establishing the implementation mechanism of the NCCD/NAPintegration of the NAP in Sudan’s development strategies, policies and programmesto set time frames for the revision and finalisation of the NAP, establishment of the implementation mechanism, and integration of the NAP in Sudan’s development strategies.The document concludes that the workshop was a breakthrough in that it was the first time that legal and political representatives were engaged to support efforts for combating desertification in the Sudan. The workshop strongly recommended the finalisation of the NAP to counter desertification and the creation of an enabling environment for its implementation and follow-up through strong political and financial support. The workshop also emphasised the critical roles of all stakeholders, in particular civil society organisations and local communities, in implementing the NAP through partnerships, as well as the crucial need for raising awareness at all levels about the UNCCD and the NAP. ;"A.A.

eldis:A13573;Natural resources, development models and sustainable development;;This paper starts from the optimistic assumption that the policies required for environmentally sustainable economic development are known but difficulties surround their implementation. The paper argues that in the low-income countries differences in the natural resource endowment are an important and hitherto neglected cause of tardy environmental policy improvements. This is because the primary sector remains large relative to GDP in such countries so that the scale and socio-economic linkages generated by the natural resource rents condition the aims of governments in important ways.Most developing countries are resource-rich and natural resource abundance tends to foster predatory political states that use the rents to relax market discipline and buy political support, distorting their economies in the process so that competitive economic diversification falters and growth collapses. Recovery is protracted and may take generations to accomplish. Meanwhile, macro policy failure damages micro policies, including those aimed at environmental improvement, by distorting prices and incentives, depressing genuine saving rates and shortening time horizons to secure immediate survival.The author concludes that environmental policy makers and their advisers can benefit from a fuller awareness of how macro policy failure adversely impacts on environmental policies. They need to adapt environmental policies to the macroeconomic limitations and to recognise that some past policies may have failed because of those limitations rather than through systemic flaws in the policies themselves. He argues that they also need to be more supportive of the efforts of the IFIs to ease the constraint of maladroit macroeconomic management. The strengthening of sanctions against anti-social governance can help here. This will improve the design of sound environmental policies guided by total economic value to price in externalities, green accounting to achieve positive genuine saving, and cost-effective pollution abatement measures. In this way, developing countries can leapfrog the environmental learning curve of the advanced economies and limit the mismanagement of natural resources and minimise the damage to environmental services.

eldis:A11921;The great water robbery;;Water is a precious resource and nowadays it is becoming more and more limited. In order to cope with this situation, privatisation of water services has been promoted and it is has become a compulsory precondition for developing countries, who want to access World Bank and IMF’ s funds for water and sanitation programmes.This paper compares two contrasting views:water is a basic human right that every state should guarantee to its citizenswater is an economic  good –a commodity – that should be governed by market forces The main consequence of water services privatisation is that water will become a privilege only of those who can pay high prices, by excluding a priori the poor. Empirical evidence suggests that generally water privatisation in developing countries has been led by foreign multinational companies. In addition, although a privatised water industry could lead to an increased efficiency, it should be taken into account that it needs an effective regulation, which is not a common characteristic in developing countries.Therefore, the paper concludes that the responsibility for water services should rest with governments and the democratic and accountable system of governance is a prerequisite for equitable approach to water services. ;G.

eldis:A14092;Governing the grasslands of Western China;;The paper begins by outlining Chinese grassland policy in the reform period and then describes key aspects of actual local level arrangements for grassland management. This description is based on the authors’ field studies at different sites on the Tibetan plateau (within Sichuan and Yunnan Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region) and Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Region1. A considerable difference between grassland policy and local-level arrangements is found, and the next section justifies these arrangements in terms of the social, ecological and economic context. The case is put that although the existing forms of community based management are not without problems, institutional change should be based on their  improvement, and the results of a pilot programme in Gansu Province is used to illustrate this. Finally, recent developments in the legislative framework for grassland tenure are examined.The paper concludes that given the social and ecological context of pastoralism in western China, the continuation of collective and group tenure arrangements and, more broadly, community-based management, is appropriate. However key aspects of grassland policy in the reform period that have not been consistent with this context have failed to be implemented on the ground. The  introduction of new land related laws and revision of old ones, offers an opportunity to afford de facto institutional arrangements greater formal legitimacy. Whether this is seized remains to be seen. The best possible outcome is if reforms provide local space for institutional innovation, thus potentially enabling institutional change in a direction that preserves the benefits, and addresses the problems, of existing arrangements.[adapted from authors] ;"T.

eldis:A100668;Traditional livelihoods and mining in Mongolia's changing climate: exploring the potential of cross-sectoral partnerships in achieving sustainability ;;"The growing scale of resource development activities accentuates the complexity underlying the sustainability of traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. At the same time, Mongolia experiences growing vulnerability to climatic variability and change, expressed in the form of intense desertification, water stress, and extreme dzuds. This paper is based on APN-funded capacity building workshops that focused on understanding a) how climatic changes impact herding and mining—although in varied forms, and b) how each sector may leverage its resources to devise action, strategies and tools that may help build capacities and boost resilience towards changing climatic conditions. Workshop discussions highlighted that traditional livelihoods remain under multiple threats from climatic variability and change; and institutionalised mechanisms of creating cross-sectoral partnerships - such as a network hub of key stakeholder groups - is fundamental in ensuring climate-resilient coexistence between mining and herding sectors.Highlights:this project was a first of its kind to discuss the complex links between livelihoods, the mining sector and climate change and natural disasters in Mongoliaa key focus of the project was brainstorming the idea of establishing a network hub of key actors that would value the strengths of individual sector groups and allow partnerships by identifying issues of common concerna clear highlight of the project is the greater appreciation of traditional herding knowledge and its indispensable role in natural disaster management and reliefmining industry in Mongolia is open to discussion centred around climate change and discussing its future implications on the sector. This is particularly noteworthy in light of a more reserved take on global warming internationally across the sectorAs a result of the finding of this study, policy recommendations are presented for five key areas:green development: the significance of green development at the local level is fundamental to guide changes in behaviour across Mongolia with regard to climate change, disaster management and resilience building. Workshop participants strongly advocated for stakeholder involvement in the development of a climate change policy framework at the local leveldisaster management: central government needs to build a better knowledge base on what forms a disaster, and disaster management and prevention plans, both for pre- and post-disasters. Investment in terms of obtaining best practices from national and international sources may help the process with better managing and addressing disastersmining and impacts of climate change: the mining sector in Mongolia is open to discussing potential impacts of climate change, climate variability and natural disasters on the mining sector. The sector is willing to embrace action to address climatic perturbations as there is an acceptance of a strong business case for the mining industry to take note of changing environmental conditions across Mongoliagreater recognition of traditional herding knowledge: Mongolia should further invest in studies that reaffirm the importance of herder movement, and its role in disaster management and maintaining pasture quality. Additionally, a systematic policy refocus to move attention from herd quantity to quality is essential in the country’s current policy landscape. Improved government funding may allow studies on genetic herd improvements and the importance of focusing on a balance herd compositionknowledge hub: an established avenue for stakeholder groups to come together, discuss common concerns, debate options and identify pathways forward is vital to Mongolia’s future sustainability. Until such time when legislative requirements call for cross-sectoral cooperation, a knowledge hub may help institutionalise the practice of nudging sectors that may have been in conflict thus far to cooperate and use consensus—not conflict—to ascertain solutions to common challenges ";;;Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research;eldis;01/01/2016;en;"environment;climate change;mining;natural disasters";Land, Climate change & Environment;;MNG;;http://www.eldis.org/document/A100668;http://www.apn-gcr.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CAF2014-CD04NSY-Sharma.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apn-gcr.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FCAF2014-CD04NSY-Sharma.pdf;;;;"Environment;Mining;Climate Change Adaptation;Environment and natural resource management;Climate change;natural disasters;Agriculture and food;climate change adaptation disaster risk reduction;public-private partnership;Climate and Development Knowledge Network;Pastoralism;traditional livelihoods"
eldis:A30074;Treasure or Trouble? Mining in developing countries;;This policy paper for the world bank addresses the question of whether countries consider their mineral wealth an asset, to be used to stimulate or enhance their economic growth potential, or are there reasons to steer an economy away from the development of the mineral sector?Reviewing the cases of 51 “mining countries” in the developing world, three conclusions can be drawn:First, in more cases than not, mining countries appear to fare better than other countries in their respective regions. Second, where they do fare well, their good performance appears to be associated mostly with institutional stability and overall good economic management, particularly that relating to the management of revenues from the mining sector and the management of the sector itself.Third, the need to build institutional stability and improve economic management is most urgent in countries where the mining sector dominates an economy and where poor economic management and weak institutions are persistent features.In contrast to some analyses, this paper finds no reason to assume a causal relationship between a dominant mining sector and overwhelming economic ills. Nonetheless, it acknowledges the need to take special steps to prevent vested interests from expropriating mining and mineral resources that could otherwise be used to create economic assets for future generations. To these ends, the paper emphasises the need for policymakers to design and strengthen general economic policies and institutions for financial management, as well as specific frameworks and institutions for the mining sector.The challenge the author identifies is to turn the national endowment of mineral resources into national wealth. In this regard, there are lessons to be learned for other mining countries from both the “worst of class”and “best of class” performers profiled in this study. [authors summary] ;M.

eldis:A75126;Property rights reform in Philippine agriculture: framework for analysis and review of recent experience;;"This paper constructs a framework for and reviews studies on property rights reforms in the agricultural and natural resources sector. In the case of agrarian reform, several hypotheses are posited: that agrarian reform will increase the rate of capital accumulation of beneficiaries and improve tenurial security, but may have negative impacts on land access, investments of landowners, and efficiency of land use. For the natural resources sector, the implications of open access and promotion of property rights are surveyed for the Philippine case. Overall, the review finds that research work is scanty and not clearly generalizable to the national level, even for such a major and longstanding program as agrarian reform. Future research thrusts are enumerated in terms of the issues and hypotheses identified in this review.

eldis:A20718;Winning the water wars: toward a watershed-based approach to watershed resources management: a policy agenda for local government units;;"Water governance in the Philippines is saddled by several problems. The failure to implement laws governing the watershed approach and the absence of institutional mechanisms has seriously undermined any effort to mainstream and integrate water and watershed plans and programmes into the activities of various agencies involved in water resources management and governance. This is compounded by the lack of appreciation of water as an economic good, which leads to the inability for market-based mechanisms to function.In this paper, the author argues the need to obtain wide support vis-à-vis the Local Government Units (LGUs) and civil society organisations in water management since local communities are directly involved and are usually the frontline consumers of environmental goods. The author believes that it is in the best interest of these local communities to be directly involved in how the water resources should be managed and receive the proper training to perform their role.The author offers the following as guiding principles in the involvement of LGUs in water resources management. LGU’s must:adopt an integrated and holistic approach in addressing the inherently interrelated issues of water supply planning and operation, demand management, pollution control, and watershed and ground water protectionmanage water not only as a social good but also more importantly as an economic goodimplement a strategy to operationalise a water-pricing policy that covers the full economic cost of water production and distribution, by taking into account the opportunity cost of water where there are competing users, and the cost of externalities or negative environmental impactsuphold the principles associated with a watershed-based approach by considering the watershed as the basic unit in managing the water resources of the country.The author also suggests that there is a need for mechanisms to enable LGUs to be effective managers of their water resources to:support for the institutionalisation of local water bodiescreate a technical capacity and awareness among the LGUs and local communities, particularly in managing watershedenable the financial viability and sustainability of local initiatives beyond their reliance on official development assistance.The author concludes the study by indicating that there is a need to put in place mechanisms that require local governments to involve civil society organisations. LGUs may not always be efficient and responsive at all times; in fact there is a need for the presence of strong social capital, strong organisational capacity, high political literacy, and strong capacity for informed and effective advocacy.  Hence, civil society organisations could become effective technical partners of local government units in water resources governance. ";A.P.

It asks whether CBNRM:devolves control over the resources to usersensures users participation in the design and implementation of policies and development initiativesleads to the adoption of sustainable use practices and control by those who use the resourcesleads to exercising democracy at lower levelskeeps away elites, or whether they are able to hijack the powersresults in different actors interacting differently in the processThe paper finds that:any major impact of CBNRM in improving livelihoods of the people is still a myththe process and pace of CBNRM is too slow to produce any short-term significant impactovercoming the constraints of the very limited rights in protected areas has to be achieved before the Derre community can expect any gains from participating in a CBNRM systemthere is a danger that devolution of power will be to the wrong level and to an unrepresentative entity, as local elites can easily hijack the processone route to increasing the benefits to local people has been the through joint ventures with private sector players, though the experience has been mixed, as has the functioning of local organisationsthe degree to which the emerging organisational arrangements are legitimate and inclusionary is questionable, as membership fees potentially exclude many poorer community membersThe paper concludes that:rights must be secured in an area of primary state jurisdictionthe community must become aware of their rights under the Forestry and Wildlife and Land laws in order to take the lead in forming an institution that truly represents themfinancially viable enterprises should be adopted in order to ensure long-term investmentthere are some policy gaps that have to be looked at regarding the rights of access for communities living in and around protected areasa rural development approach has to be adopted in order to change the household economy in Derrethe issue of community representation has to be resolved and the beneficiaries of income-generating activities should not be restricted to the members of the associationadequate land use planning is essential to avoid implementation of conflicting land uses such as harvesting forests for wood or for expansion of agricultural practices for cash crops and bee keeping ;"I.

eldis:A67066;On the margin: Kenya’s pastoralists. From displacement to solutions, a conceptual study on the internal displacement of pastoralists;;"Pastoralism is a global phenomenon. In Africa, where 66 per cent of is used for pastoral production, it is recognised as part of the continent’s cultural heritage. More than just a means of production, it is a way of life intrinsically linked to the identity of the individuals and communities that practise it. Given their traditionally nomadic lifestyle, the fact that pastoralists can become internally displaced is often overlooked. Some even question whether it can happen at all.
This study focuses on northern Kenya. It argues that their internal displacement is a reality that has to be understood within a broader discourse about mobility, and creates a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon by examining its multi-causality. In doing so, it also discusses processes and options for improving protection and assistance for those affected. Pastoralists’ internal displacement is presented as a process of impoverishment and decreasing resilience, which leads to the disenfranchisement of rights, marginalisation and neglect. As such, it is as much a human rights as a humanitarian and development concern that requires a holistic approach.

eldis:A72838;Valuing variability: new perspectives on climate resilient drylands development;;"This book is a challenge to those who see the drylands as naturally vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty. 

It argues that improving agricultural productivity in dryland environments is possible by working with climatic uncertainty rather than seeking to control it – a view that runs contrary to decade of development practice in arid and semi-arid lands.

Across China, Kenya and India – and most other dryland countries – family farmers and herders relate to the inherent variability of the drylands as a resource to be valued, rather than a problem to be avoided. 

By exploring these vibrant agricultural economies that take advantage of variability, this book inverts longstanding negative views about food security in the drylands.

eldis:A67063;Land Access and youth livelihood opportunities in Southern Ethiopia;;"This study aims to examine current land access and youth livelihood opportunities in Southern Ethiopia. Access to agricultural land is a constitutional right for rural residents of Ethiopia. We used survey data from the relatively land abundant districts of Oromia Region and from the land scarce districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ (SNNP) Region. We found that youth in the rural south have limited potential to obtain agricultural land that can be a basis for viable livelihood. The law prohibits the purchase and sale of land in Ethiopia. We found that land access through allocation from authorities is virtually nonexistent while land that can be obtained from parents through inheritance or gift is too small to establish a meaningful livelihood. The land rental market has restrictions, including on the number of years land can be rented out. Perhaps as a result of limited land access, the youth have turned their back on agriculture. Our study shows that only nine percent of youth in these rural areas plan to pursue farming. The majority are planning non-agricultural livelihoods. We also found a significant rural-urban migration among the youth and especially in areas with severe agricultural land scarcity. Our econometric analyses show that youth from families with larger land holding are less likely to choose non-agricultural livelihood as well as less likely to migrate to urban areas. We suggest here some measures to improve rural livelihood such as creation of non-farm employment opportunities and improvement of land rental markets. We also argue that as a certain level of rural-urban migration is unavoidable, investigating youth migration is essential to design policies that help the migrating youth as well as the host communities.

eldis:A75267;The establishment of Korea land information system (KLIS);;"The Korea Land Information System (KLIS) aims to provide information necessary for land policy establishment promptly and accurately. This system manages accurate information on land use zoning designated by land use regulations and provides it to government agencies, local governments, and people. KLIS manages and provides specifically the land information database to prevent duplication of investment among agencies and to effectively manage the land by securing the compatibility of data sets.

There were many difficulties during the construction process of KLIS. The first of these difficulties was to produce a serial cadastral map with single cadastral maps, because of different scales of cadastral map in the characteristics of land parcels. Secondly, there was a discrepancy in each different zoning map. Thirdly, the flawed legal system for data sharing in land policies and lastly, the central government experienced conflicts to initiate the KLIS incorporation. In spite of these challenges, the Korean government was able to establish the KLIS.

The KLIS performed better than anticipated and its effects were both tangible and intangible. Enhanced public services through the Internet have been welcomed by the public, and are helping to save time and costs. ";"Jong Taek Park

eldis:A101910;Can the land rental market facilitate smallholder commercialization? Evidence from northern Ethiopia;;The paper utilizes household panel data to investigate whether the land rental market can facilitate improved access to land for land-poor tenant households over time and thereby facilitate expansion of their farming activity. The paper utilizes data 8-17 years after land certification to assess the long-term effect of land certification on the allocative efficiency in the land rental market in areas where land certification stimulated land renting in the early years after certification. The paper uses three rounds of balanced panel data collected from 320 smallholder farmers in 2006, 2010 & 2015 from rural Tigrai, northern Ethiopia. Random effects dynamic probit and Tobit models were used to assess factors that may explain access, participation, and intensity of participation on the tenant side of the tenancy market. Tenants’ access to land was found to be severely constrained. Previous access and participation had strong positive effect on access and participation and intensity of participation in later periods. Non-convex transaction costs and entry barriers, therefore, appear as severe constraints towards the land rental market facilitating smallholder commercialization through tenancy access to land. More active land rental market coordination interventions are needed to boost the land rental market as a vehicle for facilitation of smallholder commercialization. ;"M. Gebru

eldis:A18145;Diamonds are forever, wars are not: is conflict bad for private firms?;;Using microeconomic data for Angola, this paper studies the relationship between civil war and private investment in a poor, resource abundant country. In order to do so, the paper focuses on diamond mining sector and conducts an event study on the sudden end of the conflict, marked by the death of the rebel movement leader in 2002.Findings of the study include:the stock market perceived this event as ‘bad news’ rather than ‘good news’ for companies holding concessions in Angola, as their abnormal returns declined by 4 percentage points this effect is sizeable and statistically significant, and is not likely to arise from unmeasured shocks to the diamond industry occurring at the same time, as the event had no effect on a control portfolio of otherwise similar diamond mining companies this finding is also affirmed  by other events and by the adoption of alternative methodologies: using nonparametric techniques with daily data on the intensity of conflict, finds that moderate level of violence increased the abnormal returns of the Angolan portfolio.The paper points out that results should be interpreted in the light of the widespread rent seeking in the Angolan mineral industry. The occupation of parts of the territory by the rebels and the instability created by civil war may limit the government’s ability to extract rents as well as the threat of entry of new firms, and thus be beneficial for incumbent companies. ;"M.

eldis:A22212;The local politics of land and water: case studies from the Mekong Delta;;This document takes a historical view of the relations between individual and collective actors in local water management in the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam. It identifies and analysis the genesis and operation of institutional arrangements, forms of organisation, rules, and standards and contracts regulating access to natural resources, in particular water and land, in a context of agrarian colonisation and progressive anchorage of the State.Emphasis is placed among other things on conflicts, why they emerged or did not emerge, the players involved, regulation modalities, and the role of the authorities in arbitrating disputes. The analysis of these process is done through an exploration and understanding of farming logics, changes and innovations in agricultural activity systems, and the insertion of forms of agriculture in a network of social and economic ties with entrepreneurs providing agricultural services. Beyond this, this document situates these analyses in the larger framework of the evolution of Vietnamese agricultural policies and evaluates their real weight in the various national ruptures in the local political economy (colonisation, Vietnam war, south-Vietnamese regimes, unification) and the decisive stages of the national agricultural policy and land tenure reform.The document is available for download from the GRET website in  3 separate parts. ;"P-Y.

The project encountered the following problems:a participatory community-based land use planning approach, worked initially but it was later found that this was inadequate to deal with the social realities and complexities of the regiontranshumant pastoralists were not representedsocial relations between groups were affecting the outcome of project activities in a way that the project was unable to understandmanagement of communal assets was problematicAs this approach was not successful a new set of strategies were adopted. These more successful strategies included:focusing on social groups rather than territorial units.  This entailed programme activities shifting towards facilitating consultation and collaboration among the different groups within the community, using participatory methodsacknowledging the role that historical processes played in causing local tensions and rivalries among the population in Kishi Beiga, thereby contributing to the breakdown in natural resource management systems.

eldis:A12177;Gender, water and poverty: key issues, government commitments and actions for sustainable development;;"Overview of the relationship between gender, poverty and water. The first section explores how, in every corner of the globe, women play a central role in managing water supply and distribution. It also examines how access to water and sanitation has implications for women’s health and economic activities. Case studies highlight water projects and initiatives that have succeeded in elevating women’s status.Section two presents strategies for translating government commitments on gender, poverty eradication and water and sanitation into action by advocating for a gender perspective in all water and sanitation related policies. As a fundamental component of sustainable development, water is a strong entry point for  global advocacy on connected issues such as human rights, economic justice, poverty, reproductive rights, land, health, HIV/AIDS, and energy. Also in this section, women experts put forth their own guidelines for integrating gender in water use and management for poverty eradication. Section three, in the form of an insert, is a compilation of existing government commitments on gender, poverty and  water—including the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002 Johannesburg, South Africa); the UN Millennium Summit (2000, New York, U.S.); the Fourth World Conference on Women (1995, Beijing, China); the International Conference on Population and Development, (1994, Cairo, Egypt); and global water  conferences. Advocates can use this matrix as a tool for  monitoring government action At the end of the paper is a list of websites, contacts and other resources that can be used to get involved. [author] ";"P.

eldis:A35706;Peri-urban water conflicts: supporting dialogue and negotiation;;"As cities expand, a key challenge is securing water supplies for urban populations and disposing of pollution while minimising impacts on peri-urban communities and the environment.  This book describes the conflicts, dialogues and negotiations underway in peri-urban areas of many cities in the South. 
Based on three case studies from Sao Paulo (Brazil), Cochabamba (Bolivia) and Chennai (India), it reveals how people and communities without good access to water and sanitation services depend upon alternatives to conventional service delivery from utilities, and explores how these arrangements can be supported. In particular, the case studies explore how stakeholders can be brought together to find better solutions to infrastructural development in peri-urban areas, and how research can provide information, tools and approaches to facilitate these processes. 
The research is based on the Negowat project, a four year research initiative undertaken by a consortium of research and non-governmental organisations from Europe, Latin America and India. 
The authors find that, there are several similarities as well as important differences across these three widely differing cities. They find that: 

    in each city, there are huge problems in service delivery to expanding populations in the peri-urban areas. These are probably insurmountable in the short term due to existing patterns of development in the cities
    in each case, however, innovative, locally-inspired and alternative solutions have emerged to fill the gaps in formal systems 
    sometimes these have clear overall benefits such as the generally well-performing community-managed water systems in Cochabamba, but sometimes they are associated with severe negative impacts, for example, the over-exploitation and inefficiencies associated with private water markets and tankering in Chennai 
    in the three case study processes, researcher-initiated and supported negotiation processes were found to contribute to the search for less painful, less conflictive or more inclusive urbanisation.

This review is intended to provide a broad background in the use of participatory mapping processes and the range of tools available to practitioners. It is not exhaustive but aims to give readers a greater appreciaion of how participatory mapping has involved from a relatively simplistic participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tool into a community of practice spanning a range of sophisticated technologies and processes. 
It draws on a number of examples from around the world, with special attention given to projects supported by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), as this organisation commissioned the review. However, it contains useful insights, lessons and pitfalls in both the processes and tools available for participatory mapping. 
This review provides: 

    An outline of what is involved in participatory mapping and participatory mapping applications
    A review of the effectiveness of range of participatory mapping tools such as hands-on mapping, using scale maps and images, 3-D models and geographic information systems (GIS)
    A look at best practices and processes with awareness of enabling/disabling environments, the role of development intermediaries, awareness of mapping impacts and the importance of processes

eldis:A68408;Climate change and sustainable water management in central Asia;;"This working paper explores adaptation options in Central Asia. It describes the results of research conducted by a technical assistance in Central Asia. The research combined field observations with satellite-based data and created models to demonstrate the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the Aral Sea Basin. The adaptation options explored can be summarised in three broad categories: 1) Expanding the supply of water available in the future, 2) Increasing the productivity of water and 3) Reducing future demand for water.

The paper argues that climate change will put additional challenges on decision makers to manage water resources in a beneficial way both to the environment and human life and that solutions are possible when decision makers act adequately, resources are available and actions are taken in common understanding of all countries.

eldis:A20542;Extracting transparency: the need for an International Financial Reporting Standard for the Extractive Industries;;In the light of an emerging International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for the extractive industries - which could give a significant boost to global efforts to better account for revenues from the extractive industries - this report argues that such standards should require upstream extractive industry operators to disclose revenue payments on a country-by-country basis.Country-by-country reporting, this report argues, are crucial in achieving greater transparency, and will allow for better informed decisions about companies engaged in the extractive sector. It will allow small and large shareholders including analysts and institutional investors, as well as other stakeholders, including governments and citizens, to know how much a company is earning and paying to governments in the different countries where it operates.

This will help to increase understanding of what resources are being generated by gold mining, who is profiting and how those profits are being spentmore stringent criteria that ensure respect for human rights and require consent from affected communities. Transparency of revenue payments should be a pre-requisite for all funding of mining projectsincreased demand from gold retailers and consumers that the gold is mined in accordance with the ""Golden Rules"", respecting the rights of communities and workers and minimising damage to the environment.

eldis:A15125;Conflicts in Joint Forest Management: cases from South Rajasthan, India;;Joint Forest Management (JFM) has been an important step for improving amangement and governance of forests in India. However, conflicts and conflict resolution arrangements in the JFM framework are one area where there is urgent need for attention. This paper attempts to bring out some of the major areas of conflict in the JFM arena based on the experience of the author while working in Udaipur on implementation of JFM projects in India.The author finds that:the question of who should decide on the patch of forest that is to be protected, whether communities themselves, the Forest Department, NGOs or a combination of thesesboundary conflicts between neighbouring villages/communities are the most commonly cited conflicts in JFMformalising rights over a particular patch of forest is invariably problematic, since the complex and elaborate customary use patterns are seldom mapped and addressed adequately before a patch of forest is brought under the ambit of JFMconflicts often surface between the three main players in JFM, the Forest Department, communities and the NGOs, as these three stakeholders do not perfectly share the objectives of JFM and the ways and means to achieve themthe issue of benefits sharing is a major potential flashpoint, and the timeframes within which benefits materialise can alter dramatically from one region to anotherthere are questions over whether partners in JFM are equally accountable to one anotherconflicts created by JFM at the village level itself need to be better understoodThe author concludes that understanding and articulating the realities of fragmentation within communities needs to be improved, along with the attitudes of various layers of forest bureaucracy and their respective interactions with the forests that are to be transformed from being an open access resource into a common property resource. The author suggests that the basic philosophy that should govern progress towards conflict-free joint management strategy would be based on ‘Domain-Consensus’, which would mean that every party is clear about and in agreement with the roles the other players would play in the whole arrangement. ;P.

eldis:A38681;Depopulating the Tibetan grasslands: national policies and perspectives for the future of Tibetan herders in Qinghai Province, China;;"Tibetan grasslands constitute one of the most important grazing ecosystems in the world and encompass the source areas of many major Asian rivers. While a variety of government policies have been applied in recent years to protect the ecology and biodiversity of China’s grasslands, there is growing concern that national and global economic considerations have overshadowed emerging conservation agendas. This article critically reviews several key policies affecting pastoralists, with special attention given to the Sanjiangyuan region of Qinghai Province. The document finds that since 2000, when the Western Development Strategy began, China and the world have come to recognize the global importance of the Tibetan plateau  region, both as a “water tower” and as a geographic region with a unique natural and cultural heritage. In practice, however, emphasis has been primarily on conservation matters, including the establishment in 2003 of the second  largest nature reserve in the world. In many instances, the socio-cultural impact has been dramatic, demanding much of local people including change/loss of livelihoods and breakdown of community ties.Specific impacts noted include:

    the  resettlement of villages has occurred as a result of the “Ecological Migration” policy, a dramatic attempt to protect	the ecology and biodiversity of the headwaters of the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong rivers
    a fairly rapid transition from a rural “nomadic” lifestyle toward the increased sedentarization has taken place following the “Four way scheme” to alleviate poverty in rural Qinghai. This has led to a decrease in seasonal mobility and flexibility within livestock management practices, essential components of  Tibetan nomadic pastoralism for centuries
    families have been asked to move off the grassland and to adopt new livelihoods in farming or to live in new towns, as part of the Western Development Strategy 
    the full application  in 2007 of the long-standing 9-year compulsory education law requires  all children between the ages of 7 and 11 to begin primary education, and complete 9 years of education.

Despite some benefits of these policies, the author argues that  the speed and apparent resolve with which such sociocultural and development transitions are being introduced in grassland areas raise the important question whether there is any other way by which so-called “sustainable development” (and biodiversity conservation) can come effectively to the Tibetan grasslands before all alternative doors are closed.The article proposes a contrasting and more people-centered approach to conservation and development, drawing on nearly 10 years’ experience of active collaboration with local communities, NGOs, and government authorities in the headwaters of the Yangtze River. Citing the success of the Yangtze River Headwaters Sustainable Development Project - a collaborative development project of Plateau Perspectives, the Upper Yangtze Organization, and the Government of Zhiduo County - it argues that a model for combining conservation and development through genuine community participation  could usefully be applied more widely in China’s grasslands, and possibly more generally throughout western China.

eldis:A40610;Future scenarios as a tool for collaboration in forest communities;;"This paper discusses how a participatory method to facilitate thinking about future scenarios can help change the way forest communities and local governments interact. It reviews a growing body of literature on future scenarios and shares first-hand experiences in forest communities in the northern Bolivian Amazon and the central provinces of Vietnam. This paper finds that under the right conditions, the use of future scenarios:

    allows forest communities to: collaborate more effectively with local governments, assume better responsibilities when given control over forests under devolution schemes and to become self-organised in order to benefit from the opportunities of communal control over forests
    helps communities to think about dependency, vulnerabilities and ways to prepare for the future. The methods develop organisational capacity and encourage internal democratic processes and planning. Community leaders become more vocal and assertive in meetings with local government, and marginalised groups within communities, such as women or the poorest segments, make their voices heard. 

However, the methods are less effective when facilitation skills are not available or where government or other interests are threatened by local constituents. Future scenarios are not without their pitfalls and do not work in all situations, but given the appropriate context they can create “break-through moments” that improve collaboration between communities and local officials. Key concluding points are:

    while forest devolution and government decentralisation trends in the tropics continue, forest communities are frequently unprepared for their new responsibilities and lack democratic decision making practices and capacity within their organisational structures 
    community forest management is viable only when communities can negotiate effectively with government, private enterprise and NGOs, and are accepted as equal partners in negotiations and decision making about the forest 
    future scenarios methods are promising means for assisting forest communities to find common ground, define collective interests, develop the skills and gain the experience they need to take proactive roles and benefit from forest devolution 
    participatory methods such as future scenarios alone are not sufficient to empower marginalised or remote communities, but they can help prepare communities for the challenges and opportunities of forest devolution.

eldis:A12351;Capitalizing on conflict: how logging and mining contribute to environmental destruction in Burma;;This paper presents information illustrating how trade in timber, gems, and gold is financing violent conflict, including widespread and gross human rights abuses, in Burma. It argues that although trade in these conflict goods accounts for a small percentage of the total global trade, it severely compromises human security and undermines socio-economic development, not only in Burma, but throughout the region.The paper presents two case studies of two zones where logging and mining are both widespread and the damage from these activities is severe.Findings include:cease-fire agreements signed between the late 1980s and early 1990s have dramatically expanded the area where businesses operatea host of abuses, from lack of participation of local communities to loss of livelihood and violence, are responsible for the deterioration of the environment and traditional cultural practicesthe conflict only exacerbates these problems and reinforces the downward spiral of suffering in the areas examinedboth case studies highlight the dilemmas cease-fire arrangements often pose for the local communities, which frequently find themselves caught between powerful and conflicting military and business interestslocal communities feel compelled to participate in the unsustainable exploitation of their own local resources, even though they know they are destroying the very ecosystems they depend upon to maintain their way of life. The other alternative (to stand aside and let outsiders do it and then be left with nothing)  is equally unpalatableThe paper concludes that the case studies are classic illustrations of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights, protection of the environment, peace and sustainable development.

eldis:A22499;Strengthening transparency in the oil sector in Cameroon: why does it matter?;;This paper analyses transparency issues in Cameroon's oil sector. It shows that, while substantial efforts have already been undertaken, continued action is necessary to strengthen transparency. The paper also identifies why and how transparency, especially in the fiscal area, matters for economic development and poverty reduction in Cameroon.The report highlights that if efforts to strengthen transparency are consistently pursued, economic and fiscal policymaking will be more effective, the business environment will improve, and more resources will be freed for investment in social sectors and basic infrastructure, thereby supporting economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in Cameroon.Recommended measures to increase transparency include:contractual information on the production-sharing agreements between governments and oil companies should be made public. If the authorities and the oil companies insist that contracts are confidential and should not be made public, they could at least publish key parameters to illustrate how oil resources are allocated between oil companies, the national oil company, and the governmentbudget transparency could be strengthened by the full and timely transfer of oil revenues to the treasury and gradually shifting to a classification by economic naturefacilitating further public scrutiny would contribute to changing public sentiment on government accountability. Steps in this direction include making the technical secretariat of the EITI committee fully operational quickly, proceeding with consultations with the private sector and civil society, and formulating and implementing a specific consensus-based action planimplementing the EITI principles, beyond the progress already made, would clearly indicate that Cameroon strives to comply fully with international standards on oil transparency. ;S.

eldis:A22917;The Western Sahara conflict: the role of natural resources in decolonization;;This collection of articles looks at the role of natural resources in Western Sahara and outlines the framework for Western Sahara’s independence from Morocco.There is no doubt that the question of the natural resources of Western Sahara such as fish, oil and phosphates has been the main reason for the interest in the area in question. As in so many places all over the globe the exploitation of natural resources including the job opportunities it creates for the occupiers makes states and people react selfishly and in conflict with international law.This report presents: a summary of the Western Sahara situation with comparisons with the similar case of Eastern Timor an up-to-date picture of the situation with regard to natural resources in Western Sahara, and the way in which exploitation is taking place at present the UN’s legal opinion on exploitation of the natural resources of a non-self-governing territory from 2002, emphasising that such exploitation is legal but should be to the benefit of the people of the territory the Swedish Foreign Policy on the Western Sahara Conflict a message from the President of the Intergroup on Western Sahara in the European Parliament The authors argue that the ruling of the UN should form the first stepping- stone towards a future enduring peace in the region which allows for self-determination for the whole of Western Sahara.

eldis:A67281;Towards understanding South Africa’s differing attitudes to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Open Governance Partnership;;"Recent figures from globally established indices reveal diverging perceptions about the state of transparency and corruption in South Africa.

This paper undertakes a critical assessment of the various motivations behind South Africa’s active participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), as a contrast to the country’s notable absence from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Indeed, although the South African government is one of the eight pioneering states to have officially launched the OGP on 20 September 2011, it is not a signatory to the EITI, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in 2013. How has the South African government justified its absence from the EITI so far, and what do these justifications mean for its participation in the OGP?

The paper focuses specifically on developments regarding access to information in South Africa – namely the Promotion of Access to Information Act – and their implications for the country’s attitudes towards global transparency initiatives. The paper also considers the ways in which the South African government’s discourses, practices and contrasting approaches vis-à-vis these two multilateral transparency frameworks hold relevance for access to information in the country’s extractive resource sector. It suggests that the South African government may be more responsive to EITI-membership appeals if it perceives that its aspirations as an emerging power, both regionally and globally, are better acknowledged.

eldis:A41148;Beyond tenure: rights based approaches to peoples and forests. Some lessons from the Forest Peoples Programme;;"Although the historical focus on tenure reforms has resulted in some important improvements in the livelihoods of forest communities, it has not prevented them from suffering social exclusion and impoverishment. Based on a review of 17 years of work with forest peoples in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by the Forest Peoples Programme, this paper explores the complexity of rights that need recognition if community-based livelihoods in forests are to be secured and well-being further improved.The case studies used in the paper illustrate the need for recognition of some the following rights of forest peoples, which in some countries do not exist:

        have free pursuit of the right to choose to market and/or commercialize forest products from their domains
        be protected from slavery, debt-bondage, and other slavery-like practices
        be given redress for and the restitution of illegally expropriated natural resources.

The paper ends by suggesting some steps of what forestry departments and development agencies need to do to make these rights operational. For forestry departments the recommendations include:

        invest sufficient time and resources into recognising land claims and resolving land conflicts, including processes for supporting community-led mapping
        ensure full transparency and public access to information in land and forest designation, licensing, and concession systems
        ensure the existence of national legislation that explicitly respects rights of indigenous peoples as set out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

For development agencies the recommendations include the following:

        support inclusive reviews of the national forest sector using a rights-based approach, with the aim of identifying practical steps to secure peoples’ rights
        support community-level trainings on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
        givetargeted direct support to community initiatives on forest management
        support initiatives for implementation of the right to free, prior, and informed consent through for example locally developed guides and third-party verification.

eldis:A70340;Land, biodiversity and the extractive industries in southern Africa. How effective are legal and institutional frameworks in protecting people and the environment?;;"In the natural resources sector, laws are often formulated to regulate the relationship between men and the environment. Ideally, the law can play a vital role in regulating and protecting communities from adverse environmental and social impacts of mining, loss of land, biodiversity and natural wealth, as well as other human rights violations. Almost all countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have developed laws and institutions to regulate and monitor the extraction of mineral resources and their impact on the environment and people. However, the level of implementation and enforcement of those laws varies across the region and in some cases legal gaps exist.

In light of this, the Southern Africa Resource Watch (SARW) commissioned research in three SADC countries – Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe – to assess the effectiveness of exiting legal and institutional frameworks governing land, social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector.

This policy brief analyses the findings of the three reports and identifies current legal and institutional frameworks in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana that seek to protect land, biodiversity and communities from the adverse impacts of mining. It highlights good practices while also capturing crosscutting weaknesses and gaps in the legal frameworks.

The policy brief also analyses the institutional capacities of responsible government departments, whose legal mandate is to monitor and hold mining companies accountable, and looks at the domestication and application of regional and international instruments. More importantly, the efficacy of voluntary practices and standards adopted by mining companies and financial institutions to promote social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector is also assessed.

eldis:A73544;Corporate social responsibility in South Africa’s mining industry: an assessment;;"The corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda has been a part of the global debate on socio-economic development for many decades. Countless claims have been made that CSR can contribute towards more inclusive development and the alleviation of poverty. This briefing examines the concept and role of CSR in the mining industry of South Africa. The mining case study reviewed here demonstrates that key implementation challenges are a lack of co-ordination and alignment with the government’s development plans, at both national and local level, coupled with weak monitoring and evaluation. Too frequently CSR programmes are centred on business-orientated objectives that are not fully integrated with broader, country-level development plans. This briefing highlights how the current CSR agenda and its practice may be unsuited to effectively addressing social problems and delivering socio-economic development plans in South Africa.
Recommendations:

    mining companies should think more critically about the relevance of CSR practice to their business. Enhancing ‘socially responsible investment’ should be central to their corporate strategy
    mining companies should work closely with nongovernmental organisations and civil society in order to ascertain context specific diagnoses of the social and development challenges facing near-mine communities
    there should be stronger engagement with and alignment between CSR practice and development policy frameworks such as the NDP 2030, LED plans and IDPs
    there should be consistent review, monitoring and evaluation of CSR programmes to ensure that they remain relevant and meet the objectives of delivering socio-economic development plans. This will place emphasis on the importance of ‘corporate accountability’ and ‘sustainable development’

eldis:A101099;How pro-poor are land rental markets in Ethiopia?;;"Land rental markets can potentially improve the access to land for land-poor households that possess complementary resources that can enable them to utilize land efficiently. Land rental markets can also enable landowners who are poor in non-land resources to rent out their land such that their land is utilized more efficiently and they themselves can get a better income and improved welfare from their land resource. This report assesses the land rental market that is dominated by a reverse tenancy system with relatively poorer landlords and less poor tenants. This market has largely developed informally in Ethiopia but has also been shaped by the changing land policies. We assess how pro-poor it is and whether interventions potentially can make it even more pro-poor and welfare enhancing or whether a “hands off” policy is preferable. If we can detect a significant market failure, there is room for intervention. However, there are also a number of current interventions in the market. We assess whether these achieve the intended outcomes or rather should be lifted or modified.Population growth, economic growth, and structural transformation in agriculture may change the role of land from being the most important safety net and livelihood opportunity to become an important resource for agricultural transformation and development. The non-farm sector in Ethiopia has grown rapidly in recent years and provides new employment opportunities and this reduces the pressure on land as the only and main source of livelihood. Our study of land rental markets in Ethiopia covers communities in Tigray, Oromia and SNNP regions focuses particularly on the period 2006 to 2012, but draws on data and research that goes back to 1998 in Tigray and utilizes information from landlords and tenants and other rural households with male and female representatives, local Land Administrative Committee (LAC) members and local conflict mediators with long experience in handling local land disputes.In this report, we review the relevant literature and fill important gaps in this literature. These gaps include a) the stated reasons of landlords and tenants for partner choice and contract choice in the land rental market and their attitudes and preferences regarding regulation and formalization of land rental contracts; b) we investigate land access of youth in the land rental market; c) we assesses how joint certification of husbands and wives has affected participation in the land rental market; and d) how increasing population pressure and land scarcity affects land access and the land rental market over time.

eldis:A64515;Impact of climate and land use changes on water and food security in Jordan: implications for transcending 'the tragedy of the commons';;Jordan is dominated by arid climate with limited arable land and water resources. This study focuses on crop production and water resources under trends of anticipated climate change and population growth to analyse how these affect water and food security in the country. It finds that recession of irrigated areas led to lesser food production and food security. Results indicate that climate change and population growth increase and intensify problems of water scarcity and food insecurity. The study underlines the need for adaptive measures to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on water resources and food security. It suggests that at decision-maker level the development of water resources to increase supply is a top priority. At the user level, adaptation measures should focus on managing the demand by increasing water use efficiency and the adoption of appropriate cropping patterns that consume less water and produce more food. ;J.

eldis:A100153;Land, biodiversity and extractive industries in southern Africa: How effective are legal and institutional frameworks in protecting people and the environment?;;In the natural resources sector, laws are often formulated to regulate the relationship between men and the environment. Ideally, the law can play a vital role in regulating and protecting communities from adverse environmental and social impacts of mining, loss of land, biodiversity and natural wealth, as well as other human rights violations. Almost all countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have developed laws and institutions to regulate and monitor the extraction of mineral resources and their impact on the environment and people. However, the level of implementation and enforcement of those laws varies across the region and in some cases legal gaps exist.In light of this, the Southern Africa Resource Watch (SARW) commissioned research in three SADC countries – Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe – to assess the effectiveness of exiting legal and institutional frameworks governing land, social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector. This policy brief analyses the findings of the three reports and identifies current legal and institutional frameworks in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana that seek to protect land, biodiversity and communities from the adverse impacts of mining. It highlights good practices while also capturing crosscutting weaknesses and gaps in the legal frameworks. The policy brief also analyses the institutional capacities of responsible government departments, whose legal mandate is to monitor and hold mining companies accountable, and looks at the domestication and application of regional and international instruments. More importantly, the efficacy of voluntary practices and standards adopted by mining companies and financial institutions to promote social and environmental accountability in the extractive sector is also assessed. ;;;Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa;eldis;01/01/2016;en;"environment;land;extractive industries";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"ZAF;BWA;ZWE";;http://www.eldis.org/document/A100153;http://www.osisa.org/sites/default/files/land_biodiversity_and_extractive_industries_in_southern_africa_1_0.pdf;http://ims.ids.ac.uk/thumbnail/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.osisa.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fland_biodiversity_and_extractive_industries_in_southern_africa_1_0.pdf;;;;"Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa;Environment;Corporate Social Responsibility;Conflict and security;Land issues;Good Governance;Governance;Agriculture and food;natural resources as driver of conflict;Extractive industries;Drivers of conflict;Environment and natural resource management"

eldis:A75989;Contestations over indigenous participation in Bolivia’s extractive industry: ideology, practices, and legal norms ;;"The participatory rights of indigenous peoples have been at the center of conflicts over resource extraction, which have recently increased in number and intensity across Latin America. Using comprehensive empirical data about the Guaraníes’ participation in Bolivia’s gas sector, this study finds that competing claims regarding territory, property, participation, and decision making provide important explanations for contestations over consultation practices and legal norms in the country.

It argues that the main conflicts can be explained by:


	the Bolivian state’s focus on directly affected communities and those with formally recognized land titles, something that clashes with the Guaraníes’ principle of “territorial integrity”
	the state’s conviction that it holds a monopoly over subsoil resources, and the limited rights to participation that it is willing to grant as a consequence, which the Guaraníes reject; and
	the dissonance between state customs and regulations and Guaraní uses and customs

eldis:A68227;What drives deforestation and what stops it? A meta-analysis of spatially explicit econometric studies;;"This paper presents a meta-analysis of what drives deforestation and what stops it. The researchers find that forests are more likely to be cleared where economic returns to agriculture and pasture are higher, either due to more favorable climatological and topographic conditions, or due to lower costs of clearing forest and transporting products to market. It is argued that timber activity, land tenure security, and community demographics do not show a consistent association with either higher or lower deforestation. Population is consistently associated with greater deforestation, and poverty is consistently associated with lower deforestation, but in both cases endogeneity makes a causal link difficult to infer. Promising approaches for stopping deforestation include reducing the intrusion of road networks into remote forested areas; targeting protected areas to regions where forests face higher threat and tying rural income support to the maintenance of forest resources through payments for ecosystem services.

eldis:A64351;Land grabs and fragile food systems: The role of globalization;;"IATP have consistently argued that trade agreements need to respect and promote human rights, not drive a process of globalisation that privileges commercial interests and pushes public interests aside. This paper concludes that the globalisation enshrined in the free trade and investment agreements of the 1990s and 2000s have led to yet another manifestation of commercial interests trampling human rights - namely land grabs. This paper is specifically focuses on two forces that IATP argue have contributed significantly to the problem: First, globalisation—more specifically, the deregulation of trade and foreign investment laws, which has greatly eased cross-border capital flows, relaxed the limits on foreign land ownership, and opened markets to agricultural imports. And second, the failures of the international trading system during the food price crisis of 2007-08, which eroded the confidence of food import–dependent countries in international markets as a reliable source of food and fed both speculative investment and investment in actual food production. This loss of confidence was compounded by climate change and the resulting destabilisation of weather patterns, which has resulted in less predictable agricultural production. 
Whilst investment in agriculture is welcomed the impact of land grabs has been overwhelmingly negative. They are associated with weak institutional capacity (and sometimes corruption) in the recipient country governments, as well as authoritarian governments in the investors’ home countries, making it hard to bring pressure there for better practices. The communities whose land is leased or bought are not adequately protected. Four linked policy shifts to create a more stable and transparent international food system are needed: 

    reformed trade rules that ensure export measures are subject to transparency and predictability requirements and that allow all countries policy space for food security policies
    publicly-managed grain reserves to dampen the effects of supply shocks
    readily accessible funding for the poorest food importers, which would be triggered automatically when prices increase sharply in international markets
    the development of strong national and international laws to govern investment in land, respecting the principles and guidelines set out in the Voluntary Guidelines on Land Tenure.

eldis:A75601;Brazil: no easy miracle increasing transparency and accountability in the extractive industries;;"Brazil’s consolidation as an emerging economy is not easily attributed to any political or economic miracle. Brazil has consciously adapted a large part of its commercial and financial strategy to changes in the global arena. As worldwide demand has grown for raw materials—especially for single-crop agriculture, oil and minerals—Brazil’s growing economy has become increasingly dependent on the export of commodities.

Mining and oil activities in Brazil are growing fast. Brazil is currently a major global player in the extractive industries, especially through Vale in mining and Petrobras in oil and gas. Rapid changes at the national level have not been accompanied by equally rapid policy developments to ensure access to public information, which would permit greater control over common resources and goods by the active global citizenry. New legislation for the mining and oil industries is being passed with little or no debate by Brazilian society.

As major companies such as Vale and Petrobras have strengthened Brazil’s position as one of the world’s leading oil and mineral exporters, there has been no forum for debate on the implications of this trend for health, environment, marine flora and fauna, employment, or impacts on life in affected communities. A debate on transparency and accountability is urgently needed in Brazil, together with the ability to imagine a different society, one that avoids the exclusion, marginalization and destruction of communities and nature.

Fortunately, there is an enormous network of social and political actors working on the issue: universities, NGOs, social movements and even agencies and institutes of government ministries. There is also a clear geographic focus for advocacy work: because Rio de Janeiro State and certain Amazonian states (Pará) have the largest volumes of oil and gas extraction, together they form a strategic area for work on extractive industries in Brazil. A strategy to increase transparency and accountability in Brazil’s extractive sector could begin with Petrobras and an international consortium of NGOs implementing the ISO 26000 international standard for social responsibility. This standard, together with the Social Balance Sheet developed by the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analyses, could serve as the foundation for a binding law for the entire extractive industry.

Brazil would benefit from the creation of a multi-stakeholder group that included civil society and corporations that could produce national reports on the extractive industries and social responsibility. Civil society initiatives should be strengthened, especially by forming common networks that can contribute to the creation of an overall strategic vision, both within Brazil and internationally—especially in connection with Africa and Latin America.

It would be useful to promote a political entity through which the Brazilian government could formulate transparency and accountability policies, creating mandatory reports on all overseas payments and projects by companies whose stock is listed on the stock exchange. And since the legislative debate is currently focused on the collection of revenue, it would be strategic to introduce transparency and accountability criteria into the debate on the mining code and royalties from oil extraction.

eldis:A64857;EITI and sustainable development: Lessons and new challenges for the Caspian region;;"The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is sparking renewed interest and debate on issues such as transparency of government – company contracts, reporting on revenues from natural resources by company and by project, and reporting on revenue expenditure. An overarching concern is how to ensure that revenue transparency ultimately leads to better sustainable-development outcomes, including socio-economic development, poverty reduction and environmentally responsible extractive-industry practices.This discussion paper highlights key issues and new challenges related to EITI implementation, as well as broader issues of transparency and good governance in the extractive industries.  The paper is based on a series of dialogues relating to transparency and good governance in the Caspian Sea Region:

    Azerbaijan – the first country globally to become EITI Compliant
    Kazakhstan – an EITI Candidate country seeking to become Compliant
    and Turkmenistan – which is not a signatory of EITI but has expressed some interest in learning about the initiative

Recommendations from the Caspian dialogues include the following:

    provide further strategic, administrative and technical support for disaggregated reporting of payments to governments (e.g. company-by- company and project-by-project)
    identify current and potential ways in which the EITI process can contribute to accountability and sustainability in host countries and support relevant research on these linkages
    develop guidance on good practice in sub-national reporting, and support pilot initiatives, such as reporting on public monitoring of community development spending
    prioritise capacity building as an essential part of the EITI agenda, especially for local government and CSOs at the sub-national level
    ensure clarity in new rules and procedures, to strengthen minimum requirements and avoid any ambiguity that allows too much flexibility in implementation
    develop self-evaluation criteria and processes for EITI, such as progress ranking among member countries, based on competitive and motivational indicators

eldis:A64581;Sustainable wetland management in the face of climate risks in Niger: the case of La Mare de Tabalak;;"The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) recently implemented climate risk management studies in seven countries. This report, commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme’s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, gives a detailed summary of efforts in a Niger wetland environment to conduct one such study, incorporating climate change with three key sectors: agriculture, livestock and water resources. A number of workshops, consultations, capacity building exercises and working group meetings preceded and comprised the studies' implementation, including interviews, focus groups, socioeconomic questionnaires, field surveys and hydrological modelling. The wetlands of La Mare de Tabalak were chosen as the study site for its social, cultural, economic and environmental importance, and its vulnerability to climate change. It also had data available and a closed water system; a large pond that would fill in the wet season providing a number of roles for the community. This report contextualises the study with a development and climate profile, and the climate risks and impacts for the specific wetland. It then describes the existing national institutions, policies and initiatives. The report highlights that coordinated action is imperative to protect the pond and the wider-basin. The following recommendations are provided: 

    promote diversification of revenue-generating activities
    create an ongoing system to monitor and survey environmental and socioeconomic conditions 
    environmental restoration must be accelerated to extend the lifespan of the pond and curb erosion and silting
    diversification of livelihoods requires continued support to ensure access to natural resources
    outreach, training and knowledge/technology sharing must all be used to build the capacity of actors at all levels
    governance is advised to finalise and adopt the national wetlands policy, and to consolidate efforts and develop synergies between this and existing policies. 

The report closes with a note on areas for further research, including the need for a gender analysis, a survey of the pond’s bathymetry curve, socioeconomic scenarios and the impact of reservoir infrastructure on sediment transport to the pond. ";"J. Dekens

eldis:A62775;Cities and flooding: a guide to integrated urban flood risk management for the 21st century;;Urban flooding poses a serious challenge to global development and the livelihoods of urban populations, particularly the residents of the rapidly expanding towns and cities in developing countries. Responding to this challenge requires efforts to improve policy makers understanding and ability to effectively manage existing and future risks. This guidebook provides operational guidance on how to manage the risk of floods in a transforming urban environment and climate. It argues for a strategic approach to managing flood risk, in which appropriate measures are identified, assessed, selected and integrated in a process that both involves and informs the full range of stakeholders. The guide presents 12 key principles for integrated urban flood risk management, illustrating key policy messages with over 50 case studies on management measures and procedures from across the world. ;A.

eldis:A35425;Water, land and people: a learning initiative implemented in Bolivia, Mali and India;;"This document reports on findings from learning groups relating to water management in Bolivia, India and Mali during 2005-2006. The groups analysed specific topics with the aim of improving the current and future development strategies of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). In each of the three countries, the learning group identified key topics to address – equity, empowerment and environmental sustainability were identified as cross-cutting issues. The learning process resulted in products that can be used as a resource base at different levels including local, national, policy and wider public. Key lessons include: 

    where there are changes on the use of land, conflicts occur due to water access when the systems are not planned with a multiple use vision 
    the availability of the water resource is integral to the development of women’s organisations – allowing the creation of substantial incomes for families and communities 
    it is time to shift focus from development to management of water resources by improving water management mechanisms to address competition for a finite resource such as groundwater. 

Whilst the ‘learning process’ demonstrated that: 

    story-telling is an innovative learning tool – it allowed participants to break out of the usual more formal setting, seeing complex issues from previously unperceived angles 
    the learning process is most effective and motivating if intermediate results are produced and immediately used as inputs for decision-making and in other learning initiatives 
    the stakeholders should own the learning process but this can only be achieved if they are involved right from the planning stage.

eldis:A44199;Why should mediators consider the economic dimensions of conflicts?;;"This paper summarises the case for greater consideration of the economic dimensions of conflicts in mediation processes – particularly those concerning natural resources. The author highlights the recent United Nations Environment Programme publication, From Conflict to Peace building – the Role of Natural Resources and the Environment as further evidence of the need for this inclusion. For instance the report finds that:

    40 per cent of all intrastate conflicts since 1960 have a link to natural resources
    less than a quarter of peace agreements for conflicts with links to natural resources address the management and governance of natural resources
    intrastate conflicts linked to natural resources are twice as likely to relapse within five years. 

The author then highlights a number of reasons why economic issues have been sidelined in the mediation process:

    mediators’ understandable focus on political and security-related issues
    a perception that economic issues are in any case best addressed after peace agreements
    the sensitivity of discussing the profit motives of parties directly and indirectly involved in the conflict. 

The paper then details a number of recommendations to address economic issues. These include:

    avoiding vested interests when choosing the mediators themselves
    mapping the warring parties’ economic agendas and alliances
    not apportioning natural resources as spoils of war 
    creating mechanisms to monitor economic issues post-agreement
    putting lootable natural resources out of reach.

eldis:A44197;Trading conflict for development: utilising the trade in minerals from eastern DR Congo for development;;"This paper relays that the renewed outbreak of violence in North Kivu in the second half of 2008 saw the long running insecurity in Eastern DR Congo become the top global news story for two weeks as another humanitarian crisis unfolded before the world. The intense media scrutiny resulted in a plethora of stakeholders working, as the authors assert, to portray the conflict in ways that best fitted their own agendas; in particular, the region’s mineral wealth was implicated as contributing in the violence. However, this report suggests that trade militarisation is a symptom of conflict rather than its cause, and therefore asks policy makers to address the real causes of insecurity in Eastern DR Congo. These are identified as the ubiquitous governance weaknesses, and the inability of the Congolese state to maintain the monopoly of violence. The report suggests that, instead of trying to ‘stop’ or ‘interrupt’ the minerals trade, formalising a large percentage of it would contribute to achieving long-term security. This is because, as the research states, that stopping or interrupting approaches are not only impossible to successfully implement in the context of Eastern DR Congo; they also have severe retarding effects on regional development. The paper profers different approaches to the intransigent DRC conflict. These include: 

    recognise and prioritise the principal impediments to trade reform and place them at the centre of reform initiatives 
    improve governance structures
    encourage formalisation through transparency in tax and customs declarations and by addressing operational difficulties of export regimes 
    frame reforms in the context of regional development 
    build a functioning national army in the DR Congo.

eldis:A33450;Conflicts between farmers and herders in north-western Mali;;"This report provides insight into the local management of conflict over natural resources between herders and farmers in north-western Mali. The study finds that social, economic and environmental change within the region has led to growing pressure on natural resources and a marked deterioration in relations between farmers and herders. The paper warns that because this conflict is based on ethnicity, there is potential for serious escalation. The paper discusses the following: 

    environmental and livelihood characteristics in north-western Mali 
    rules governing access to and use of natural resources 
    conflicts within and between communities 
    conflict management 

The paper recommends a number of measure that can be taken to improve natural resource management and conflict management in the area: 

    clearly defined areas should be designated for pastoral and agricultural use, taking account of inter-and intra-annual variations in the areas where natural resources are found 
    compliance with all the rules should be monitored, and fields and livestock watched over during the rainy season, with the backing of committees representing all sedentary groups 
    local conflict resolution mechanisms should be reinforced by involving all the protagonists in the damage assessment and subsequent negotiations while also involving mediators who are respected by all parties 
    identifying and promoting other forms of income could contribute to better management of the production imbalances characteristic of the region, and reduce competition between livestock owners over access to grazing and water.

eldis:A42802;Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD) - the link with wetlands;;"This paper summarises the importance of wetlands in relation to climate change and eaxmines their potential role in the measures for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) under the Kyoto Protocol. The links between REDD concepts and wetlands are explored for the following reasons:

    so that REDD proposals do not perpetuate a negative perception that forest are only important because of the carbon that they contain
    to highlight some comprehensive frameworks of international and national nature conservation and forestry legislation that could provide an entry point for REDD proposals
    to emphasise the need for REDD funds not to be focused solely on reducing emissions, but also to contribute to related initiatives such as the improvement of forest governance and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

The author advances the arguments below for expanding the definition of REDD concepts to include wetland ecosystems. 

    Some forests are also wetlands and such a form of synergy can exist between REDD and the Conventions on wetlands (Ramsar) and biodiversity (CBD).
    Given the high capacity of peatlands to store carbon compared to other soil types, there may be greater carbon benefit per dollar to give priority to forested wetlands in implementing schemes for REDD.
    Forest areas involved in REDD should be more viable in areas where there is better wetland conservation and river basin management.
    There has been substantial advocacy in recent years for considering the role of ecosystems other than forests in contributing to “avoided destruction and degradation” methods of reducing emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Peatlands and other wetlands have been acknowledged as obvious contender for integration into a post-2012 framework.
    Degradation and disturbance of naturally-functioning wetlands can be (and already is) a major cause of increased carbon emissions.
    Overall, the long-term positive effect of CO2 sequestration is greater than negative effect of methane emissions from wetlands.

The paper concludes that there is great scope for synergy and mutual reinforcement of REDD proposals and other international conventions such as the Ramsar Convention and the CBD. One angle would be to conceptualise some “wetland-REDD” mechanism that produces associated benefits for conservation of biodiversity. ";D.

eldis:A73476;Looking back, looking ahead : land, agriculture and society in East Africa : a festschrift for Kjell Havnevik;;"Professor Kjell Havnevik is retiring from the Nordic Africa Institute (NAI) in 2015. For four decades, he has carried out research, taught and supervised students as well as participated in policy debates on different aspects of agriculture, the environment and African and international development policies. His output has been voluminous and is internationally recognised. His academic record includes research and teaching positions at universities and research institutes in Tanzania, Norway and Sweden as well as shorter assignments in several other countries. Yet his intellectual home has over the last three decades been at the Nordic Africa Institute in Uppsala.
NAI has therefore taken this opportunity to publish a book mainly centred on development issues in Tanzania in the context of rural development in Africa – a theme that Kjell has pursued throughout his career. The book brings together research issues with which Kjell himself has been actively involved.
It is NAI's hope that this will be more than a traditional Festschrift, inasmuch as it includes reflections on the academic and wider intellectual debate on development issues from the 1970s until today.

eldis:A42148;From exclusion to ownership? challenges and opportunities in advancing forest tenure reform;;"In 2002, Forest Trends reported that in recent decades governments had begun to reduce their legal ownership and control of the world’s forests. This document evaluates whether this forest tenure transition continued in the 2002–2008 period, and assesses the implications of statutory forest tenure change for forest people, governments, and the global community. The report is based on the monitoring of governments’ data on formal and legal tenure by the Rights and Resources Initiative. The authors find that the transition did continue in the 2002–2008 period. The area of state ownership declined and there were corresponding increases in the area owned by communities and indigenous peoples. Progress is however slow. Some of the main problems faced include: 

    action on human, civil, political, and gender rights is also necessary to improve wellbeing but progress on this front is slow
    the area of industrial concessions still greatly exceeds the area of forest designated for use by, or owned by, communities and indigenous peoples
    industrial claims on forest lands are increasing sharply, for biofuels production among other reasons
    some governments are performing poorly in carrying out the reform process
    statutory reforms do not always result in more secure tenure. 

The report recommends specific roles that groups of stakeholders can play in advancing reforms. These include the following:

    governments can create and publicly disseminate strategies for implementing tenure reforms and establish, strengthen, and support independent judicial arbitration systems
    multilateral agencies and private sector entities investing in REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) strategies and carbon markets may become sources for complementary funding for accelerated reforms 
    forest-dependent peoples can self-organise and get involved in debating the pros and cons of REDD arrangements
    industries making investments on forest lands should take advantage of the opportunity to demonstrate support for and compliance with free and informed consent provisions
    forest management certifying bodies can take on board tenure and rights in their standards and consider certifying small and medium forest enterprises that are alternatives to the industrial model
    environmental NGOs can promote the creation of pro-poor systems of payments for ecosystem services.

eldis:A33515;Transparency and accountability in Africa’s extractive industries: the role of legislature;;"This report identifies the challenges that African legislators face in overseeing their countries’ oil and mining industries, as well as best practices in use around the world and recommendations for future engagement. The report finds that international organisations, local advocacy groups, and multinational corporations have played a key role in increasing public access to information and awareness in government oversight. Also, a growing number of African legislatures are more active in the management and oversight of the extractive sector. However, political and institutional constraints are the principal stumbling blocks to improved management and oversight of the extractive industries. Key recommendations include: 

    legislative bodies and Individual members should take advantage of international interest and support for increased transparency and accountability to develop more specialised knowledge and become more engaged in management and oversight issues 
    international advocacy groups and local civic activists and organisations should seek opportunities to work with legislative bodies, and promote legislative participation in extractive industry initiatives 
    members of the international community and the private sector should include legislative bodies and individual legislators in capacity building programs to improve extractive industry management and oversight

eldis:A101664;Integrated marine and coastal management in the western Indian Ocean: towards a sustainable oceans economy;;The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region has valuable and diverse coastal and marine resources, but much of its natural capital is either threatened or declining. The WIO encompasses rich diverse tropical and subtropical areas along the coastlines of Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa. This region also comprises vast oceanic areas and the island states of Madagascar, Seychelles, Comoros, Mauritius and Réunion. This paper focuses on the marine and coastal governance of mainland states in the region. As countries in the WIO region gear for a sustainable oceans economy, there is an urgent need for effective tools to ensure the resilience of coastal and marine biodiversity, to regulate sustainable resource use and to protect the livelihoods of millions of people. To achieve this, anticipatory approaches such as ecosystem-based, integrated resource management and coastal and marine spatial planning need to be used to promote sustainable Blue Economy pathways in the WIO, and facilitate the management of ecosystems and biodiversity in regional spatial planning. This essentially consists of designating and expanding effective marine protected areas (MPAs) and other priority areas for conservation, as well as including community-based models for sustainable management.This paper addresses some key governance challenges in the WIO region related to the inclusive management needed to ensure that resource management approaches, specifically in and around MPAs, produce outcomes for nature and for people. Key to their success is the ability to demonstrate and enhance socio-economic development benefits and to communicate these benefits through thorough economic valuations. Attention must focus not only on expanding protected areas’ coverage but also on enhancing the capacity of management agencies and communities to govern conservation spaces effectively and attract sustainable, long-term financing. Collaborative partnerships around the conservation and sustainable management of in-shore marine resourcescan significantly contribute to meeting the region’s national development targets, the AU’s Agenda 2063, the commitments set out in the 2030 global development agenda and the Aichi targets of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity. ;R.

eldis:A12149;Diamonds, forever or for good?: the economic impact of diamonds in South Africa;;This document considers the economic impact of diamonds in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. It states that the many global campaigns to stop trade in conflict diamonds has tended to ignore the benefits of the legitimate industry for these countries. The author describes a study that attempts to verify the claims regarding the positive aspects of the industry. This, it is argues, is important because concern about possible economic damage to these countries has caused NGOs campaigning against conflict diamonds to be less aggressive where consumers are concerned, than might otherwise have been the case.The paper provides some history of the industry in these three Southern African countries. It looks at the development of the trade in Botswana and the the economic benefits accruing to government there. Although these are significant, they do not seem to be significantly filtering down and reducing poverty. The author also points out that Botswana is not diversifying its income generation sufficiently away from diamonds, which are a finite resource. Similar analyses of the history and economics of the industry in Namibia and South Africa are presented.The author concludes that, with the exception of Botswana, diamonds contribute little to total government revenue in the region, and their contribution to employment in all three countries is small and declining. This means that diamonds cannot be identified very directly either with good development or its absence.However, the report defines some reasons for success and future priorities for improving benefits from the diamond industry:through good governance, management and control of supply, Botswana has managed to retain significant income from diamonds while retaining its political stabilitybenefits to local economies must be improvedthese three countries have benefited from the Kimberley process, developing new regulations, although evidence of conflict diamond trade in South Africa has to be better addressedultimately the responsibility for ending conflict diamond trade lies with the industry and with genuine corporate responsibility ;R.

eldis:A39870;Water and conflict: making water delivery conflict-sensitive in Uganda;;"Water projects have, arguably, the greatest potential to create conflict in development programmes. Not only is water central to health, sanitation and agrarian livelihoods but it can contribute to other conflict dynamics such as land or grazing rights. Applying conflict-sensitive programming to water projects, therefore, seeks to minimise the potential for fuelling conflict whilst looking to maximise the potential positive impact of the development. This paper details the experience of applying conflict-sensitivity to two water projects in Uganda. It highlights the lessons learnt and seeks to contribute to a broader understanding of how these approaches can be used by development actors. The authors detail a number of key lessons, including: 

    Conflict Sensitive Approaches (CSA) bring different benefits to different stakeholders - local government in the project areas saw it as a useful tool to improve the quality of community participation and ownership of the district-provided water and other services
    CSA can be a tool for deepening beneficiary participation - sufficient ‘space’ needs to be created for a wide variety of community members to air their views and to address their concerns as much as possible. This is vital to avoid the risk of dissatisfied stakeholders sabotaging the scheme
    the timing of undertaking conflict analysis and making sure it feeds into project design, implementation and monitoring is crucial to conflict-sensitising projects 
    adopting a conflict-sensitive approach meant an increase in costs, since the schemes had to be expanded and more funds requested from central government.  However, they are likely to work better due to the quality of the process, thus potentially saving other costs in future. 

The research asserts that experience from this project has shown that applying conflict sensitivity to the water projects generated benefits in terms of: 

    higher quality beneficiary participation
    beneficiaries themselves appreciating the opportunity to discuss what issues divide them and how planned interventions could mitigate or aggravate these
    increased understanding by outsiders (district authorities, private sector actors and CSOs) of beneficiary communities, and the actors and dynamics that influence them
    increased sense of responsibility on the side of the service providers about the impact they could potentially have through the decisions they make and the way they work.
