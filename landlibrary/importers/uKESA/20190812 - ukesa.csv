,A handbook on urban land markets for Africa,Piecing together an economic puzzle,"The handbook introduces key economic and related concepts explaining the functioning of urban land markets. By introducing key classical economic concepts, the handbook provides foundational economic terms that are often referred to in relation to urban land markets. In doing this, we do not imply that African land markets should or ought to 'fit' into neo-classical economic theories, nor do we propose that 'perfect' markets exist. Rather, we hope to provide the tools for engaging in a critical analysis of conventional economics, particularly in our understanding of African urban land markets. ",https://www.ukesa.info/download/IMWSD0NxLXQa7noF52ErewuPA13ciTlU/handbook_aulm_2010.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/a-handbook-on-urban-land-markets-for-africa2,2010-10-01,"Caroline Wanjiku Kihato

,BRICS CITIES,Facts and Analysis 2016,"This compendium and analysis of Cities in the BRICS countries were developed through a partnership between the South African Cities Network (SACN) and the South African Research Chair in Spatial Analysis and City Planning (SA&CP) at the University of the Witwatersrand. Since South Africa joined BRICS in 2010, multiple connections have been forged between South Africa and its alliance partners. However, although there is a growing volume of engagements, there is still inadequate knowledge and understanding across the BRICS. There is a common understanding, for example, that BRICS countries share a range of challenges and possibilities in relation to urbanisation and urban growth; but real knowledge of each other's urban contexts remains sparse.",http://www.sacities.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BRICS_cities_2016-final_owres.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/brics-cities,2016-09-01,"Bradley Peens

This shift should be from focusing exclusively on transferring communal land to traditional leaders, Common Property Institutions and private individuals, to recognising and accommodating existing forms of social tenure. This can be achieved by introducing a nationally constituted and locally administered land records system that sits alongside and complements the existing land registration system (that involves the Surveyor General’s office and the deeds registration system). The proposed alternatives are based on both practical experience and theoretical insights.",https://www.ukesa.info/download/JFyNGhvMrxib9ecWKf13smDQXtgwAIVT/Rethinking-communal-land-administration.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/unlocking-human-settlements-development-in-communal-land-areas,2016-12-01,,,,Urban Knowledge Exchange,en,Conference Papers & Reports,South Africa,land;land administration;rural areas;community land rights;land administration;common lands;customary land rights;legal pluralism,Indigenous & Community Land Rights,https://www.ukesa.info/images/7Uehar64dZKDmMO1pn2GJEs5YA0gXkRq_details/HDA_2016_Rethinking-communcal-land.PNG,Human settlements;Land

,SA Urban Conference 2018,Report,"The second national Urban Conference took place on 30 and 31 October 2018 in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was convened by the South African Cities Network (SACN) in partnership with the national departments of cooperative governance (COGTA), human settlements (DHS) and finance (National Treasury); the South Africa Local Government Association (SALGA), SA Council for Planners (SACPLAN), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, and the Gauteng Provincial Government. Under the theme of “Activating an All-of-Society Approach to Implementing the Urban Agenda” (#IUDF #allofsociety), the conference continued the discussions raised in 2017 at the first Urban Conference. In 2017, officials from South Africa’s major metros and various targeted stakeholders came together to build awareness and knowledge about the Integrated Urban Development Framework (IUDF), in order to inform their strategies and plans for urban development. The IUDF is South Africa’s national urban policy for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (particularly Goal 11: Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and the global New Urban Agenda (UN-Habitat). The 2018 Urban Conference’s aim was to engage and mobilise other urban actors who play a role in the development of towns and cities, as the IUDF recognises that successful implementation requires for an all-of-society approach. It starts from the premise that reaping the urban dividend requires the involvement of all urban role-players. In the spirit of the IUDF, the conference was organised and hosted in partnership with a range of key urban stakeholders. The partnership is a fitness and requires constant dedication to working together. Through the partnership process, the conference was able to bring together and include in the programme a range of diverse voices and a spectrum of issues. Without the dedicated teams of the partner organisations, this event would not have been possible.",http://www.sacities.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Urban Conference 2018 Report_FINAL[FV].pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/sa-urban-conference-2018,2019-06-10,,,,Urban Knowledge Exchange,en,Conference Papers & Reports,South Africa,land;urban planning;urban areas;development agencies;sustainable development;advocacy,Urban Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context,https://www.ukesa.info/images/BD27WbOCaEYdAHnZojxe63Lgf05FP4Nz_details/Screen-Shot-2019-06-11-at-12.30.31.png,Built environment;Construction;Human settlements;Land

,State of South African Cities Report,2006 Report,"The State of the Cities Report 2006 provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of South Africa’s largest cities, highlighting the important role played by cities in driving the national economy and improving the lives of South African residents. It raises current debates about cities, provoking urban stakeholders to think in new ways. This report follows on the first State of the Cities Report produced in 2004 (SOCR 2004). State of the Cities 2004 provided the first comprehensive picture of the major economic, social, environmental and governance realities affecting South Africa’s nine largest cities. The State of the Cities Report 2006 (SOCR 2006) builds on the important information and analysis contained in SOCR 2004. While the 2004 edition looked broadly at how cities were confronting the post-apartheid challenge in the ten years since democracy, the 2006 version examines a shorter time period between 2001 and 2006 and therefore has a sharper and more contemporary focus. SOCR 2006 looks at what has been achieved in cities during the first municipal term of office under the new municipal dispensation brought into being by the Local Government White Paper, the Municipal Structures Act and the Municipal Systems Acts. SOCR 2006 provides detailed information and analysis of trends that have affected urban development over the past five years. But it also looks forward at challenges and opportunities likely to be posted in the years ahead. ",http://www.sacities.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/state_of_cities_report2006.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/state-of-south-african-cities-report3,2006-06-05,"et. al.

The report takes a hard look at the forces that have transformed the country’s largest cities over the decade since 1994 and asks, if the current trends continue, whether cities can expect positive or negative things in the years to come. As part of the process of celebrating 10 years of democracy, the Office of the President has led a ‘Ten Year Review’ to assess what has been achieved over the last decade, and to define the strategic challenges for the future. Substantial preliminary research and thinking was released in October 2003 in the publication Towards a Ten Year Review.",http://www.sacities.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SOCR_2004.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/state-of-south-african-cities-report4,2004-06-07,"Kevin Allan

,State of the Cities Report 2011 - Towards resilient cities,A reflection on the first decade of a democratic and transformed local government in South Africa,"South African cities are under the national and international spotlight again. Community protests over service delivery, disputes about councillor selection, mismanagement and underspending of municipal budgets, and recurrent billing problems have attracted growing public concern. Yet cities have also been fêted for rekindling a spirit of national unity during 2010, delivering world-class transport schemes and leading the economy out of recession. This is part of a bigger conundrum: that cities can be crucibles of enormous creativity and economic dynamism, and also sites of deep social divide, poverty and disadvantage. Looking ahead, cities are critical to the achievement of national environmental objectives, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving resources, and city governments will need to raise their game if they are to tackle the complex challenges of economic transformation, social division and climate change. The purpose of the State of the Cities Report 2011 is threefold. Firstly, the report assesses the progress made by South African cities over the last decade in relation to key development outcomes. The central question is whether developmental metropolitan government has had the desired effect in improving socio-economic and environmental conditions, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the country. Secondly, the report reviews strategic problems and opportunities facing the cities. It is important to put key urban issues on the agendas of national and provincial government, the business sector, and civil society that may not previously have attracted the attention they deserve. Thirdly, the report communicates essential messages about the planning, development and management of cities to a new generation of civic leaders and officials taking office after the 2011 municipal elections. ",http://www.sacities.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SACN 2011 Report.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/state-of-south-african-cities-report2,2011-08-01,"Blake Robinson

The learning material presents an outline of the many challenges of financial sustainability and effective service delivery facing Southern African cities.

,The State of the Expanded Public Works Programme in South African Cities,Annual Report for 2017-2018,"The South African Cities Network (SACN) EPWP Reference Group is a peer-based platform, comprising key city officials responsible for implementing the EPWP in their respective cities. This collective has continued to meet quarterly over the 2017/18 period, providing a forum in which experiences and knowledge are exchanged. The Reference Group continues to contribute to enhancing coordination between the cities and other role players towards the effective and synergistic implementation of the EPWP. This forum allows for continuous and consistent generation of knowledge and sharing of information, experiences and lessons learnt. As the SACN continues to facilitate the generation of knowledge and the sharing of information through the EPWP Reference Group, the key objective is to ensure that all stakeholders will continue to value these annual reports and the lessons highlighted therein. The aim is for the knowledge generated to contribute significantly to enhancing job creation in South Africa, through information, reflection and important learnings based upon the implementation of the EPWP – widely recognised as a flagship public employment programme. The experiences shared through this peer-based platform of cities are encapsulated in the annual report. The aim of this report is therefore to highlight the progress and implementation of the EPWP by the cities in the 2017/18 year of Phase III of the EPWP. The main body of the report provides an overview of EPWP Phase III targets, the institutional arrangements that are in place, and the continuing challenges faced during implementation. This is followed by individual city reports (Annexure I), in which the focus is on progress made as well as the key obstacles and successes in implementing the EPWP. The final part of the report, Annexure-II, describes some best practice case studies in selected member cities that have been documented by the EPWP Reference Group (RG), in an effort to support shared learning from experience.",http://www.sacities.net/the-state-of-the-expanded-public-works-programme-annual-report-2017-2018,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/the-state-of-the-expanded-public-works-programme-in-south-african-cities,2019-06-06,"Dr. Geci Karuri-Sebina

,The Urban Land Paper Series - Volume 2,A Transit-Oriented Development Lens,"The papers in this volume take a city perspective and provide both a critical reflection of and a pragmatic response to what cities are able to do given their current mandate and powers. The first paper begins by considering what the TOD agenda means for the urban poor. It questions whether TOD can adequately address the existing land challenges in South African cities, given the politics of land inequality and the skewed property markets. The next paper explores land ownership patterns along one of the TOD corridors in Johannesburg to understand how land ownership could potentially shape development and spatial transformation. What emerges is an interesting perspective that highlights how, compared to the private sector, the public sector has probably not been an effective player in the land game of extracting value. ",http://www.sacities.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The Urban Land Paper Series Vol 2.pdf,https://www.ukesa.info/library/view/the-urban-land-paper-series-volume-2,2018-08-01,"Geoffrey Bickford
