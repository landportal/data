"bridge:A28757";"Gender, households, and markets: inherited land and labour force participation of rural household in the Cordillera Region, Philippines";"";"Why does viewing a household as a single unit have serious downfalls for gender analysis' The unitary view overlooks the crucial fact that gender relations between family members play a large role in intra-household decisions about decision-making, time allocation, and expenditure. A collective model on the other hand allows household analysis to consider gender relations, with attention to women's and men's respective access to, control over, or ownership of resources. This research tests the unitary model in a farm household context, in relation to the amount of inherited land of husbands and wives. It finds that income pooling (joining of income into one pot) between male and female members of the same household is not the norm. Rather environmental factors, such as legal and customary systems of entitlements, and markets determine the distribution of resources between household members. Links were also observable between social institutions, women's land rights, married women's labour force participation and household relations. ";"L.D.

This collection of reports, testimonies and analyses portrays the diverse experiences of women all over Africa who have lived through civil wars, apartheid, genocide and gendered political violence such as rape. Contributions include discussions of violence against women in Rwanda, Chad and Liberia; the involvement of and impact on women of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission; and the increase in violence against women caused by the proliferation of SALW. A link is drawn between the colonial past of most African nations and the ongoing civil wars. These weak states are unable to enforce international human rights conventions that would otherwise protect women. The collection catalogues the abuses sustained by women and also outlines some of the ways in which women have mobilised, including their lobbying activities for greater involvement in the process of peace-building.

"bridge:A52381";"Towards Gender Equality in Tanzania: A Profile on Gender Relations";"";"How are men's social identities constructed in Tanzania? How can available qualitative and quantitative data be used in such a way as to reveal the nuances of interaction between women and men there? These and other questions are addressed in this gender country profile, which resulted from a participatory methods workshop on gender and development issues in Tanzania. While focusing on gender relations, the profile also highlights women's situation per se. It emphasises vital areas identified by Tanzanian activists and areas where initiatives to transform gender relations are currently being implemented. After outlining the context within which gender relations operate in Tanzania, the profile goes on to consider gender relations and the law, focusing on customary law, in view of its importance. Subsequent sections of the profile deal with work and livelihoods, with attention to sustainable rural livelihoods, land and out-migration among other issues. The next sections address the gender dimensions of poverty in Tanzania; education, health and well-being; public life, political participation, and the media and information, with a particular focus on Tanzanian women's political empowerment and on gender budget initiatives there. The final section looks at the potential for transforming unequal gender relations and for empowering women in Tanzania, as well as at the present challenges and constraints. Case studies on Tabata women organising; widows' choices; changing male attitudes; sex work and HIV/ AIDs; the low status of women workers; internalisation of customary attitudes; gender relations in the academy; a man's view of his sexuality; and on gender power imbalance are provided.

It starts by describing the main economic trends produced by globalisation: trade liberalisation; increased globalised production due to direct investment of multinational corporations; and financial liberalisation. The gender impact of those trends are then analysed in detail beginning with employment and displacement effects, including their influence on women's position within the household and the labour markets around the world. The gender dimension of the flexibilisation of labour due to a reorganisation of production, including part-time, home-based work and informal sector is also examined. The survey also explores the gender implications of privatisation on rural women's work, with a specific focus on land rights especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, as well as on the gender imbalances provoked by an increased demand for social protection and the inability of the state to provide it. The document ends with some recommendations on how to formulate gender-aware policies at international and national levels.

This comprises one part of a study on women and land in five countries in Eastern Africa - and was commissioned by the Eastern African Sub-Regional Support Initiative for the Advancement of Women (EASSI). This study of Tigray and Oromiya Regional States, Ethiopia, suggests that women's education is critical to improve their status and ownership of productive resources, and that communities must ensure that girls are entitled to an equal share in the family property. The report argues that any effort and initiative must be supported by laws that enable girls and women to inherit and own property. The report also shows that in environments where cultural norms do not value women, there is a need for support systems to enable women to own, and use the land they own, without constraints. ";"H.

"bridge:A37298";"Women and the right to food international law and state practice";"";"Because of their lower social and economic status, as well as physiological needs, women are often more vulnerable to nutritional problems. When it comes to sharing food resources in the home, women and girls can lose out. Indeed, the full realisation of the right to food for women depends on parallel achievements in the right to health, education, access to information and access to resources such as land. This paper analyses, from a gender perspective, the relevant international instruments on the right to food, and the rights of women, before examining implementation and monitoring at the state level. Evidence suggests that there remains a lack of clarity on women's right to food. Even in cases where the law is comprehensive on this right, women continue to suffer from discrimination. Given that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is the main instrument protecting women's rights, the absence in its text of a specific article on the right to food is an important omission which needs to be addressed. When it is mentioned, it is only in relation to pregnant women. This is reflected when countries invariably focus on mothers or even just children when reporting on food-related issues. In many countries the legal frameworks have been strengthened on gender equality and on the protection of the human right to food. Now what is needed are institutional mechanisms that can act as a catalyst to ensure such rights are realised for women. Those that already exist, such as national women's machineries, require strengthening. As do women's groups and organisations who play an essential role in awareness-raising and lobbying to ensure women's rights, including to food, are realised. ";"I.

"bridge:A21822";"Citizenship: towards a feminist synthesis";"";"This article outlines how citizenship can be used as a political and theoretical tool by combining 'rights' and 'participation'. Participation in social, economic, cultural and political decision-making provides a more dynamic and active form of rights in which people work together to improve their quality of life. This must reflect the fact that certain types of participation such as 'informal' and/or local political participation are often those in which women take the lead, providing them with a sense of personal power. This may be achieved through an internationalist agenda which understands citizenship as broad rights and responsibilities operating in a context of democracy and accountability. Exclusion can also be countered through a 'differentiated universalism' which recognises the difference within groups, but retains a universal commitment to participation for all. Politics here can work through dialogue and accept different and changing positions - examples of the South Africa Women's National Commission, which represented a great variety of women's positions in the transition from apartheid, and women's centres in Belfast operating in the context of the Catholic/Protestant struggles, are cited.

The government has faced difficulties changing attitudes that discriminate against women. However, mandatory changes in Peru's education system, including the introduction of the National Sex Education Programme, are highlighted as positive steps. Other actions by the government include the establishment of numerous laws and legal instruments to protect women as well as promote and enhance their participation in public spaces and their access to socio-economic resources, particularly for rural women. A Ministry for the Advancement of Women and Human Development (PROMUDEH) was also created in October 1996, charged with ensuring that Peru is meeting its CEDAW commitments, as well as following-up with the implementation of domestic law. The report goes on to outline in considerable detail the laws that promote gender and protect women's rights, and how these have been applied in all areas of Peruvian life, including in health, employment, education and marriage.

"bridge:A71895";"Introduction: making change happen – citizen action and national policy reform";"";"
How has citizen action resulted in national policy change in different parts of the world?

This is the full introduction to the edited volume of the book Making Change Happen, published by Zed Books. It includes case studies, such as: Turkey, where a campaign for women’s rights led to a new penal code with thirty-five amendments for the protection of sexual rights; South Africa, where the Treatment Action Campaign led to public recognition of HIV/AIDS as an issue, and to over 60,000 people gaining access to treatment; the Philippines, where the National Campaign for Land Reform gained the redistribution of half of the country’s farmland to 3 million poor households; and Mexico, which enacted important reforms to national budget priorities and health delivery mechanisms following a campaign to reduce maternal mortality. The remaining case studies this publication examines are from India, Brazil, Morocco, and Chile.

The introduction begins by discussing the projects and case studies' backgrounds, before covering a number of different aspects of citizen action. A section on participation and national policy change looks at change from the perspectives of working with and challenging the state, and the importance of linking both sides of this equation. Spaces for collective action towards policy change, mobilising structures (actors, networks and coalitions) and strategies, and managing contentiousness are also discussed.

Next, the problem of ‘success’ is explained, with the author highlighting that many activists are increasingly realising that policy change on its own is not enough to achieve lasting and sustainable progress, and can often result in unfortunate trade-offs. There are a number of implications for current debates and practices drawn from the case studies, presented throughout the text in a number of propositions put forward by the author:


    
    Political opportunities are opened and closed through historic, dynamic and iterative processes. While political opportunities create possibilities for collective action for policy change, these openings themselves may have been created by prior mobilisation.
    



    
    Competition for formal political power is needed, in conjunction with civil society engagement in policy processes, to create new impetuses for reform, and bring key allies into positions of influence.
    



    
    Successful reform campaigns depend on careful navigation to link international pressures with differing and constantly changing local and national contexts.
    



    
    Successful policy change requires complex and highly developed mobilising structures which link national reformers to local and faith-based groups, the media, and repositories of expertise. Such structures are built over time, deeply grounded in the societies where they are found, and linked to the biographies of those who lead them.
    



    
    Alliances between social actors and champions of change inside the state are critical to make policy change happen. Social mobilisation structures can provide opportunities for state-based reformers to generate change from within.
    



    
    Policy change on contentious issues requires contentious forms of mobilisation, with the ability to frame issues carefully, adjust to changing circumstances, and draw upon a wide range of strategies.
    



    
    Robust and sustainable changes generally require campaigns that link the national to the local, and pay attention to the processes of empowering citizens and deepening democratic governance, as well as to effecting policy change itself.

"bridge:A53901";"Access to Land in Post-Apartheid South Africa: Implications for the South African Black Woman";"";"Indigenous land tenure arrangements in South Africa have generally consisted of communal ownership. In this system, who benefited from the land depended on their status as family or clan head. The colonial regime dispossessed Africans of land in favour of European arrivals, or defined family property as ancestral property in which the senior males of the head family were taken as the owners with the rights to inherit. The post-apartheid government conceptualised acess to land for the previously disadvantaged as a human right. However, in practice, it remained tolerant of (distorted) customary law which privileged male access to land. In 2005 the case in the Constitutional Court Bhe v Magistrate revolutionised the law by rejecting customs which discriminated against black women's inheritance rights. This decision is likely to have a positive impact on black women's capacity to own land. ";"M. A.

"bridge:A52123";"Indigenous People";"";"In the DFID White Paper, the government's commitment to addressing gender inequality highlights the frequent 'double disadvantage' of poor women. Poor women from minority groups, however, may experience additional discrimination. There is abundant evidence to show that many ethnic minorities and indigenous people are subject to economic, social and political disadvantage. The complex relationships between gender and ethnicity need to be addressed in order to understand the social processes leading to poverty of particular groups. To date, however, the international development community has paid relatively little attention to the specific disadvantage of women from ethnic minorities. This paper outlines the international policy framework as it stands, which shapes donor interventions in this area, highlighting the limitations in relation to gender. It goes on to detail DFID's position on ethnic minorities and indigenous people and the treatment of gender within it. Gender and ethnicity within the project cycle is subsequently addressed through a review of existing projects designed around the rights and needs of women from minorities. Issues raised overall include the rights of ethnic minorities versus the state's nation-building agenda, indigenous rights to land and natural resources, gender specific knowledge, and gender-related deficiencies in participatory methods.

Esta vinculación se procesa desde varios ámbitos: como procesadora y conservadora de alimentos y, por tanto, como responsables de la alimentación de su familia. No obstante esto, su trabajo es “invisibilizado”. Tiene limitado acceso y control sobre recursos y servicios, acceso a la tierra, al crédito, a los servicios de extensión y capacitación, todo lo cual configura un esquema de complejas brechas que le afectan. La formulación y fortalecimiento de políticas públicas y la instalación de estructuras formales en las instituciones que trabajan lo rural, se plantea como solución para resolver las brechas mencionadas, de modo que hombres y mujeres tengan un tratamiento equitativo, en la implementación de proyectos y programas sociales sustentables. Tradición y cultura ocupan un lugar importante cuando se trata de analizar las barreras que afectan a la mujer rural frente a la equidad. Se debe considerar la instalación de una política pública con perspectiva de género en el sector rural, todo lo cual implica acciones nacionales y sectoriales.

This article investigates gender discrimination in the region, among the Igbo ethnic group, with regard to land property rights; and makes policy recommendations to overcome the failures of past intervention efforts, many of which considered this problem as too culturally sensitive.

Laws protecting women’s rights are often ignored at the village level. For example, Section 43 of the Nigerian Constitution guarantees every Nigerian (man or woman) the right to acquire and own immovable property, and the Nigerian Land Use Act of 1978 also confers general powers upon men and women to own real property. However, customary law in Nigeria’s rural communities restricts women’s inheritance rights, thereby perpetuating female poverty and subordination. Furthermore, violating the land rights of women generates competition and social conflicts between men and women, which have implications for peace, social cohesion and development.

The following are among the conclusions of this study:


	Access to natural resources in rural communities of South-Eastern Nigeria has remained a major form of economic domination by men, which has left women, particularly widows, highly vulnerable.
	Moving away from long-held beliefs and customs toward respecting gender equity requires dialogue involving all stakeholders.
	Change must also affect structures that generate conflict through deprivation, exclusion and other forms of injustice.
	Peaceful conflict transformation that involves the development of perspectives through dialogue with all parties (at many levels) changes the way men and women think about womanhood or widowhood, and helps them move toward positive peace.
	An inclusive and better gender-sensitive approach in policy making would improve the effectiveness of, and compliance with, legal and socio-economic reforms.
	The equal rights of men and women to land are essential for ensuring sustainable rural development, social equity, economic growth and any effort to address gender inequalities.
	Policy reform to ensure the effective, equitable and sustainable use of land in Nigeria will bring about poverty reduction and development.

"bridge:A68999";"Gendered dimensions of land and rural livelihoods: the case of new settler farmer displacement at Nuanetsi Ranch, Mwenezi District, Zimbabwe";"";"The biofuel boom has become a core issue in Zimbabwean land and development debates. Biofuels require large tracts of land for production; and the land acquisition programmes by the various state, non-state actors and individuals have been termed ‘land grabbing’. The increasing global demand for biofuels has different gender specific socio-economic and environmental effects in Zimbabwe. Males and females in the biofuel producing zone may face a differential risk matrix, comprising different issues.

Nuanetsi Ranch had been invaded by villagers from different parts of Mwenezi, Chiredzi and Chivi communal areas since 2000. In February 2010, the government announced that the settlers had to be removed and resettled in other ’uncontested lands’ in the area, compromising their rights to sustainable livelihoods, human development and land acquisition. The perceptions of the men and women residing at Chigwizi has had a bearing on understanding the nature of gendered land and rural livelihoods in the context of biofuel production in Zimbabwe, after fast track land reform.

This study seeks to answer the following key questions:


	How does displacement due to the large-scale biofuel production at Nuanetsi Ranch affect the land rights and livelihoods of the men and women settlers who have been resident on the land since 2000?
	What are the perceptions of the men and women with regards to their displacement from Chigwizi village?
	What role have the district land committee, the provincial land committees, and other institutions involved in land management played in the displacement of the men and women settlers at Nuanetsi ranch?
	Has biofuel production at Nuanetsi led to a shift in policy by the government from smallholder farming back to the pre-fast track land reform phase?
	What has been the role of the ‘new elites’ in biofuel production?

In Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, despite changes in national law and policy aiming to improve women's land tenure, none of the land reforms meet human rights standards. This is because legal regulation of land blurs with customary laws mostly relating to land transactions and family, marriage or inheritance. The mix of both systems often has a detrimental impact on women's ability to claim their land rights. HRBA is useful because it helps to standardise laws and put into place mechanisms that protect women from direct and indirect discrimination. Recommendations of the report include: the need for a gender impact assessment on any land reform process, measures to educate and inform women of their rights, and legal institutions to support women when their land rights have been violated.

"bridge:A72090";"Website: Right to Food Campaign";"";"The new India’s Right to Food Campaign website was launched in March 2014 at the campaign’s fifth convention. It is an action-oriented website, with lots of action-oriented material on the right to food in India including primers, articles, survey reports, court orders, campaign tools and much more As explained in its foundation statement, the right to food campaign is an informal network of individuals and organisations committed to the realisation of the right to food in India. The campaign began in 2001, as an offshoot of public interest litigation in the Supreme Court, and quickly grew into a country-wide movement. The campaign’s shared values and organisational principles are expressed in the collective statement.

These values include:

Addressing the structural roots of hunger such as the deepening agrarian crisis, the continuing neglect of infants and children in public policy, persistent gender discrimination (together with absence of maternity entitlements), the dismantling of the public distribution system, and the disempowerment of Dalits, Adivasis and other disadvantaged groups (including the urban poor).

No coercive displacement to disrupt people's control over natural resources and food in security.

Resisting discrimination and communalism by committing to challenge and resist the growth of anti-democratic tendencies in the country. Our commitment to the right to food is inseparable from our commitment to social justice and democratic values, and implies firm opposition to communalism in any form. Democracy is premised on the fundamental equality of all citizens. Therefore it is incompatible with discrimination based on caste, gender, religion or other attributes. We are committed to putting these concerns at the centre of our work on the right to food.

Universalisation with equity by advocating universal provision of quality basic services and facilities related to nutrition, health and education (particularly the Public Distribution System, the Integrated Child Development Services and the Mid Day Meal Scheme), with priority to disadvantaged groups and special recognition of the rights of young children to nutrition and care.

The Right to Food Campaign is committed to the principles of transparency and accountability in all its activities. This includes open access to campaign documents and full transparency in financial matters.

"bridge:A71476";"Gender & Land – Implications for Sustainable Development A working paper for development practitioners";"";"Less than 2% of the land available worldwide is owned by women. Why is the issue of land so gendered? What approaches and lessons learned can development professionals utilise to address the issue of gender and land? Data demonstrates a glaring gender gap in land holdings in all regions of the world. This is regardless of the fact that women produce 60% to 80% of food in developing countries. This working paper highlights critical issues concerning gender and land and provides an overview of the international and regional legal and policy context. It also contains an inside view of Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) good practices relating to challenging gender equality and land. There is still a large gap between international and regional instruments and policies that guarantee equal rights to land and their successful implementation. Women and men need to know their rights, access to justice, good governance and equal participation in decision-making for women and men need to be enhanced and structural obstacles and root causes of gender inequality need to be tackled. Key recommendations from this paper include working with women at the operational level to empower them in their rights and enable their participation in decision-making processes. Approaches involving the whole community are a crucial element for success by means of increasing awareness of gender equality and transforming thinking around traditional gender roles - community leaders, including religious leaders need to be consulted and guided. National law is often more powerful than international law and a solid analysis of land tenure on the national level, including its gendered nature, is a must for any agriculture and/ or rural development project.

Yet in many parts of India there remains a huge gender gap in land ownership and control - with significant implications for women's economic and social status. This document traces the journey of the Working Group on Women and Land Ownership (WGWLO), a network of 23 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) based in Gujarat, India, which came together in 2003 to bring visibility to the issue of women and agricultural land ownership, and to carry out advocacy initiatives to change aspects in laws and policies of the Government of Gujarat which inhibit women from owning land in their name. This document describes the process which led to WGWLO's emergence and details the strategies they used, including organising workshops at the grassroots level to raise awareness of the issues, conducting research, reaching out to the media, carrying out capacity building and advocacy at the national level - for example advocating for incentives to be incorporated into government schemes so that men are motivated to transfer land in the name of women from their household - and trying to integrate the issue of women's land ownership within ongoing NGO programmes.

Access to, and ownership of land for women is often problematic – particularly when laws and culture collide. Land issues, including family property matters, are often determined within entrenched cultural norms, resulting in the application of a hybrid legal interpretation of both customary and national law that leaves many women at a disadvantage. Under the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Gender Equality 2005-2015, the Commonwealth Secretariat has spearheaded efforts to secure women’s rights to land in Africa.

This handbook on women’s land rights in Nigeria draws on both the technical expertise of the Secretariat officials, as well as the local experience of Nigerian government officials, women’s activists, traditional leaders, judges and rural women. It focuses on reconciling customary Nigerian norms with more formal judicial processes, national laws and international and regional human rights standards. The aim of this handbook is to address both policy imperatives and realities on the ground, so as to inform and assist Nigerian women regarding legal procedures relating to land and property rights.  ";"";"";"Commonwealth Secretariat";"BRIDGE";"2013-01-01";"en";"land;land rights;women";"Land & Gender";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"011;NGA";"";"https://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/ids-document/A68830";"http://secretariat.thecommonwealth.org/files/253838/FileName/Women'sLandRightsHandbook-Nigeria.pdf";"";"";"";"";"Gender relations and power;Land rights;Human rights and social movements"

These efforts resulted in the passage in January 2000, of ?The Law on Reorganization of Certain Terms and Procedures of Litigation in Personal Status Matters? (Law No.1, 2000). This legislation was controversial because it improved the rights of women to initiate divorce and established a family fund to provide child support to impoverished families. One of the key challenges for the PSL coalition was to present their position in ways that coincided with Islamic Sharia laws, as opposed to appealing to secular or feminist traditions. This development is important both because of the victory achieved at the policy-making level, and also because it represents a type of coalition politics that allows for the mobilisation of Islamic values as a positive force for feminist social and political change.

With regard to agriculture, the IGTN asserts that control over agriculture by states rather than the WTO would ensure that small-scale and subsistence farmers have control over farming and food supply; a particularly important concern for women around the world who are those responsible for ensuring household food security and managing family farms. The IGTN calls for agriculture to be taken out of the WTO. Secondly, as social services continue to be privatised in many southern countries, the burden of care work is disproportionately borne by women. They are also forced to pay higher prices to private providers of essential services and also face threats to their employment in the public sector when areas such as health are privatised. IGTN therefore suggests that services that are essential to social reproduction be removed from GATS. The Network calls for the removal of TRIPS from the WTO and for countries' to have the right to protect their biological and agricultural resources and diversity-often the role played by indigenous women who protect this knowledge. Finally, the advocacy document calls for no negotiations on the Singapore issues-which includes investment-and for a critical redefinition of FDI which has encouraged gender biases and exploitation of female labor, especially in EPZs. The document underscores the fundamental position of the IGTN that the scope of the WTO should be reduced to trade specific issues.

This paper looks at the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU) in the fight for women's right to vote in Egypt in the early twentieth century. The EFU had much in common with the international women's movement then mobilising around women's right to vote. The IWSA represented the basis for an 'international sisterhood', where the EFU's goals were in line with other feminist organisations that came together under the IWSA. Indeed, there were many similarities in the demands of Western and Eastern women, as expressed through their national associations. Nevertheless, the EFU's involvement in the International Women's Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) was criticised from within Egypt as representing a 'westernisation' of Egyptian women. The accusation of 'westernisation' misrepresents the convergence of interests between Eastern and Western women. Women's rights concerns, particularly around suffrage, were in fact being shaped by similar political, economic and social changes the world over. ";"M. A.

Poverty measures of males and females were found to be significantly different, in both urban and rural areas, where higher levels are observed among females than males. Poverty is more prevalent in Upper Egypt, where poverty measures are twice as large as the national level. The poor, both men and women, are often uneducated, unemployed, working in the private sector, and account for the highest percentage of child labour. The report finds that female-headed households account for between 16 and 22 per cent of total households, with many of these women dependent on income transfers, either from relatives and neighbours, or from mosques to assist with basic needs for themselves and their families. Other findings include the following: the probability of being poor increases for those working in agriculture or services; and poverty rises where illiteracy rates are higher. ";"H.

This paper asks if women's lack of rights increases household poverty and their own vulnerability to infection, and if securing these rights can reduce the impacts of the epidemic on poverty. The paper notes that gender inequality in land ownership is common in SSA, due to male preference in inheritance, male bias in state programmes of land distribution, and gender inequality in the land market. It argues that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is increasing these inequalities: for example many HIV/AIDS widows have lost their property in disputes with members of their deceased spouse's extended family. Evidence shows that, in cases where women's property and inheritance rights are upheld, women acting as heads and/or primary caregivers of HIV/AIDS- affected households are better able to avoid the negative economic and social consequences of HIV/AIDS, largely because property provides some security and empowerment. The paper calls for the implementation of laws that protect women's land and property rights, whether statutory or customary; improved access to legal mechanisms when women's rights to property are undermined; and public education campaigns that challenge male-biased social norms around property and inheritance.

It addresses women's property rights in marriage and women's right to negotiate sex, it sets the minimum age of marriage at eighteen, prohibits female genital mutilation (FGM) and criminalises widow inheritance. Bride price is still not prohibited, but the payment of bride price will no longer be essential for formalising customary marriages. The bill criminalises marital rape and provides for civil remedies, such as compensation and restricting orders. The Domestic Relations Bill does still not consider cohabitation as de facto marriage, but provides parties in such relationships with certain rights, including the right to register the fact they live together and any monetary or non-monetary contributions made. A competent court may then distribute the property equitably in accordance with those contributions. Polygamy is also strictly regulated by guidelines that provide for the economic support of all wives. The bill also provides for equal sexual rights and establishes more equitable grounds for divorce. This paper also discusses domestic and international law and Islamic Family Law and argues that though the reforms are a step forward, they do not go far enough.

Over the past twenty years, with the break up of the communes, new land tenure arrangements have given greater control over land to individual households. This essay argues that recent transfers in land tenure between households have caused women to lose rights and decision making power over land, as well as possibilities to benefit from land. Men's migration to cities has caused a 'feminisation' of agriculture which fuels a market for tenure transfer. In Zhejiang province, the rights of 156,280 rural women were infringed, among which more than 97,000 lost rights to land tenure, and more than 71,000 retained land tenure but their rights to share the benefits of the land were infringed upon.

"bridge:A52756";"Promoting Gender Equity in the Democratic Process: women's Paths to Political Participation and Decisionmaking";"";"How can women be integrated in processes of democratisation? The participation of women in political and economic processes is essential for democratic governance. The PROWID grants system supported activities such as lobbying and advocacy, skills development and developing institutions to further women's social and economic rights. This report looks at women's participation in political culture, civil society and government institutions. Importantly, it puts participation in the context of shifting gender (and other) roles and identities. It acknowledges that such shifts can allow for women in particular to develop new skills and access new rights. Concepts and definitions of gendered participation are illustrated through examples from PROWID's projects. The report recommends the development of tools and strategies to support policy analysis and build skills through, for example, legal and human rights training, political education for women and support for lobbying. It also illustrates how collective empowerment can be supported through facilitation of networks and bringing different organisations together to exchange ideas. It points out that essential credibility in political arenas can be generated by creating a body of knowledge about women's political participation that might include, among other things, comprehensive gender-disaggregated statistics.

"bridge:A52757";"Governing for Equity, Gender, Citizenship and Governance";"";"This publication comes out of the Gender, Citizenship and Governance programme of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT), Netherlands. The project aimed to develop good practice in changing governance institutions to promote gender equality, enhance citizen participation and build accountability of public administration systems. Action research projects were conducted with 16 women's organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in eight countries in Southern Africa and South Asia (South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh). The research projects showed how women's citizenship responsibilities are often unpaid and therefore hidden from economic management systems. This precludes government accountability for the needs of women. Potential avenues such as laws or institutionalisation of citizen participation do not necessarily translate into protection or inclusion of women. The action research projects therefore cover four areas: promoting women in political office; engendering institutions; claiming citizenship; and governing peace. Projects involved training and capacity-building for development practitioners, drawing together good practice and networking/sharing information.The publication begins with a section on global debates, providing a background to the ways in which citizenship can be used in promoting gender equality. It then goes on to the four case study sections as outlined above. The section on claiming citizenship for example includes studies from South Africa on reform of Customary Law, from West Bengal on the rights of sex workers in Bangladesh (see case study in section 5 of the Overview Report in this pack), lobbying and advocacy activities in Zimbabwe, and rights over guardianship of children in Bangladesh (see article from the In Brief bulletin in this pack).The report then presents several conclusions and recommendations which include:•Interventions must start from women's needs.•'Voice' is not enough. Institutional rules and norms and public perceptions must also be influenced thorough contacts with key officials and engaging civil society.•Spaces must be made to talk in terms of citizenship entitlements. Examples of such spaces could be processes of law and constitutional reform or setting up regulation boards that involve both men and women in assessing the impact of development interventions.•Decisions must be pragmatic and must make sense in practice and take into account the variations in feminist/women's demands.•In the struggle for rights, it is important to work in conjunction with states and institutions when campaigning for change.

It is an opportunity for women's groups to monitor their government and to raise concerns about the official submission of the government to the CEDAW committee. This shadow report maintains an explicit focus on those areas these groups deem to be of particular concern in Peru, namely, sexual and reproductive rights, discriminatory political practices and violence against women. Despite the existence of legislation, significant aspects of women's rights are overlooked. These include narrow definitions of sexual abuse; little recognition by public officials at all levels of the existence or seriousness of these problems; difficulties accessing (emergency) contraception and information despite laws guaranteeing their availability; the persistence of laws that state that life begins at conception, thereby preventing women from accessing abortions, even in cases of (marital) rape; and continued discrimination against sex-workers and weak child trafficking laws. The report concludes that in these areas, the government still has some distance to go before the CEDAW conventions are met.

"bridge:A59291";"Gender and Climate Change: Supporting Resources Collection";"";"This Supporting Resources Collection - part of the BRIDGE Cutting Edge Pack on Gender and Climate Change- showcases existing work on gender and climate change. It presents summaries of a mix of conceptual and research papers, policy briefings, advocacy documents, case study material and practical tools from diverse regions. Examining why a focus on gender and climate change is important, the resources look at the human and gender impacts of climate change, the global and national responses to climate change and locally relevant gender aware responses to climate change. They seek to address a wide range of questions including:

    How do gender inequalities affect the ways that women and men are affected by climate change and constrain the choices women? 


    How can we ensure human rights are at the centre of climate change responses? 


    How can we ensure women play an equal role in decision-making around climate change?

The collection also provides information on international frameworks and conventions relating to climate change, and as well as mitigation mechanisms and key climate funds.  Finally, this collection contains a 'networking and contacts’ section, which gives details of the organisations featured in the Cutting Edge Pack. Details of how to obtain copies or download the full texts of all featured resources are provided with each summary.

"bridge:A22164";"Housing development and women’s right to land and property";"";"The Women Advancement Trust (WAT) in Tanzania carries out various initiatives related to land rights, affordable housing, and inheritance rights. This report presents lessons learned from a housing and shelter development initiative. The goals of the initiative were to empower low-income communities, particularly women, to participate fully and actively in all aspects of human settlements development, including the improvement of their living and housing conditions. The initiative sought to achieve this through providing education and offering training and technical assistance in urban and peri-urban areas of Tanzania on land rights, housing construction, and savings and credit. The authors consider various aspects of the programme including housing development and the establishment of housing cooperatives and groups, infrastructural development, and information, communication, advocacy and lobbying by WAT around women's right to own land. The authors conclude that WAT's combination of promoting gender sensitivity in land and property ownership and housing development provides a unique opportunity for the poorest residents to benefit from new government initiatives to support housing development and improve the living conditions for the urban poor. WAT also has an important role to play in raising awareness of these initiatives. ";"T. Anyamba

In recent years, nearly all of the country's commercial farm land has been re-designated, leaving most farm workers dislocated from their farm villages. The government of Zimbabwe argues that the land reform programme is needed to achieve historical and social justice. However, this article concludes that the government is engaged in serious human rights violations and is appropriating land to distribute to its followers for political not social justice ends. The rights of vulnerable groups such as farm workers, women and children are not being protected. For example, earlier reforms put in place to enhance women's tenure rights are not being implemented. Also, the possibilities for single, widowed and divorced women to use resettlement land productively are extremely limited as they often possess only meagre resources. Using a human rights perspective, this article calls for a concerted strategy to protect people's livelihoods through a wider protection of their property rights. ";"B. Derman

However, much of this reform has focussed on men as head of households, meaning men have benefited more from economic reform, both economically and in terms of their power within the household. Inequalities continue in access to and control of key resources such as land, water, credit and rest time, as well as in access to public services. To respond to these inequalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has identified five key objectives: (1) to increase social awareness of gender among officials and the rural population in general; (2) to increase rural women's access to and control of key resources; (3) to integrate gender targets and sex-disaggregated M&E tools in policies, plans and projects in the Ministry and agricultural sector more broadly; (4) to integrate gender into agricultural research, public services and training; (5) to empower women and increase their participation in decision-making roles in the ministry and sector in general. A plan is outlined to work towards these objectives.

"bridge:A59290";"Gender and Development In Brief ‘Gender and Climate Change’ – edition 22";"";"Climate change is increasingly being recognised as a global crisis, but responses to it have so far been overly focused on scientific and economic solutions. How then do we move towards morepeople-centred, gender-aware climate change policies and processes? How do we respond to the different needs and concerns of women and men, and also challenge the gender inequalities that mean women are more likely to lose out than men in the face of climate change? This In Brief sets out why it is vital to address the gender dimensions of climate change. It maps pathways for making climate change responses more gender aware and – potentially – transformative and suggests promoting a rights based approach to climate change. This is to ensure that climate change policies and processes draw on human rights frameworks as well as finding alternatives to market-based approaches. When market-based approaches are used to address climate change mitigation they should benefit women equally and not exclude or further disadvantage them.  Another recommendation suggests learning from people focused gender – transformative approaches at the local level and apply these lessons to national and international policy.  In this respect, the In Brief includes inspiring examples of local, gender-aware innovations in Colombia and India. The case studies have been produced collaboratively through participatory workshops, semi-structured interviews and site visits with FUNDAEXPRESIÓN in Colombia and the Community Awareness Centre (CAC) in India. FUNDAEXPRESIÓN plays a key role in promoting strong local networks to create resilience to climate change and CAC engages women and men in developing relevant solutions that empower women.

This report outlines the status of women in Ethiopia and initiatives on the part of all government and non-governmental actors to address the goals set out by CEDAW. Institutional commitments to address gender issues are in place. However, the socioeconomic status of women, particularly in rural areas, remains lower in Ethiopia's male-biased social structures. The national women's machinery in partnership with civil society and donors has been trying to tackle this situation through the development of a National Plan of Action with clearly defined objectives. Women's concerns are being addressed through changes in a broad range of areas, including water, domestic violence agricultural and family policy. Initiatives have been introduced to improve access to credit, training, skills and information, and improved support for advocacy campaigns around women's concerns. Progress in key areas are outlined, with statistics on legal equality, life expectancy, female mortality and education included. The report concludes by outlining the challenges still faced by Ethiopia, including a lack of resources to initiate long-term programmes, the need for more gender-disaggregated data, a lack of awareness of gender mainstreaming and the need to understand women's issues as well as involve them in political processes.

"bridge:A21817";"Women, citizenship and difference";"";"In a globalising world where the role of the local, the national and the global is shifting, the meanings of citizenship are also changing. This article presents some new theoretical discussions on gender and citizenship. It argues that, rather than something which sees everyone as ""the same"", citizenship should be understood as multi-tiered and formed through many different positions according to gender, ethnicity and urban/rural location. The author challenges the western-centric origins of citizenship theory and focuses on community membership, group rights and social difference in local, national and international contexts. In particular the article addresses the way in which the division between the family/private and the political/public operate to exclude certain groups, particularly women, from citizenship. It argues for a wider interpretation that does not concentrate solely on the relationship between people and the state. A theory of ?active citizenship? can promote participation by women and other marginalised groups in some form of decision-making. It can also ensure they receive the benefits or entitlements of community membership - such as welfare - which are needed to create the conditions in which people are able to participate. In this way citizenship can act as a ?political mobilization tool? which links up different feminist projects in local and global arenas. ";"N.

Research and policy have only recently begun to engage with the need for women to have independent rights to fields of their own. What needs to be done? Four areas for action are identified with associated strategies: improve women's claims on private land (e. g. through gender equal inheritance laws); improve women's access to public land (e.g. through land reform schemes); improve women's access to land via the market (e.g. through subsidised credit); and improve the viability of women's farming efforts (e.g. through agricultural extension services targeted at women farmers). However, even in contexts of progressive social movements and legal reforms (such as in India), the realisation of women's independent land rights has been difficult. Rights are constrained in practice by obstacles such as social biases that prevent the implementation of pro-female laws, and women's lack of effective control over land they have rights to. The best way to achieve progress is therefore through women's collective action, involving gender equality advocates in the state, political parties, and civil society organisations. ";"B.

This paper discusses the experiences of women, particularly black women, of citizenship in South Africa, where the new administration promised a new politics based on civil society and universal citizenship. It firstly discusses spaces and meanings of citizenship, arguing that the South African context can show how formal citizenship is shaped by informal power structures and social roles and therefore requires the transformation of power structures and civil society activism. It then goes on to describe how structural economic and social inequalities need to be addressed in order for women to achieve citizenship and how this will be mediated by local, national and global economic factors. Local government is identified as a possible site in which to assess gender equality measures since it is currently introducing new structures in order to become more participatory and responsive. Finally the paper discusses how issues of difference, particularly relevant to this context, can be addressed through measures such as positive action aimed at groups rather than individuals. The paper argues for notions of citizenship that acknowledge existing African understandings of human development and calls for research that will destabilise traditional male, western notions of citizenship.

"bridge:A17230";"Are wealth transfers biased against girls?: Gender differences in land inheritance and schooling investment in Ghana's western region";"";"This study attempts to analyse changing patterns of land transfer and ownership, as well as school investments by gender over three generations in customary land areas of Ghana's Western Region. Traditional inheritance rules deny land ownership rights to women. Yet the increase in the demand for women's labour due to the expansion of labour intensive cocoa cultivation has created incentives for husbands to give their wives and children land. Through this and other gift mechanisms, women have increasingly acquired land, thereby reducing the gender gap in land ownership. The gender gap in schooling has also declined significantly, though it persists. Findings suggest that changes to the increase in women's bargaining power are due to the introduction of the agricultural technology for cocoa farming, which has increased the demand for women's labour. This increasing demand for female labour as land use intensifies has, in turn, increased the transfer of land to wives and daughters. Such long-term changes have been supported by the absence of strong parental discrimination against daughters. Gender differences in schooling have been also declining in Ghana's Western Region, primarily because of declining social discrimination. Although the social and economic forces underlying such changes were not analysed as part of the study, a possible explanation is that building schools in remote villages and increasing non-farm employment opportunities for women have increased parental investments in daughters' schooling.

Do trade expansion and economic liberalisation affect women and men in different ways'? Case studies from Ghana, Uganda, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Jamaica are used in this report to illustrate some of the gender dimensions relating to trade. Present evidence suggests that, under certain conditions, export expansion can benefit certain groups of younger, more educated women. However in general, the rights of women workers to fair terms and conditions of employment need protection. This report argues that gender analysis is important for understanding trading opportunities, and that benefits of trade expansion are different for women and men.

"bridge:A52812";"Women's Informal Employment in Transition Economies";"";"Women's employment in transition countries, notably Central and Eastern Europe has become increasingly informal and flexible. The first growing trend is that women are more involved in cross-border trade, known as 'suitcase' trade, often keeping women away from home for days or months. They buy mainly consumer and household goods usually unavailable in their home countries, to sell to street vendors on their return home. The second growing trend is women's involvement in sub-contracting, particularly work such as hand sewing for the textile and shoe industries. There is a need for more data, particularly gender-disaggregated data, on both women's and men's involvement in the informal economy. States must also create more economically, politically and socially enabling environments if informal economy workers are to receive the support they need.

"bridge:A52858";"BRIDGE Report 52: Environmentally Sustainable Development and Poverty: A Gender Analysis";"";"How would environmentally sustainable development look if it was gender-sensitive? This report argues that much mainstream literature on environmentally sustainable development has ignored the gender dimensions. Where women have been the target of programmes, they have been seen as natural managers of environmental resources. A gender analysis is important because gender relations affect the ways in which poor men and women manage natural resources. Indeed, there are significant differences between women's and men's experience of poverty and environmental change due to gender inequalities in land ownership, the division of labour and decision-making powers. Effective natural resource management requires participatory approaches that take into account the different activities of household members and the impact of their different uses of natural resources on the environment. More detailed research is needed on the links between gender and environmental management. ";"S. Joekes

"bridge:A75366";"Empowering drylands women";"";"The Integrated Drylands Development Programme (IDDP) is a global UNDP initiative to promote sustainable development in the drylands, and advance the implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. This topic brief highlights the important role that gender plays in this context of sustainable development, in particular the role of women in the Arab States and Africa. In these regions, inequality and stereotypical gender norms often prevent women from contributing to the sustainable development of drylands, despite possessing a wealth of traditional knowledge and skills. To help address this, the promotion of gender equality and women’s empowerment was made a core component of the IDDP in its efforts for poverty reduction and environmental conservation in partner countries, and this brief summarises some of the results.

 

The majority of the brief describes IDDP related programmes and activities in Africa and the Arab States, and how they have helped to reduce poverty, increase resilience, and empower women. Case studies presented include: the strengthening of women’s groups in Morocco through skill-building and cooperatisation; improving energy and water access, and participation in their management, for women in Tunisia; the mainstreaming of desertification and climate change issues in Benin through the Programme to Support Drylands Development Activities, which benefited women’s energy efficiency and productivity; support for the diversification of women’s livelihoods in Kenya; and capacity-building initiatives in Tanzania that included poultry farming, tree planting, and beekeeping.

 

The brief closes by taking a look to the future, reiterating the commitment of the IDDP to scale-up its efforts toward gender equality and women’s empowerment, as per Outcome Four of the UNDP Strategic Plan for 2014-2017. In the Arab states, IDDP’s approach will be two-fold: stepping up support within country projects to better address issues concerning gender in mainstreaming, livelihoods, and natural resource management; and supporting gender specific activities in partner countries to advance women’s empowerment. In Africa, significant improvements in working conditions, income levels, and the overall status of women will be encouraged to continue through a commitment that 50% of direct beneficiaries from this programme will continue to be women. This is also in recognition of their key role in all aspects of agriculture, from cultivation to processing. Specifically, the IDDP will contribute to: enhancing women’s livelihoods; reducing wage gaps based on gender; strengthening women’s role in decision-making for drylands development; and improving women’s access to environmental goods and services.

This gender profile by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) offers a statistical overview of the condition of urban and rural women with respect to unemployment, status in the workplace, life expectancy and working and living conditions. Poverty is an ongoing concern and half the population continues to subsist below the poverty line. Rural women suffer the most with lower rates of literacy and fewer employment opportunities than urban women and men in general. More than 70 per cent of women work in unstable jobs with few benefits and low incomes. Women also experience discrimination and violence, including rape, spousal abuse, and sexual, physical, and mental abuse. Peru has committed in principle to protecting women's rights through the promotion of constitutional and legal rights, the ratification of international conventions and the establishment of a ministry to promote gender equality and women's development. Despite these commitments, women in Peru continue to experience disproportionate disadvantage because of both gender and income inequality.

This report asks how these reforms may affect women's land rights in a situation of increasing scarcity and competition for land. Reforms include the formalisation of customary land rights as private land rights as a way to ensure tenure security and equitable access to land. It warns that through this approach, women's rights may become increasingly marginalised. This would not only be in the informal family and lineage negotiations over rights and access to land. This is likely to also be in the bargaining processes related to the implementation of land reform policies and programmes. For example, in the implementation of a pilot land reform a clear gender bias in the implementation emerged, favouring men.The paper argues that:? in order to counteract these tendencies, special mechanisms that protect women against direct discrimination and more indirect processes of marginalisation should be established in Malawi;? one strategy could be to establish a stronger legal basis for the joint ownership of land by spouses or, at least, the prevention of the disposal of a household's land assets by husbands without the consent of their wives;? a second approach would involve the establishment of legal instruments so that women can maintain their rights to land upon the death of their spouses.

It argues that such understanding is vital for designing policy interventions. Control over land and income increases an individual's bargaining power. But women's contribution to families is undervalued, weakening their voice at home, access to food, and inheritance of property. Women's self-perception of this inequality has led to daily resistance strategies through secret selling of crops, hiding of rice, and pretending to be spiritually possessed in order to receive food otherwise denied to them. Strengthening women's position is the best way to increase their voice at home and in communities. Projects have successfully achieved this through providing women with access to credit and employment (e.g. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee [BRAC]), in turn increasing their self-esteem, economic security and improved treatment from husbands.

If development organisations are to help advance women's rights and full citizenship then they must abandon explanations on the basis of ?culture? that ignore gender-based discrimination, and overcome their anxieties about appearing neo-colonial. To do this, effective partnerships between northern-based development institutions and southern-based social movements are necessary since social movements can be a key means of transforming culture. Three Indian legal cases are presented to demonstrate how, despite elements of formal equality, Indian law and its Constitution do not recognise real equality. The Shah Bano (1985) case is described, where Indian law was overridden by the Prime Minister to uphold discriminatory Muslim personal law on divorce. Another case is that of Bhanwari Devi, who was raped as a form of community punishment for her feminist activism, and this was later sanctioned by formal legal systems. The court's argument that the rape could not have taken place was based on assumed cultural norms that older men do not commit rape. The final case is of a young couple who were murdered by their relatives, with the approval and participation of the community, because they were of different castes. These cases emphasise the need for strengthening north-south collaboration within development in order to support social movements that campaign for women's citizenship rights. ";"K.

"bridge:A59217";"Gender and Climate Change: Overview Report";"";"Climate change is increasingly being recognised as a global crisis, but responses to it have so far been overly focused on scientific and economic solutions. How then do we move towards more people-centred, gender-aware climate change policies and processes? How do we both respond to the different needs and concerns of women and men and challenge the gender inequalities that mean women are more likely to lose out than men in the face of climate change? This report sets out why it is vital to address the gender dimensions of climate change. It identifies key gender impacts of climate change and clearly maps the global and national policy architecture that dominates climate change responses.The report maps pathways for making climate change responses more gender aware and – potentially – transformative, arguing that gender transformation should be both a potential end goal and an important condition of effective climate change responses and poverty reduction.The report provides inspiring examples of locally relevant, gender-aware innovations from diverse global regions and contexts. Recommendations include:

    Take into account the multiple dimensions of gender inequality and women’s and men’s experiences of climate change on the ground, and invest in research to enable this.
    Move beyond simple assumptions about women’s vulnerability to highlight women’s agency in adapting to and mitigating climate change. This will involve integrating women’s valuable knowledge and practical experience into policymaking processes.
     Learn from people-focused, gender-transformative approaches at the local level and apply these lessons to national and international policy.
    Promote a rights-based approach to climate change and ensure that all future climate change policies and processes draw on human rights frameworks such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
    Find alternatives to market-based approaches where possible, but when they are used to address climate change mitigation, ensure they benefit women equally and do not exclude or further disadvantage women.
    Address the underlying causes of gender inequality, tackling issues such as unequal land rights through legislative reforms and awareness-raising, as well as through the implementation of CEDAW and other relevant frameworks.

"bridge:A52495";"Trade Liberalization: Impacts on African Women";"";"Trade liberalisation processes impact differently on men and women due to the fact that men and women have different roles in production. Despite the fact that women are actively involved in international trade, WTO agreements are gender blind and as such have adverse impacts on women. The General Agreement in Trade and Service (GATS), for instance, provides for a level playing field in service provision between big foreign owned companies and small locally owned companies. This exposes female service providers to unfair competition from foreign service providers in sectors such as education and health. Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) also advocate for liberalisation of investment, which ensures equal treatment to local and foreign investors. This has a serious impact on women, as they are concentrated in small and medium enterprises, resulting in implications for women's access to land and other resources. The first part of this paper presents an analysis of the impacts of WTO agreements on women in developing countries. Provisions of specific agreements the impacts on women are outlined. The second and main section of the paper is a compilation of case studies on the impacts of trade liberalisation on women in Africa.

"bridge:A54382";"Widows, AIDS, Health and Human Rights in Africa";"";"This paper argues that widows and female children in Tanzania have traditionally been denied the right to inherit property from their husbands, even when the property was acquired during the marriage. This is further complicated by a three-part legal system consisting of customary law (law grounded in customs or traditions), Islamic law, and statutory law (law set down by a legislature). As a result, Tanzanian women and their children are often left homeless upon the death of their husbands. This discrimination persists despite Tanzania's commitment to securing equality for women under its own constitution, and under international laws and conventions such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights. This paper sets out the case for legal reform in Tanzania, with a focus on women's access to inheritance rights. It also argues that the issue of women's inheritance rights provides an opportunity to assess the efficacy of legislation as a tool to guarantee women's rights and change longstanding social practices.

Gender, land and decentralisation in Niger";"";"This study aims to identify how women's capacity to become more involved in decision-making at the local level can be strengthened, particularly in terms of access to natural resources. It also aims to identify the structures through which women secure their systems of production. It focuses on the situation in Niger, where women are increasingly excluded from dominant systems of production: in agricultural areas, they are increasingly excluded from agricultural production and in pastoralist areas, they have lost their herds and had to resort to agriculture. This had devastating effects on their livelihoods, their social and economic opportunities and on their extended family who often take on extra work and responsibilities and suffer from food insecurity. Women have traditionally gained access to land through a customary practice of borrowing land, which is also under threat. New ways to access land (e.g. pledges and purchases) have mainly been used by a minority of better-off and better-informed women. A system of land commissions is facilitating the legalisation of land transaction but it often clashes with traditional systems for regulating modes of access to land like loans and donations. The model of female leadership is also in crisis as their exclusion from the dominant system of production no longer allows them to achieve social status and well-being. ";"M. Diarra

For example, limited access to productive resources such as land, seed and fertiliser means that women may be unable to benefit from the expansion of trade in agricultural products. In fact, it has been calculated that agricultural productivity could increase by up to 20 percent if women's access to these resources were equal to men's. This paper - an outcome of the eight meeting of the African Partnership Forum - provides an overview of the status of women's economic empowerment in Africa, outlines international and regional commitments on gender equality and empowerment, and proposes concrete recommendations for African governments and development partners to translate these commitments into action. On land and property rights, it urges development partners to support African governments to establish clear legislative frameworks for protecting the rights of women to own and inherit land. This should be combined with advocacy and education to challenge deep-rooted cultural norms and practices which underlie discrimination in land tenure in Africa. Other recommendations include providing targeted support to women entrepreneurs managing small and micro-enterprises to enable them to expand into the formal sector; creating investment funds for women; and promoting gender-sensitive legislation on family rights.

"bridge:A52724";"Contested Terrain: Oxfam, Gender, and the Aftermath of War";"";"The topic of gender relations in the context of conflict covers highly sensitive terrain, not only within the war-torn society, but for intervening institutions. Like other international humanitarian agencies, Oxfam Great Britain (GB) has faced difficult questions about whether its presence has sometimes done more harm than good. External agencies also have to ask themselves whether their interventions impact negatively on women and gender relations. Generally, ideas about the importance of harmonising short-term help with long-term goals are not realised in practice and this has serious implications for gender power dynamics. Oxfam GB has a number of sets of guidelines and standards relating to gender for its emergency programming and while these have been implemented successfully in some instances, they are not routinely applied.Oxfam GB's programme in Kosovo revealed how conceptual and programmatic divides make implementation complicated and difficult. These divisions have critical implications for gender equity goals in responses to conflict and its aftermath:•Relief versus development responses - this divide persisted in policy and practice despite an acknowledgement that longer-term prospects for the survivors of conflict should influence relief efforts.• Conflict versus post-conflict contexts - the Kosovo intervention did not take into account that conflict-prone societies experience cyclical dynamics of turbulence and peace, rather than a linear progression from conflict to peace.• Technical versus social interventions - the emergency situation in Kosovo was not considered an appropriate setting in which to address gender relations because challenging gender power relations is difficult and does not produce obvious tangible results. Therefore, questions about the impact of technical interventions on gender relations were not considered.Such divides also created tension between those working on short-term goals and those working on a long-term timeline, particularly as funds were largely focused on short-term relief and technical work. Due to perceptions of the 'private/domestic' as separate from the 'public' sphere and their associated gender ideologies, interventions were focused on the 'public' without consideration for the link with and impact on 'private' issues.To overcome these limitations, the Oxfam report recommends:• The systematic integration of gender equity goals within all aspects of emergency response programming. This would help to establish greater coherence between immediate emergency relief and longer-term recovery work.• Clear analysis of the dynamics between violence and conflict and the maintenance of gender identities, interests and power. For example, a clearer understanding of the links between gendered violence and armed conflict would help Oxfam GB overcome the divide between the private and the public spheres and direct its programmes towards peace and human security at all levels, from the household to the nation.Gender standards for humanitarian response have since been developed by the Oxfam Humanitarian Department and have been used in the post-conflict Sierra Leone and Angola, as well as other humanitarian responses in Cambodia, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, West Bengal and Mozambique.

"bridge:A52846";"Shadow Report, Ethiopia 2003 (Executive Summary)";"";"This shadow report, produced by NEWA and EWLA, offers a critique of the Ethiopian government's CEDAW report by looking at three broad areas: economic and socio-cultural status of women, equality in marriage and family relations and violence against women. The report acknowledges the considerable efforts made by the Ethiopian government to address its CEDAW obligations, but cites weak enforcement, poor policy guidelines and a lack of institutional commitment as ongoing problems. Without gender-disaggregated data, and without proper follow-up on government initiatives, it is impossible to know the impact these changes are having. Women in Ethiopia are still disproportionately disadvantaged, with most working in the informal sector. Under-representation of women in the public sphere is also cited as problematic. Changes in education policy are not translating into improved enrolments, with sizeable gaps in the male-female ratio in primary and secondary schools persisting. Women's concerns in relation to health are overlooked, including areas such as contraception, maternal care and HIV/AIDS. The elimination of legal discrimination against women through changes to family law is a significant step forward, although there are still gaps in divorce law and little enforcement to protect women against violence.

"bridge:A52821";"An Analysis of the WTO-AOA Review from the Perspective of Rural Women in Asia";"";"How does the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) affect the livelihoods of rural women in Asia? This paper, prepared on the occasion of the WTO-AOA review in 2003, analyzes the impact of the new trading rules imposed by the WTO on Asian peasants. It illustrates the inherent imbalances in the WTO-AOA's trade liberalisation policies which, among other things, flood local markets with highly subsidized agricultural imports from developed countries to the detriment of domestic agriculture. These trade rules have devastated local agriculture, caused widespread unemployment, and worsened rural poverty, particularly for women. Displaced from farming, while still responsible for their families' survival, unskilled rural women are forced to accept temporary low paying jobs in the informal sector or to migrate to cities and foreign countries to perform menial jobs. The paper issues a proposal for action to reverse the negative impact of trade liberalisation policies. This includes a call on women's groups to hold national governments accountable to the concessions they made under the AOA, and to pressure their governments to reverse the policies which harm small farmers and rural women.

"bridge:A52822";"Rulemaking and Governance for Trade Intensification Asian Women's Views";"";"This economic literacy pack, the third in this series, is a tool for educating local women's constituencies on trade rules and negotiations. It explores four main themes, firstly 'How the WTO Treats National Health Emergencies in the Rubric of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)'. This section demonstrates how the agreement protects the patent interests of private pharmaceutical firms based in developed countries, while jeopardizing the public health of the poor in developing countries. This is done through, for example, denying disadvantaged groups in the South, particularly women, access to cheaper generic copies of lifesaving medicines for HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria treatment that are produced in developed countries. Other themes are 'The Myth of Market Access in the Agreement on Agriculture (AOA)'; 'Entitlement to Food: the Alternative to Market Access'; and 'From Free Trade to Human Freedom'. The pack also contains a literature review of select IGTN resources from Asia, Latin America, the US and Africa.

"bridge:A54061";"Human Security and Aboriginal Women in Canada";"";"Aboriginal women in Canada are at the forefront of resistance when it comes to threats to their land and culture. This is the conclusion of this study, which examines the links between Aboriginal women, protest and human security. The study shows that restrictions on fishing rights, expansion in logging, and ski-resort development are being fiercely fought by Aboriginal women. They stand in front of trains, blockade roads and mobilise demonstrations and this often results in clashes with authorities and police violence. Aboriginal women both use and challenge their gender roles. They fight to protect their children's rights as traditional home keepers and life givers and preservers and at the same time challenge traditional ideas of motherhood when they argue for their need to be absent from home. The study concludes with a look at Bill C-36, new Canadian anti-terrorist legislation that increases police powers and curbs civil rights to protest. The report argues that this legislation could be used to further repress Aboriginal protest and recommends that Aboriginal communities be exempt from this law. ";"C. Deiter

"bridge:A54336";"Gender Justice in Sub-Saharan Africa";"";"This paper presents an overview of key issues in the literature on gender justice in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Issues discussed include the exclusion of women from full citizenship status; gender inequalities in property relations, family relations and access to justice; and disregard for women's and men's sexual and reproductive health and rights. The paper goes on to reflect on the links between research and advocacy on women's rights in the region, noting the decline over the past decade in academic research capacity in African universities, including in gender and women's studies departments. The need for better dissemination and visibility of literature generated by research and advocacy in the region is also seen as a problem. Initiatives by key donors in sub-Saharan Africa to address gender injustices are outlined, including initiatives by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Fund for Women and the Ford Foundation. Lastly, a region-wide assessment of the key achievements in, and challenges to, achieving and institutionalising gender justice is provided - particularly highlighting the passage of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa as a major achievement.

"bridge:A54322";"BRIDGE Bibliography 19: Putting gender back in the picture: rethinking women's economic empowerment - overview and annotated bibliography";"";"Current momentum around women's economic empowerment offers huge scope for bringing about real changes in women's lives. But earning an income or having access to credit cannot be assumed to bring automatic benefits for women. We need to ask critical questions about how increased access to resources can be translated into changes in the strategic choices that women are able to make - at the level of the household and community, as well as at work. What of the terms on which women gain access to resources - are these empowering or exploitative? And what are the impacts of women's greater access to resources on gender relations and norms more broadly? The first section of this resource provides an overview which explores the dominant analysis taking hold around women's economic empowerment and highlights critical issues that remain as yet on the margins of debate and action. It seeks to promote a nuanced understanding of the gendered barriers that prevent some women from benefiting from economic opportunities or from being empowered despite access to these opportunities. It goes on to suggest a practical starting point for overcoming some of these barriers: tackling the 'double burden' of paid work and care work that is shouldered by so many women. The second section provides an annotated bibliography of useful, relevant and timely resources related to the issues covered in the overview. Summaries and publication details of each resource are included in the bibliography. ";"A. Brody

"bridge:A52729";"Guidelines for Integrating Gender Analysis into Biodiversity Research";"";"How can gender be mainstreamed into programmes concerned with the sustainable use and management of biodiversity? The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) has produced guidelines on how to integrate gender analysis into biodiversity research. The central role played by women in the maintenance of rural lands, and changing gender roles and relations resulting from cost of living rises and increased migration, are highlighted. Women are not simply working within the household but also assume roles such as farmers, gatherers, health care providers, drawers of water, food processors, market vendors, and soil conservationists. Biodiversity management therefore is not simply about equitably managing farms, forests and other public spaces. It also involves identifying and addressing the power imbalances and gender dynamics of the household, the markets where both women and men buy and sell their produce, and the nature and function of local organisations and social networks where women and men come together to share resources and information on biodiversity.
