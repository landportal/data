"OSF_preprint:460F9-5BE-C17";"Checkerboards and Coase: Transactions Costs and Efficiency in Land Markets";"";"The Coase theorem emphasizes the role transactions costs play in efficient market outcomes. We document inefficient outcomes, in the presence of a transactions cost, in southern California land markets and the corresponding transition to efficient outcomes after the transactions cost is eliminated. In the late 1800s, Palm Springs, CA was evenly divided, in a checkerboard fashion, and property rights assigned in alternating blocks to the Agua Caliente tribe and a non-Indian landowner by the US Federal government. Sales and leasing restrictions on the Agua Caliente land created a large transactions cost to development on those lands; consequently, we observe very little housing investment. Non-Indian lands provide a benchmark for efficient outcomes for the Agua Caliente lands. Once the transactions cost for Agua Caliente lands was removed, there is a convergence between American Indian-owned and non Indian-owned lands in both the number of homes constructed and the value of those homes. land markets, coase theorem, economic development";"Randall Akee";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2014-11-20";"en";"land;land markets";"Land & Investments";"NOR";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F9-5BE-C17";"ftp://repec.iza.org/RePEc/Discussionpaper/dp2438.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""

The analysis demonstrates that the agricultural suitability index does not capture the large variation in the potential caloric yield across equally suitable land, reflecting the fact that land suitable for agriculture is not necessarily suitable for the most caloric-intensive crops. Hence, in light of the instrumental role played by caloric yield in sustaining and supporting population growth, and given importance of pre-industrial population density for the subsequent course of economic development, the Caloric Suitability Index dominates the conventional measure in capturing the effect of land productivity on pre-colonial population density and the subsequent course of economic development.

We hypothesize that corruption indeed leads to more land deals. We argue that corrupt elites exploit poor institutional setups (characterized by corruption) to strike deals with domestic and international investors at the expense of the local population. Using panel data for 156 countries from 2000-2011, we provide evidence that large-scale land deals indeed occur more often in countries with higher levels of corruption. The estimated effects are also economically substantive and particularly relevant to economies with unsound institutions. large-scale land acquisitions, land grabbing, foreign investments, weak institutions, corruption";"Matthias Bujko

"OSF_preprint:461CF-F5E-9BB";"An svm multiclassifier approach to land cover mapping";"";"From the advent of the application of satellite imagery to land cover mapping, one of the growing areas of research interest has been in the area of image classification. Image classifiers are algorithms used to extract land cover information from satellite imagery. Most of the initial research has focussed on the development and application of algorithms to better existing and emerging classifiers. In this paper, a paradigm shift is proposed whereby a committee of classifiers is used to determine the final classification output. Two of the key components of an ensemble system are that there should be diversity among the classifiers and that there should be a mechanism through which the results are combined. In this paper, the members of the ensemble system include: Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM and Quadratic SVM. The final output was determined through a simple majority vote of the individual classifiers. From the results obtained it was observed that the final derived map generated by an ensemble system can potentially improve on the results derived from the individual classifiers making up the ensemble system. The ensemble system classification accuracy was, in this case, better than the linear and quadratic SVM result. It was however less than that of the RBF SVM. Areas for further research could focus on improving the diversity of the ensemble system used in this research. Comment: ASPRS 2008 Annual Conference Portland, Oregon.

"OSF_preprint:4607B-BC0-CDA";"Drivers of global variation in land ownership";"";"Land ownership shapes natural resource management and social-ecological resilience, but the factors determining ownership norms in human societies remain unclear. Here we conduct a global empirical test of long-standing theories from ecology, economics, and anthropology regarding potential drivers of land ownership and territoriality. Prior theory suggests that resource defensibility, subsistence strategies, population pressure, political complexity, and cultural transmission mechanisms may all influence land ownership. We applied multi-model inference procedures based on logistic regression to cultural and environmental data from 102 societies, 71 with some form of land ownership and 31 with no land ownership. We found an increased probability of land ownership in mountainous environments, where patchy resources may be more cost effective to defend via ownership. We also uncovered support for the role of population pressure, with a greater probability of land ownership in societies living at higher population densities. Our results also show more land ownership when neighboring societies also practiced ownership. We found less support for variables associated with subsistence strategies and political complexity.";"Claire Bowern

"OSF_preprint:4605E-F78-C7D";"Centrality of land and real estate dynamics in China through the prism of the Developmental State Centralité du foncier et dynamiques immobilières en Chine au prisme de l’Etat Développeur";"";"This paper engages in a discussion between regulationists and urban scientists with the aim of bringing awareness ofthe growing role of property markets as drivers of contemporaneous capitalist regimes — a dimension that has notbeen given proper consideration by the French Regulation School. The case of China exemplifies the centrality of landin macroeconomic dynamics. The paper explores this centrality trough the prism of the Development State (DS), aframework that sets China's experience in the broader context of Northeast Asia. Three main characteristics ofJohnson’s DS framework are mobilized to highlight the role of property value enhancement in the regime of capitalaccumulation in China, i.e. the state’s productivist approach, the main bank system and a nationalistic ethos ineconomy. It is argued that the state (at both central and local levels) has used the mechanism of property valueenhancement as a major tool to ensure a smoother economic transition. By keeping the ‘main bank system’ andavoiding the development of financial markets, it has created a dual track financing system of urban production,evidenced by the process of ‘landed urbanization’ (Li, 2014) and the proliferation of grey finance. To keep the landrent under control, foreign investment had to be restricted despite the strong focus put by local governments oninternational design in urban (re) development. Cet article engage un dialogue entre les régulationnistes et des spécialistes de l'urbain afin que les dynamiques foncièreset immobilières, grandes impensées de la Régulation, puissent trouver leur juste place dans l'analyse des régimescapitalistes contemporains. Le cas de la Chine apparaît particulièrement emblématique du rôle central que peut prendrela valorisation foncière dans un modèle de croissance. Cet article l'aborde au prisme du Developmental State (DS), uncadre d'analyse qui resitue l'expérience chinoise dans son contexte régional. Trois grands aspects de la théorie deJohson (1982) sont mobilisés ici pour mettre en lumière le rôle de la valorisation foncière dans le processusd'accumulation du capital en Chine : l'approche productiviste de l'Etat, le système de la banque principale et lenationalisme économique. L'approche par le DS révèle l'usage de l'inflation foncière comme base de la politiquemacro-économique de l'Etat chinois à travers la promotion de l'investissement résidentiel comme véhicule privilégié deplacement. Le maintien du système de banque principal et les freins au développement des marchés financiers ontgénéré un système de financement dual de la production urbaine ainsi qu’en témoigne le processus de ‘landedurbanization’ (Li, 2014) et la prolifération de la finance grise. Pour garder le contrôle de la rente foncière, l’Etat arestreint l’investissement étranger en dépit de l’internationalité affichée des nouveaux projets urbains.";"Natacha Aveline-Dubach

"OSF_preprint:46171-FE6-4F0";"National REDD+ outcompetes gold and logging: the potential of cleaning profit chains.";"";"While the potential contribution of a nationally implemented program for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) to developing countries’ budgets remains as yet obscure, two general concerns are that REDD+ will i) incentivize land grabbing and ii) remain financially uncompetitive against current commercial forest uses. However, based on data from Guyana’s, United Nations-approved, Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) submission and national documents, we found that i) national REDD+ appears not to place value on forest, but financial penalties on forest damage, and ii) would be competitive when viewed from the perspective of the owner of the natural resources (national society), even against high value commodities such as gold and timber (the country’s main emission drivers), and at an intermediate US$5 carbon price. Hidden by the latter is a very skewed sharing of net revenue between the state and private sector supply chains (~1:99). Weak law enforcement, common across the tropics, enhances skewed sharing, and linked political leverage likely undermines any plans that would interfere with private income streams, including rural development, land tenure and conservation plans. We suggest that government or electorate pressure towards more equitable revenue sharing, i.e. ‘cleaning profit chains’, would both be justified and worthwhile, and unlikely to produce job losses. Investing this homegrown finance in better management and law enforcement of finite natural resources (under REDD+, including forests) could return significant REDD+ income while mitigating climate change and aiding rights of forest-dependent livelihoods. Along with cleaning supply chains and moving commodities out of natural forest areas, assessing and cleaning private profit chains may more generally be a promising approach for REDD+ and climate mitigation goals, along with its many associated social and environmental co-benefits.";"José M V Fragoso

This time round, a more nuanced theme combining the classic goals of enhancing tenure security, improving investment and productivity of land with those of poverty reduction and equity in land access. Many continue to question the neo-classical premise which perceives customary systems to not provide the necessary security to promote agricultural investment and productivity due to the lack of clearly defined private and enforceable property rights. Given the variety of methods used measuring land tenure security it would be useful to examine how the different measures of tenure security influence the outcomes of interest within the premise of the neo-classical hypothesis. This paper examines how diffrent methods of quantifying and measuring tenure security influence farm investment.

This remarkable situation has known major changes since 2009. In three years, 5.5 million hectares, which is more than 10 % of the terrestrial mass of the country, were yielded via concessions to (mainly foreign) companies. The mechanism used for the most recent acquisitions is known under the name of Special Agricultural and Business Lease (SABL), which was conceived at first to make it possible for the tribes to yield part of their grounds to companies for the development of agricultural projects. Battling against the “scandal of the SABL” and severe criticisms towards the cut-price selling of as many grounds in so little time, the Government set up in 2011 an independent committee of inquiry with for mission of re-examining the 72 concessions granted via the system of the SABL.

"OSF_preprint:4619C-213-315";"Continuous separation of land use and climate effects on the past and future water balance";"";"Understanding the combined and separate effects of climate and land use change on the water cycle is necessary to mitigate negative impacts. However, existing methodologies typically divide data into discrete (before and after) periods, implicitly representing climate and land use as step changes when in reality these changes are often gradual. Here, we introduce a new regression-based methodological framework designed to separate climate and land use effects on any hydrological flux of interest continuously through time, and estimate uncertainty in the contribution of these two drivers. We present two applications in the Yahara River watershed (Wisconsin, USA) demonstrating how our approach can be used to understand synergistic or antagonistic relationships between land use and climate in either the past or the future: (1) historical streamflow, baseflow, and quickflow in an urbanizing subwatershed; and (2) simulated future evapotranspiration, drainage, and direct runoff from a suite of contrasting climate and land use scenarios for the entire watershed. In the historical analysis, we show that ~60% of recent streamflow changes can be attributed to climate, with approximately equal contributions from quickflow and baseflow. However, our continuous method reveals that baseflow is significantly increasing through time, primarily due to land use change and potentially influenced by long-term increases in groundwater storage. In the simulation of future changes, we show that all components of the future water balance will respond more strongly to changes in climate than land use, with the largest potential land use effects on drainage. These results indicate that diverse land use change trajectories may counteract each other while the effects of climate are more homogeneous at watershed scales. Therefore, management opportunities to counteract climate change effects will likely be more effective at smaller spatial scales, where land use trajectories are unidirectional.";"Melissa Motew

In Nepal, in response to massive deforestation, the community forestry program has been implemented to reduce deforestation and support livelihoods. After four decades of its inception, the effectiveness of this program on forest cover change remains mostly unknown. This study analyses the spatial and temporal patterns of tree cover change along with a few socio-economic drivers of tree cover change to examine the effectiveness of the community forestry program for conserving forests or in reducing deforestation. We also investigate the socio-economic factors and policy responses as manifested through the community forestry program responsible for the tree cover change at the district level. The total tree cover area in the year 2000 in Nepal was ~ 4,746,000 hectares, and our analysis reveals that between 2001 and 2016, Nepal has lost ~46,000 ha and gained ~12,300 ha of areas covered by trees with a substantial spatial and temporal variations. After accounting socio-economic drivers of forest cover change, our analysis showed that districts with the larger number of community forests had a minimum loss in tree cover, while districts with higher proportion of vegetation covered by community forests had a maximum gain in tree cover. This indicates a positive contribution of the community forestry program to reducing deforestation and increasing tree cover.";"Kamal Bawa

But what does “reclaiming the commons” entail? A longue-durée genealogy reveals distinct socio-legal imaginations of the commons and visions of how it might be reclaimed. Social thinkers and reformers have split over how to address the key problem of private property identified by John Locke: landless people who can’t find paid employment. One vision, proposed by Thomas Jefferson, would reclaim the commons by activating space – reuniting the unemployed with unused land. Another, proposed by Thomas Paine, takes such a reunion as impracticable; it would reclaim the commons by taxing property and transferring the proceeds. The genealogical analysis helps understand contemporary urban agriculture as consistent with a Jeffersonian “land fix” mode of reclaiming the commons, and by contrast to state-led “tax fix” strategies for addressing unemployment and poverty.";"Nate Ela";"";"Center for Open Science";"Center for Open Science";"2018-11-16";"en";"common lands;land use;property;property rights;usufruct";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land Conflicts;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46195-D26-9F0";"http://osf.io/ruwbp/download";"";"";"";"";"";""

"OSF_preprint:4615E-390-244";"Strengthening the State: Logging and Neoliberal Politics in East New Britain, Papua New Guinea";"";"In this paper I will examine how logging in Papua New Guinea affects the relationship between the state and the local communities on whose lands logging operations take place. The point of departure of my argument is the Ili- Wawas Integrated Project, a combined logging and agricultural project which seeks to bring economic development to the remote Pomio district of East New Britain Province by connecting existing logging roads to the limited national road network around the provincial capital. Developing the national road network and creating standardized or—to use James Scott’s concept—legible environments can be seen as an integral part of state-making and strengthening the role of the state. In addition to the environment, the state also needs to make social life legible in forms of maps, censuses and laws. As I will argue in my paper, the Ili-Wawas, and other similar projects, may indeed strengthen the role of the state not only by creating the infrastructure and legibility needed by the state, but also in unintended and accidental ways. The side effects of logging and road building include, among others, fear of crime and land disputes. It is these that create among the locals a perceived need for state institutions, which may be as significant in advancing the role of the state as is the creation of infrastructure and legibility.";"Tuomas Tammisto";"";"Center for Open Science";"Center for Open Science";"2018-12-14";"en";"development;land dispute";"Land Conflicts;Land in Post-Conflict Settings;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"PNG";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615E-390-244";"http://osf.io/zj763/download";"";"";"";"";"";""

In this paper we identify sources of externalities in Australian sugar cane production and examine ways to enhance greater environmental compliance by canegrowers who have agreed to a voluntary Code of Practice for sustainable cane production. The rationale for developing bestpractice management options to mitigate environmental consequences of cane farming is explored using land management options for cane production in acid sulfate sensitive soils in the northern NSW coastal region as an example. This will form the basis for a detailed investigation of catchment-wide management strategies to mitigate the risks associated with farming on acid sulphate soils.";"Mike Grundy

Intuitively, an ensemble system should consist of base classifiers which are diverse i.e. classifiers whose decision boundaries err differently. In this paper ensemble feature selection is used to impose diversity in ensembles. The features of the constituent base classifiers for each ensemble were created through an exhaustive search algorithm using different separability indices. For each ensemble, the classification accuracy was derived as well as a diversity measure purported to give a measure of the inensemble diversity. The correlation between ensemble classification accuracy and diversity measure was determined to establish the interplay between the two variables. From the findings of this paper, diversity measures as currently formulated do not provide an adequate means upon which to constitute ensembles for land cover mapping. Comment: 6 pages";"B. Abe

"OSF_preprint:46004-37B-7F2";"Land dispute resolution in Mozambique: institutions and evidence of agroforestry technology adoption";"";"Successful adoption of natural resource management technologies requires that important fundamentals of property rights be established. Because disputes over property rights occur universally, the ability to successfully defend one's rights to property exercises a central influence on the tenure security necessary for technology adoption. However, defending rights to property rests upon the possession of evidence that is readily available and widely regarded as legitimate. This paper presents work carried out in postwar Mozambique on the availability and legitimacy of evidence pertaining to land tenure dispute resolution. What is unusual about the Mozambique case is that the physical presence of a natural resource management technology—agroforestry trees in this case—also serves as one of the most widely available and legitimate forms of evidence in the postwar period. Such an arrangement reveals important aspects about the reverse relationship between property rights and technology adoption. While such an evidence role for a technology may at first appear to encourage further adoption of agroforestry, important influences on property rights in the postwar setting serve to discourage full adoption and jeopardize the long-term presence of existing agroforestry trees. It remains to be seen if recent legislative changes regarding property rights will successfully engage customary forms of evidence and encourage full adoption of agroforestry in Mozambique.

The paper seeks to identify and analyze the kinds of institutional arrangements that might be deployed to support indigenous communities in the management of indigenous-owned land. It is concerned with a particular planning context in which the role of state agencies is focused on supporting and facilitating the work of indigenous landowners. This paper considers how best to arrange the institutional systems and processes of the nation state to support the management of indigenous lands management by their indigenous owners. To this end, the paper interrogates the utility of three models of planning: (1) institutional-regulatory, (2) community-based planning, and (3) reticulist, or facilitated process, approaches. The paper identifies the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches and argues for the development of a hybrid approach that integrates the positive features of all three models. The paper concludes that this hybrid model offers a set of institutional arrangements that enable collaborative planning between indigenous peoples and institutions of the state.

"OSF_preprint:460D5-2DB-2E7";"Option values on periurban land markets";"";"We study the developable land market in French periurban and rural areas under urban influence. Theoretical aspects and empirical results are derived from urban economics to analyse the main determinants of the price of developable land: distance from the urban centres, population, inhabitantsí income, etc. We focus especially on option values that come from irreversibility of development of farmland into residential plots, with uncertainly and inflow of information from the market. The classical option value, due to temporal price volatility (íprice riskî), is introduced into an econometric model. The novel contribution of the paper is to introduce also uncertainly regarding the spatial volatility of the demographic evolution in a spatial buffer around each transaction (ípopulation riskî), which generates a second option value. We use three individual data sets that describe the market of developable land: a very complete database available for the North department3 (31551 observations from 1989 to 2003); comparisons are made with two others database available for the CÃ™te-díOr department (3303 observations) and the Toulouse region (10293 observations). We use an econometric random effects model: random variables capture the effects of unobservable or omitted variables characterising each commune (level 2 of the French Local Administrative Units) or urban areas (commuting or shopping zones). Price uncertainly is introduced from the classical approach of a Brownian movement with drift (Dixit et Pindyck, 1994; cf. discussion in Cunningham, 2006): the conversion decision is made from the observed variability of the residential land price during the preceding months. We model in the same way the ípopulation riskî: it depends on population evolution in neighbouring communes between the population censuses of 1982 and 1999; the price of waiting for more information from migrations when population is fluctuating turns into an option value capitalized into the price of developable land. The findings show, on the one hand, the decreasing slope of the price of developable plots according to both distance from urban centres and distance from the centre of each commune, the role of population and of its evolution, etc. On the other hand, significant option values appear. They are linked, first, to the íprice riskî. In the Nord department, when the standard deviation of the price of developable plots during the six previous quarters rises by a standard deviation, the land price increase by 7.4% during the downward period of the real estate cycle (1989-1997) and in 15.3% during the upward period (1998-2002). Option values also are linked to the ípopulation riskî: prices significantly rise with population volatility. In the Nord department, during the upward period, an increase by one standard deviation of the standard deviation of 1982-1999 population variation entails an increase by 6% of the developable land price.";"Pierre Wavresky

Collected statistical data serve as a basis for domestic decision making and provide the foundation of strategy formulation in rural development, agro-environmental protection and sustainable agriculture. In the course of our research, analyses based on statistical databases were used to assess land use changes and land market prices. The structural survey of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office in 2013 shows that the proportion of business organisations utilising arable land grew 7 percentage points while individual farms increased their share by 2 percentage points.

A new methodology to deal with ILUC effects is developed, using a transition matrix of land uses calibrated with Agricultural Censuses data. Agriculture and land use are modeled separately in each of 15 Brazilian regions with different agricultural mix. This regional detail captures a good deal of the differences in soil, climate and history that cause particular land to be used for particular purposes. Brazilian land area data distinguish three broad types of agricultural land use, Crop, Pasture, and Plantation Forestry. Between one year and the next the model allows land to move between those categories, or for Unused land to convert to one of these three, driven initially by the transition matrix, changing land supply for agriculture between years. The transition matrix shows Markov probabilities that a particular hectare of land used in one year for some use would be in an other use next period. These probabilities are modified endogenously in the model according to the average unit rentals of each land type in each region. A simulation with ethanol expansion scenario is performed for year 2020, in which land supply is allowed to increase only in states located on the agricultural frontier. Results show that the ILUC effects of ethanol expansion are of the order of 0.14 hectare of new land coming from previously unused land for each new hectare of sugar cane. This value is higher than values found in the Brazilian literature. ILUC effects for pastures are around 0.47. Finally, regional differences in sugarcane productivity are found to be important elements in ILUC effects of sugar cane expansion.";"Mark Horridge

We use an overlapping generations model with two sectors: an agricultural sector and a manufacturing sector. Land is specific to the agricultural sector and capital goods are specific to the manufacturing sector. Moreover land is a fixed production factor. Saving takes the form of either land or capital goods purchases, and saving composition depends on transaction costs generated by land tenure insecurity. It is shown that land tenure insecurity implies a decrease in land prices and a reallocation of savings in favour of capital goods. Two econometric restrictions can be tested on a panel of the Brazilian federation states: land tenure insecurity has a negative impact on land prices and a positive one on economic growth. Land tenure insecurity is proxied by the number of squatters. These two restrictions are not rejected.

Unfortunately, mangrove loss and degradation occur at alarming rates. Regardless of the protection and close monitoring of mangrove ecosystems in Mexico during the last two decades, mangrove degradation and the loss of biodiversity is still ongoing. In some regions, unregulated and unsustainable mangrove wood harvesting are important causes of degradation. In this context, community-based mangrove forestry through Management Units for Wildlife Conservation could be a cost-effective alternative scheme to manage and conserve mangrove forests, their ecosystem services and biological diversity within and beyond protected areas while providing sustainable local livelihoods and helping reduce illegal logging. The objective of the Management Units is to promote alternative means of production with the rational and planned use of renewable resources based on Management Plans. If implemented with a multidisciplinary perspective that incorporates scientific assessments this conservation strategy may contribute to achieving national and international environmental and biodiversity agreements providing multiple social, ecological and economic benefits from local to global scales.";"Ignacio Valdez Hernández

"OSF_preprint:46071-CE3-C81";"Biofuels and Land Use Change";"";"Biofuels may make a substantial contribution to meeting the world’s energy needs. That contribution may come sooner and be greater if there is a strong climate policy to reduce greenhouse gases and biofuels can be produced in a way that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate the land use implications of biofuels under different policy conditions using a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy that has been adapted to explicitly consider land use change. We find that to meet a substantial portion of the worlds liquid fuel needs a global area approximately equal to that of today’s cropland would be needed. As much as two-thirds of the land could come from intensification of existing land, especially pastureland. Conversion of forests and the loss of natural ecosystems and carbon dioxide emissions associated with land use change present a substantial risk. We also find that comparative advantage in biofuels likely rests in the tropics despite belief in the US that biofuels could be a domestic source of energy, freeing us from imports. An attempt to meet US fuel needs through a domestic biofuels program would likely mean the US would become a major food importer and would contribute to higher land and food prices in the US.

Toulouse catastrophe in 2011 has been an illustrative example as it strongly impacted highway users. Therefore, transport infrastructure users (Roads and railways mainly) represent a population to be protected within a land use planning policy as it is the case for inhabitants. Accordingly, this paper presents a decision support approach aiming to help local stakeholders identifying the most cost effective measures to protect transport infrastructures from major accidental consequences. The suggested approach takes in account both technical and participatory constraints with the aim of offering an equal chance to all involved stakeholders to understand the issues under discussion and formulate opinions and values. After a description of the French regulatory context, the major technical difficulties related to transport infrastructures protection will be described before introducing the main technical choices adopted by the team. Finally, a decision support procedure is described and a real case study presented. This work is strongly embedded in the French regulatory context.

Kebakaran hutan yang melanda Indonesia yaitu di wilayah Kalimantan dan juga Riau diakibatkan oleh adanya kegiatan land clearing. Selain itu kebakaran hutan dan lahan juga dipicu karena adanya kekeringan panjang yang melanda Indonesia. Land Clearing adalah kegiatan pembersihan lahan yang dimulai dari pemotongan pohon, pembabatan ilalang, dan pembakaran sampai lahan siap untuk digunakan. Sampai saat ini polisi sudah menetapkan 345 orang tersangka dan 17 korporasi yang diduga terlibat dalam pembakaran hutan dan lahan. Bahkan perusahaan asing yaitu Singapura dan Malaysia diduga juga ikut terlibat. Banyak warga yang mulai terserang penyakit, khususnya penyakit pernafasan yang diakibatkan karena asap yang semakin tebal setiap harinya. Relawan dibantu oleh Para warga dalam memadamkan titik api agar tidak semakin meluas. Setelah sekian lama titik api berangsur angsur mulai berkurang karena hujan mulai mengguyur Kalimantan dan Riau walaupun belum merata ke semua wilayah. Gotong royong adalah kegiatan yang dilakukan untuk menyelesaikan suatu hal secara bersama sama tanpa mengharapkan suatu imbalan. Hal ini dapat kita lihat saat masyarakat Indonesia saling bergotong royong dalam memadamkan kebakaran hutan dan lahan yang terjadi di wilayah Kalimantan dan Riau. Mereka membantu tanpa membedakan ras, suku, dan agama. Inilah yang diinginkan oleh Soekarno agar masyarakat Indonesia saling bergotong royong karena merupakan ciri khas Indonesia.";"Disky Krisdianti";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2019-12-04";"en";"land clearing";"Land & Investments;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"IDN";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46025-CB5-C0F";"http://osf.io/arq4w/download";"";"";"";"";"";""

Heterogeneity in the Valuation of Community Forestry Programs?";"";"Through the implementation of a choice experiment valuation exercise, this study set out to identify the set of community plantation attributes that impact the welfare of potential community forestry program participants. We employed a combination of choice models to evaluate the preferences, welfare impacts and choice elasticities associated with alternative community forestry programs, allowing for different assumptions regarding heterogeneity. In line with economic theory, increased participation costs reduced the demand for community forestry, while increases in expected productivity raised the demand. With respect to preferences for the other alternatives considered - type of forest, area enclosure and type of land upon which the forest was to be situated - the results point to significant differences in preferences across the study population, suggesting that programs should be tailored to the communities in which the program is to be implemented.

Applying time-series analytical mechanisms to fuel, biofuel and agricultural commodity prices and production, we estimate the long-rung relationship between energy prices, bioenergy production and the global land use change. Our results suggest that rising energy prices and bioenergy production signicantly contribute to the global land use change both through the direct and indirect land use change impact. Globally, the total agricultural area yearly increases by 35578.1 thousand ha due to increasing oil price, and by 12125.1 thousand ha due to increasing biofuel production, which corresponds to 0.73% and 0.25% of the total world-wide agricultural area, respectively.

This study utilizes household and parcel level data from rural Kenya to explore the linkage between land access and food security. We find that a 10% increase in operated land size would increase household total food consumption per capita, cereal consumption per capita, non-cereal consumption, and home produced food consumption by 2.6%, 2.1%, 2.7% and 5.4%, respectively. We also find that land rental is the dominant mechanism that poor rural farmers use to access additional land for cultivation. However, the levels of long-term land investment and land productivity are significantly lower for rented parcels than for own parcels even after household fixed-effect and parcel level observed characteristics are controlled for. Furthermore, land rental markets do not allow farmers to fully adjust their operated land size to their desired level.";"Rie Muraoka

"OSF_preprint:460B4-B19-D16";"The Land Governance Assessment Framework: Identifying and Monitoring Good Practice in the Land Sector";"";"Increased global demand for land posits the need for well-designed country-level land policies to protect long-held rights, facilitate land access and address any constraints that land policy may pose for broader growth. While the implementation of land reforms can be a lengthy process, the need to swiftly identify key land policy challenges and devise responses that allow the monitoring of progress, in a way that minimizes conflicts and supports broader development goals, is clear. The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) makes a substantive contribution to the land sector by providing a quick and innovative tool to monitor land governance at the country level. The LGAF offers a comprehensive diagnostic tool that covers five main areas for policy intervention: Legal and institutional framework; Land use planning, management and taxation; Management of public land; Public provision of land information; and Dispute resolution and conflict management. The LGAF assesses these areas through a set of detailed indicators that are rated on a scale of pre-coded statements (from lack of good governance to good practice). While land governance can be highly technical in nature and tends to be addressed in a partial and sporadic manner, the LGAF posits a tool for a comprehensive assessment, taking into account the broad range of issues that land governance encompasses, while enabling those unfamiliar with land to grasp its full complexity. The LGAF will make it possible for policymakers to make sense of the technical levels of the land sector, benchmark governance, identify areas that require further attention and monitor progress. It is intended to assist countries in prioritizing reforms in the land sector by providing a holistic diagnostic review that can inform policy dialogue in a clear and targeted manner. In addition to presenting the LGAF tool, this book includes detailed case studies on its implementation in five selected countries: Peru, the Kyrgyz Republic, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Tanzania.

If the evaluation suggests that rural Albanians retain the set of family-oriented norms and beliefs that are based primarily on patriarchalism and patrilineal inheritance, we must address the following questions: How appropriate is the mixture of western law that emulates individualistic notions of property rights with the customary family-tenure system of rural Albania? What are the likely problems that could emerge during the transition given a potential conflict between family notions of ownership and individual notions of ownership? This paper discusses five broad issues: the contemporary importance of family ownership, the role of the patriarch, the contemporary inheritance procedures, the vulnerability of specific groups of women, and the structure of the Albanian family.

The leguminous tree pongamia (Pongamia pinnata syn. Milettia pinnata) could be utilized to produce biofuel while restoring degraded land. Here, we explore the potential of pongamia as a source of biofuel and for restoring degraded land in Indonesia. Pongamia occurs across Indonesia, in Sumatra, Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and Maluku. It grows to a height of 15–20 m and can grow in a range of environmental conditions. Its seeds can generate up to 40% crude oil by weight. It can help to restore degraded land and improve soil properties. Pongamia also provides wood, fodder, medicine, fertilizer and biogas. Therefore, as a multipurpose species, pongamia holds great potential to combat Indonesia’s energy crisis and to restore much of the degraded land.";"Jaya Wohono

We hypothesize that farms compete on local land markets and interact through knowledge transfer leading to positive and negative feedbacks, respectively. One of the main challenges in the analysis of farm level interaction is to distinguish between actual interactions from the effects of spatially correlated omitted variables. We approach this challenge be estimating a spatially lagged explanatory model (SLX) employing two spatial weighting matrix differentiating between a local and regional neighbourhood. Using a spatially explicit dataset for nearly all Norwegian farms in 1999 and 2009, we found that neighbouring effects differ substantially between local and regional neighbourhood. Our results indicate that the behaviour of directly neighbouring farms is indeed important for farm growth decisions.";"Thomas Heckelei

The point of departure of my argument is the Ili- Wawas Integrated Project, a combined logging and agricultural project which seeks to bring economic development to the remote Pomio district of East New Britain Province by connecting existing logging roads to the limited national road network around the provincial capital. Developing the national road network and creating standardized or—to use James Scott’s concept—legible environments can be seen as an integral part of state-making and strengthening the role of the state. In addition to the environment, the state also needs to make social life legible in forms of maps, censuses and laws. As I will argue in my paper, the Ili-Wawas, and other similar projects, may indeed strengthen the role of the state not only by creating the infrastructure and legibility needed by the state, but also in unintended and accidental ways. The side effects of logging and road building include, among others, fear of crime and land disputes.

It promotes the legal recognition of existing landholders’ rights (through certification) and the decentralization of land management. Despite the change of paradigm underlying this new wave of reforms, premises and expectations remain unchanged: a) rights legalization is justified by large tenure insecurity and b) rights formalization is a prerequisite to reduce conflicts over land rights, improve access to credit, boost productive investments and stimulate land markets. But before analyzing economic impacts, the relations between land reform and tenure security need to be explored. In this line, the paper first explores the determinant of the sense of tenure insecurity and underlines the complementary role of certification to informal and existing modes of rights validation (petits papiers). It shows then that decentralization of land management (through the creation of local land offices) offers a better and a more equitable access to legal information, land administration institutions, legalization of rights and devices of conflict resolution. But it also underlines that this ongoing process of legal empowerment still need to be more inclusive for the poor and discusses the ways to reinforce this process without denying the reality of local/customary land practices. certification, land reform, legal empowerment, tenure security, madagascar, marché foncier, certificationmadagascarréforme agraire, droit de propriété, ménage agricole";"Perrine Burnod

"OSF_preprint:46164-FD3-265";"Women's land rights in the transition to individualized ownership";"";"This study explores the impact of changes in land tenure institutions on women's land rights and the efficiency of tree resource management in Western Ghana. We find that customary land tenure institutions have evolved toward individualized systems to provide incentives to invest in tree planting. However, contrary to the common belief that individualization of land tenure weakens women's land rights, these have been strengthened through inter vivos gifts and the practice of the Intestate Succession Law. Investment in tree planting, in turn, is affected not simply by the level of land tenure security, but also by its expected changes, as tree planting strengthens land tenure security. Cocoa yields are lower on allocated family land and rented land under share tenancy due to distorted work incentives. While men and women are equally likely to plant trees, women obtain lower yields on their cocoa plots, suggesting the presence of gender-specific constraints.

In this paper a simple dynamic optimisation model is developed and applied to find land-use strategies that maximise benefits from the viewpoints of both individual farmers and the catchment as a whole. Privately optimal land-use may result in an ever-increasing trend in salinity and a declining trend in productivity for the discharge zone of the catchment. Considerable welfare losses may occur under private management when the recharge and the discharge zones are owned by different individuals. These welfare losses are estimated by comparing the value of the stream of benefits obtained by the catchment under private management with those obtained when management is under a common property regime. Difficulties in establishing such a system are discussed, in particular the problem of establishing enforceable common property rights over the groundwater table.";"Mujib Ullah

"OSF_preprint:4607F-5FD-306";"Welfare Economic Aspects of Land Use Planning";"";"This paper develops a unifying framework for spatial and environmental economics, based on equilibrium considerations for population games. The main contribution of this paper consists of introducing a consistent concept for spatial welfare. Following the introduction of estimable locational sorting models for valuation methods in environmental economics, the relationship between the theoretical underpinnings of the hedonic pricing model and the bid rent concept in urban economics is re-examined. This is done along the definition of the ideal general equilibrium willingness to pay (GE-WTP) that is at the heart of most applications of locational sorting models in environmental economics. A GE-WTP should be able to account for the value of non-marginal changes in a spatially explicit distribution of local public goods. Commonly, such a GE-WTP is derived as a Hicksian WTP adjusted for endogenous prices. Endogenous prices are typically enforced by a market clearing condition, often a fixed supply, constraining the relocation of a population in response to the changes in local quality. This paper offers an alternative interpretation of a GE-WTP. It demonstrates how for a discrete choice formulation, a fixed supply generically results in a Nash equilibrium in a population game. Furthermore, it is shown that this Nash equilibrium corresponds exactly to a spatial equilibrium in urban economics. This observation allows for a novel spatially explicit approach to the evaluation of land policy options, combining current cost-benefit practice with the optimization of land use. Finally it is shown, how the GE-WTP can be adjusted for developers' decisions, based on the analogy with urban economic models. It allows this spatial welfare measure to be extended with endogenous, instead of fixed, supply. This makes the concept also suitable for comparing the social welfare implications of entirely different land use patterns.";"Anne Van Der Veen

Our findings suggest that (1) the purchase of protected areas achieves economies of scale in size on average; (2) the fee simple deals achieve economies of scale in size while the easements do not, and the easement deals are more cost effective than the fee simple deals; (3) targeting the protection of mammals or birds achieves greater economies of scale than not targeting them; and (4) the deals without development pressures achieve greater economies of scale in size than the deals with the threat of development.

Most conceptual approaches investigate the effects of land registration on only one sector, nut land registration is commonly observed to affect not only other sectors but the economy as a whole. The author builds on the well-tested link between secure land ownership and farm productivity, adding to the framework theory about positive information and transaction costs. To map the relationship between land registration and financial development and economic growth, the framework links: 1) Land tenure security and investment incentives. 2) Land title, collateral, and credit. 3) Land markets, transactions, and efficiency. 4) Labor mobility and efficiency. 5) Land liquidity, deposit mobilization, and investment. Empirical results from applying the framework to a single case study - of Thailand, described in a separate paper - suggest that the framework is sound.

Patterns of gradual, endogenous change toward formalization are being challenged by rapid and large-scale demands from outsiders. Little attention has focused on the gender dimensions of this transformation. Based on a study of land tenure in Uganda, this paper analyzes how different ways of defining landownership—based on household reports, existence of ownership documents, and rights over the land—provide very different indications of the gendered patterns of landownership and rights. Although many households report that husbands and wives jointly own the land, women are less likely to be listed on ownership documents, especially titles, and women have fewer land rights. A simplistic focus on title to land misses much of the reality regarding land tenure and could especially have an adverse impact on women's land rights.

This study examines forestry funds in 100 communities in three districts to assess how large they are and how they are utilized. The study finds that the income from community funds increases local development resources by about 25%. This income is invested in schools, temples, roads, and water reservoirs, which bodes well for rural development. However, there are some critical problems with the 'pro-poor programme', an effort to reduce poverty through the resources generated from community forestry. The study finds that timber is subsidized and the subsidies accrue mainly to the non-poor. Furthermore, income spent on loans tends to favor the non-poor. Overall some 74% of the benefits of community forestry funds accrue to the non-poor while 26% accrue to the poor in rural communities in Nepal. The study concludes that two actions may increase the benefits accruing to the poor: a) allowing all households to have an equal share in timber that is harvested; and b) increasing the participation of poor and less advantaged members in the executive committees that manage forestry funds.

"OSF_preprint:46110-FD1-BB0";"Cost- benefit analysis of the location of new forest land";"";"In this paper we show how cost-benefit analysis can be used as a decision support mechanism for the location of new (urban) forest land, starting from the multifunctional role of these new forests. We start with a simple presentation of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) technique. Key features of this evaluation technique are that (i) all - both positive and negative - impacts for all relevant parties (i.e. not only the project promoter) are taken into account and (ii) evaluation occurs on the basis of monetary values. Next, we give an overview of all relevant costs and benefits of afforestation projects for the whole society. On the cost side, we distinguish costs directly related to the afforestation project itself, such as tree planting and forest management on the one hand and opportunity costs on the other hand. On the benefit side we make a distinction between use and non-use values. Use values include timber production, hunting, recreation and ecosystem values. Non-use and option values capture forest benefits that are independent from the actual use made of the forest area. As valuation of recreation and non-use/option values is not straightforward, we discuss their valuation methods in more detail. For valuing recreation the travel cost method (TCM) is the most widely used technique. TCM seeks how the visit frequency responds to changes in the price of a visit. Non-use values can only be valued using the contingent valuation method (CVM). CVM uses survey questions to elicit people's preferences for public goods by finding out what they would be willing to pay for specified changes in them. Finally, we apply the CBA to a real life policy problem. The Flemish government has agreed on a 10.000 ha forest expansion in Flanders, focusing on the multifunction role of forests. In our case study we give an example for the Ghent region (East Flanders). We investigate the net benefits per hectare of combinations of potential forests that meet the surface restriction of 540 ha. We show the importance of including recreation benefits in the evaluation of afforestation projects and more specifically the role of alternative forests (substitutes) in the valuation of one specific forest. We find that this substitution effect is significant in the decision on the location of new forests and leads to a wide variation in the net benefits per hectare of different combinations.

PPAs provide multiple ecological, social and economic benefits to diverse range of stakeholders in across a range of contexts. These include supporting the desire of landowners to protect conservation values on their land, contributing to national conservation targets, and reducing financial costs of land management to governments. In addition, they provide opportunities to engage landowners to strengthen community social and conservation values through positive partnerships with governments, NGOs, and other groups. This policy brief explores the key drivers of landowner participation in PPA programs (i.e.covenants, easements, servitudes and other long-term agreements with individuals or groups of landowners) and the program mechanisms that maintain successive generations of landowners to be engaged and committed to long-term stewardship. It also considers the challenges faced by PPA programs in developing and maintaining strong collaborative arrangements between the stakeholders involved in these programs.";"Andrew Knight

"OSF_preprint:46130-957-A6B";"Pathways of development in the hillsides of Honduras";"";"Based on a survey of 48 communities in central Honduras, this paper identifies the major pathways of development that have been occurring in central Honduras since the mid-1970s, their causes and implications for agricultural productivity, natural resource sustainability, and poverty. Six pathways of development were identified: 1) basic grains expansion communities—where basic grains production is the dominant activity and increased basic grains production has occurred; 2) basic grains stagnation communities—where basic grains production is dominant but has stagnated or declined; 3) coffee expansion communities—where coffee production is important and has been increasing in importance; 4) horticultural expansion communities—where substantial adoption and expansion of horticultural crops has occurred; 5) forestry specialization communities—where forestry activities are important and basic grains production is stagnant or declining; and 6) nonfarm employment communities—where nonfarm employment is a major and increasing source of income. The pathways were distinguished by factors determining comparative advantage, including agricultural potential, population density, and access to markets and technology. Changes in agriculture and resource management differ significantly among these pathways, though poverty was found to decline to a similar extent across all pathways. It appears that the key causes of change in productivity and resource management are different and more pathway-dependent than the key causes of change in poverty, which depends to a great extent on provision of public services. Basic infrastructure and public services are badly needed throughout most of central Honduras, while efforts to address sustainable agricultural development may not be sufficient to solve poverty problems. There may not be large tradeoffs between achieving more sustainable development and reducing poverty, since the causes are different. The findings also imply that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to technical assistance is unlikely to be successful, since different approaches show promise in different pathways.";"John L. Pender

In addition, a federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandates an increase in cellulosic ethanol production over the next decade. This paper quantifies the effects on local biomass supply and demand of different co-firing policies imposed on 398 existing coal-fired power plants. Our model indicates which counties are most likely to be able to sustain cellulosic ethanol plants in addition to co-firing electric utilities. The simulation incorporates the county-level biomass market of corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, and forest residues as well as endogenous crop prices. Our scenarios indicate that there is sufficient feedstock availability in Southern Minnesota, Iowa, and Central Illinois. Significant supply shortages are observed in Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, and the tri-state area of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky which are characterized by a high density of coal-fired power plants with high energy output.";"Jerome Dumortier";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2015-01-01";"en";"land use";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"USA";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46243-148-76C";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

Development in Chile";"";"Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is an oilseed with potential for use as a raw material in second-generation biofuels. Camelina has a seed yield of up to 2380 kg ha-1 and contains around 45% fatty acids. Selection of a suitable site is critical for production optimization. The objective of this study was to determine Chilean agro-climatic suitability for establishing camelina as a productive alternative. Climate and soil requirements and geographical restraints were evaluated for the species, considering the climatological characteristics of its regions of origin, as well as regions where camelina is successfully grown in the rest of the world. The variables considered include factors (maximum temperatures of the warmest month, water deficits, and degree days) and limitations (altitude, geomorphology, and current land use), which permitted the evaluation of the national territory for a certain level of suitability. It was determined that 1.3% of the national territory (960,664 ha) has some degree of suitability for camelina adoption. Between the Biobío and Los Lagos regions, 49.0% of land (471,203 ha) is in the category of without thermic restrictions, with mild water restrictions, and mild soil restrictions or without information, which can be used for camelina production. The Los Ríos region had 21.4% surface area (321,176 ha) with some level of suitability for camelina, the most suitable region to establish this crop in Chile.";"Juan Manueluribe

By estimating the change in ecosystem service value before and after the implementation of land consolidation planning, it is able to quantitatively describe the change in ecosystem service value arising from land consolidation planning, so as to provide a quantitative basis for the environmental impact assessment of land consolidation. Taking the case of Anhui Province, the authors developed the equivalency factor table of ecosystem service value, to determine the economic value of single equivalency factor of ecological service value in the study area, calculate per unit area of ecological service value of land ecosystem in the study area, and research the change in ecosystem service value before and after the implementation of land consolidation planning in Anhui Province. The results show that after the implementation of a new round of land consolidation planning in Anhui Province, the total ecosystem service value may decrease to some extent, the farmland ecosystem service value substantially increases, while water body ecosystem service value greatly decreases.";"Shaojia Cao

The paper attempts to explore the Mozambican community land delimitation (CLD) program based on a community-level survey conducted in mid-September 2014. The survey revealed that land conflict is the main reason to initiate a CLD process, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are major players in initiating and helping the CLD process. Two-thirds of the CLD communities have completed all the necessary phases of the CLD process and received community land use certificates (Direito do Uso e Apreveitamento da Terra (DUAT). The major reason for not completing CLD processes is the withdrawal of the NGOs helping the process. More than 90 percent of the CLD communities mentioned improvement in land-related disputes both with other communities and within communities after the CLD process. Generally, not many significant differences are observed between the CLD and non-CLD communities. Land-related disputes are identified as the first most common dispute in 50 percent of the communities surveyed, with a difference between CLD (63 percent) and non-CLD (31 percent) communities. Similarly, land disputes are not only the first most common but also the first most difficult disputes in the surveyed communities. Among the surveyed communities were large-scale land acquisitions by domestic (35 percent) and foreign (10 percent) investors, with limited community involvement. The study found that CLD seems to have a strong demand from the non-CLD communities, as more than 50 percent of the non-CLD communities have a household-level willingness to pay for CLD process either in cash or in kind. land rights, land tenure, land use, land conflicts, surveys, community land delimitation (CLD), Willingness to pay, Direito do Uso e Apreveitamento da Terra (DUAT),";"Sileshi Woldeyohannes

"OSF_preprint:461D7-D9E-594";"Land rights insecurity and temporary migration in rural China";"";"Like most other developing countries, China experiences huge migration outflows from rural areas. Their most striking characteristic is a high geographical and temporal mobility. Rural migrants keep going back and forth between origin villages and destination areas. In this paper, we show that this temporary feature of migration can be linked to land rights insecurity. As village land ownership remains collective and as land use rights can be periodically reallocated, individual out-migration can result in deprivation of those rights. Moreover, the intensity of this insecurity varies according to the village-level management of land and the contractual status of land plots. We use these variations to identify the effect of land rights insecurity on migration behavior. Empirical results based on representative 2002 rural data demonstrate substantial impact. Comme dans la plupart des pays en voie de développement, les flux d'émigration rurale ont pris une ampleur considérable en Chine. Une de leurs caractéristiques les plus remarquables est leur importante versatilité, géographique aussi bien que temporelle. Les migrants ruraux vont et viennent entre village d'origine et régions de destination. Dans cet article, nous montrons que ce caractère temporaire des migrations peut être relié à l'insécurité des droits fonciers. La propriété foncière étant collective, et les droits d'usage concédés aux paysans pouvant être réalloués périodiquement, migrer peut mettre ces droits en danger. En outre, le degré de cette insécurité varie selon les politiques foncières locales et selon le statut contractuel des parcelles exploitées par les ménages. Nous utilisons ces variations pour identifier l'effet de l'insécurité des droits fonciers sur les comportements de migration. A partir d'une large enquête rurale de 2002, nos résultats empiriques démontrent qu'elle a un impact substantiel.";"Deng Quheng

These policies may or may not yield the expected dividend. The trouble is, because the dividend yields of policies are not readily obvious, it is critical for them to be carefully gauged and regularly monitored. For the developing world, owing particularly to the generally high levels of noises in the available data, there are often fundamental difficulties in appraising the actual magnitude of dividends associated with particular property related policies. And very little studies are occurring in this area. Factorial designed statistical technique is employed in this study to analyse empirical data gathered in Ghana with the view to gauging the benefits that existing land policies in that country are respectively yielding. What emerges from this study is that, all the different strands of land policies in Ghana are producing positive benefits. The magnitude and significance of these benefits however vary with the policy type. Government compulsory purchase and compensation policies that have been used to acquire lands and distributed to private developers were found to be the most beneficial. The relatively high infrastructural investments and professional management in the areas so affected by this particular genre of land policy possibly account for this considerable benefits they are yielding. Land titling laws and regulations, in contrast, were found, rather surprisingly, to be offering insignificant benefits. Also, interactions among the various types of policies were unexpectedly found to be offering no real benefits at all with the effect that formalising land rights under more than one land policy type leads necessarily to extra costs without associated extra benefits. These results draw attention to the need to rethink the existing land titling arrangements in particular and governmentÃ­s infrastructure investments in general with the view to introducing a more beneficial alternative for the formalisation of land rights as well as balanced platform for all policies to contribute their optimal.";"Adarkwah Antwi

The conflicting impacts found are partly as a result of different model specifications, the type of data used – panel or cross sectional data – and possibly due to imperfections in rural markets. We control for these problems using household and plot level panel data from rural farmers in Uganda. We find that ownership of cattle has a negative and significant impact on land productivity. Investment in farm related assets, land improvements and other small livestock, however, significantly increases productivity. The conflicting impacts are a result of measurement error. The plot size inverse productivity is robust to different specifications and is largely explained by plot-specific unobserved heterogeneity and imperfections in rural markets.

Mediation activities vary with case type, complexity, significance and conflict level. Mediation activities reduce conflicts even in those cases where final decisions are made through verdicts. Cases that have a mediated settlement are generally less complex, less significant and have lower conflict levels than cases ending with verdicts. Judges use a large number of mediation techniques, and there are large variations in mediation styles between judges.

For that purpose, we resort to the World Bank LSMS-ISA database established in 2014 from a representative sample at the national level of 10,800 farming households in Burkina Faso. The empirical application favors the estimation of a multivariate Probit with random effects and of a translog model with household fixed effects. The results show that households which have got an individual land management on the one hand, and mixed management on the other have on average a greater tenure security effect on the performance of agricultural activities than the peasants who manage their land collectively.

Hence, in light of the instrumental role played by caloric yield in sustaining and supporting population growth, and given importance of pre-industrial population density for the subsequent course of economic development, the Caloric Suitability Index dominates the conventional measure in capturing the effect of land productivity on pre-colonial population density and the subsequent course of economic development.

"OSF_preprint:461E7-02E-3E5";"Land governance of suburban areas of Vietnam";"";"After the Doi Moi (‘renovation’) reforms in Vietnam from 1986, land ownership rules were adjusted, effectively terminating former land collectivisation efforts. While land ownership remained fully under the control of the state, a 1993 land law conferred 20-year leaseholds to most farmers. They could now utilize farm land individually, and sell, swap and mortgage the land in a situation similar to private ownership. These leaseholds are now expiring and a new 2013 land law is in the making. This paper was initially written for UNDP Vietnam which supports Vietnam to help formulate a strong new land law, and brings out the complexities of land governance in the suburban areas of fast expanding Vietnamese cities. It first considers the present and changing land use of suburban areas and the key stakeholders involved here – powerful State Owned Enterprises, farmers, bureaucrats and communist party leaders. Planning practices are then assessed – and seen to be both rigid and complex, with different departments at various levels working at cross purposes under conditions of conflicting rules, laws and weak capacities. This is one reason for the dominance of informal arrangements and widespread corruption, where powerful actors benefit hugely and illegally from conditions of opacity and informal networks. Overall outcomes are that cities expand in a haphazard (‘leapfrog’) and inefficient manner, with insufficient attention for timely and adequate infrastructure, the environment and for people’s welfare as in social amenities and parks. As a result of lopsided incentive systems, it is the state which foregoes huge incomes and faces more costly investments, while many suburban farmers are affected through (arbitrary) land acquisition and inadequate compensation.

"OSF_preprint:46180-4CD-4A9";"Rural development in Botswana: Experience from elsewhere and emerging issues";"";"Poverty incidence is one of the most critical concerns in Botswana and the government has resolved to eradicate this problem and ensure that every citizen live in a dignified and acceptable condition consistent with the national aspirations as set out in the National Vision 2016. Currently, rural areas are persistently experiencing the highest poverty incidence compared to any other place in the country. This has been the case ever since we have measured the extent of the poverty problem in 1985/86. Rural development in Botswana has been a central policy and strategy of government effort to improve the welfare and standard of living since independence. Since the 1970s, a rural development council that was traditionally chaired by a Vice President demonstrates the importance that government takes about rural development. The membership of this council involves all permanent secretaries and key non-government stakeholders. The Council has made tremendous success in transforming Botswana from a primarily rural based population to a country where the majority of its residents live in urban areas. Initial rural development efforts that provided basic infrastructure countrywide contributed to Botswana’s urbanization as part of this process involved a reclassification of many former rural villages into urban villages, particularly after the 1991 Population Census. Rural population is now a minority but the problems of poverty and vulnerability remains higher than in other areas. The nature and outlook of rural areas have changed dramatically and so have the needs of the rural people. There is a need to review our definition of a rural area, and re-visit the policies and processes of facilitating rural development to make them more relevant to emerging issues and challenges. This papers proposes that the country should choose its programmes and projects for development based on their ability and past record to perform, target government support more efficiently and effectively, acknowledge emerging challenges and respond accordingly by improving the operations of a market system, even if it requires government intervention.";"Pelotshweu Moepeng";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2013-06-01";"en";"agriculture;poverty;property rights;rural development";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"BWA";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-4CD-4A9";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

Both systems of law reflect distinctively different economic structures. That oversight laid the foundations for the conflicts between the customary law and practice and the Anglo-American common law, its notions and conceptions of tenure. The conflict that developed has become one of the most formidable obstacles to socioeconomic development in Ghana since colonial times. One of the objectives of this work is to shed light on the linkages between the exploitative capitalist sector and the traditional communal system. In the process, we hope to show that service by the traditional system of the capitalist sector of the economy lies at the root of economic underdevelopment in Ghana. If we achieve our objectives, then we should be able to demonstrate that legislative measures aimed at establishing a machinery for land registration can neither solve the problems of underdevelopment nor effectively eliminate the manifestations of conflict in the shape of litigation and economic underdevelopment. Instead, it would in its effect consolidate the usurpation and privatization of communal lands to be concentrated in the hands of a minority of the rich, speed up the pace of landlessness and social stratification, and lead to political instability. We seek to demonstrate that the present privatization policies, planned within the framework of the International Monetary Fund's and the World Bank's globalization schemes, would aggravate these problems and sharpen the contradictions.

"OSF_preprint:46015-D80-87C";"Land Titling and Investment In Tanzania: An Empirical Investigation";"";"The role of property rights in resource allocation has been one of the central themes in development economics. There exists extensive theoretical arguments that property rights in land are closely associated with the productive efficiency of agricultural resources as well as investment decisions. However, empirical findings have not been conclusive. This has been complicated due to possible endogeneity of titles, unobserved hetrogeneities and the non-experimental nature of the data. To overcome these problems, the study employs an instrumental variable and fixed effect models. The inheritance status of a plot is used as an IV for the titling status of a plot. Using the 2010/2011 Tanzania National Survey data, it is shown that the effects of titling on investment is positive and sizable. Formal tests of endogeneity are presented to establish the claim that titles are endogenous.

"OSF_preprint:460CE-49B-F5F";"Land-Use Change and Carbon Sinks";"";"When and if the United States chooses to implement a greenhouse gas reduction program, it will be necessary to decide whether carbon sequestration policies — such as those that promote forestation and discourage deforestation — should be part of the domestic portfolio of compliance activities. We investigate the cost of forest-based carbon sequestration. In contrast with previous approaches, we econometrically examine micro-data on revealed landowner preferences, modeling six major private land uses in a comprehensive analysis of the contiguous United States. The econometric estimates are used to simulate landowner responses to sequestration policies. Key commodity prices are treated as endogenous and a carbon sink model is used to predict changes in carbon storage. Our estimated marginal costs of carbon sequestration are greater than those from previous engineering cost analyses and sectoral optimization models. Our estimated sequestration supply function is similar to the carbon abatement supply function from energy-based analyses, suggesting that forest-based carbon sequestration merits inclusion in a cost-effective portfolio of domestic U.S. climate change strategies. abatement; carbon; climate change; costs; forestry; greenhouse gases; land use; landuse change; sequestration";"Andrew Plantinga

"OSF_preprint:460BD-55B-C07";"Are free land arrangement really free? An exploration into land arrangements made by rural-urban migrants in the Northeast of Thailand";"";"This paper contributes to an emerging literature on free land arrangements in developing countries. We argue that in-depth empirical analysis is crucial to understand the specific terms of land arrangements. Using mixed quantitative and qualitative data collected among rural-urban migrants in Thailand, we categorize land arrangements along four dimensions: self-reported categories by the actors, the nature of the relationship between the parties involved, the nature of the payment made, and how explicit or binding are the contractual terms. The economic motivations in each of the consequent categories of land arrangement are then analyzed with simple econometrics. Our main results suggest that while free land arrangements are allegedly common practice in Thailand, only a small number of these free arrangements are really free. Many appear to be a `disguised form of rental contract', similar to sharecropping except for the fact that they are reported as free arrangements. Disguised rental is often found among households who rely heavily on the safety net function of land. Or results also suggest that the arrangements which do not involve any direct repayment or compensation are often parts of complex inter-vivo bequests, and involve incomplete transfers of property rights.";"Gwendoline Promsopha";"";"HAL CCSD";"Center for Open Science";"2018-01-18";"en";"land markets;land titling;migration;property rights";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Investments;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"THA";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BD-55B-C07";"http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01565843/file/AreFreeArrang_Version2017_1.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""

"OSF_preprint:4601E-5BF-C03";"A Land Tenure Module for LSMS";"";"This paper proposes to fill the important gap in reliable and nationally representative land tenure data by including a Land Tenure Module (LTM) to be linked to multi-purpose household surveys such as the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS). Developing survey standards to generate globally comparable land data is important for generating data to be used in global and regional land governance monitoring initiatives (SDGs; LPI – UNECA; GLTN/ GLII; VGGT). The LTM can be a cost-effective way to provide data for evidence-based analyses that will help identify the areas where policy action can have the most significant and/or immediate impact, and help in sequencing and prioritizing policy interventions. The paper illustrates important issues that may be analyzed based on such a module in order to motivate its implementation and where the current state of knowledge is constrained by limited data access. To facilitate this integration, a generic LTM is proposed based on an assessment of existing tenure modules and lessons learned from surveys on land tenure. It introduces a basic structure including: (i) ownership and use of agricultural and non-agricultural land and immobile assets on the land, (ii) sources of land acquisition including inheritance, (iii) land transactions, (iv) formal and informal property rights, (v) investments on the land, (vi) land conflicts, (vii) legal knowledge, (viii) gender and property rights, (ix) perceptions of tenure security and (x) trust in land-related institutions.

Irish agriculture is characterised by a lack of land mobility despite a number of policy initiatives designed to address to problem, most notably tax exemptions on income derived from the long-term leasing of land. Using socio-economic data from the Teagasc National Farm Survey, a number of hypothetical farms are created using a microsimulation approach to compare incomes across farm systems and land use options. Tax and subsidy policies are applied to derive rates of return for the hypothetical farms under a variety of land use scenarios. The analysis finds that in numerous hypothetical scenarios, leasing out agricultural land on a long-term basis can prove more profitable for cattle and tillage farmers than farming the land. Only dairy farmers derive consistently higher disposable incomes from farming their land as opposed to leasing it out. However, despite these results, 66% of Irish agricultural land is used for cattle and tillage farming. Further work is required to determine the reasons why many Irish farmers prefer to farm land unprofitably rather than lease the land out at a profit.";"Cathal Geoghegan

To address that gap, the present research develops a consistent framework for analyzing local level production where community organizations have vertically integrated into the wood products industry, using common property forest as a source of raw material. Based on an incomplete contracting approach, it is argued that vertical integration allows local stakeholders to guide development within their community, provided that marginal productivity attains a certain level. Empirical results using a survey of 44 community governance regimes in Oaxaca, Mexico, show that communities are more likely to integrate forward into timber processing activities when they achieve initial levels of human and and social capital and increase labor productivity through higher forest land endowments. The model is extended to demonstrate that economies of scope arise between community-level timber production and non-timber benefits. community development, forestry, human capital, labor productivity, property rights, risk, vertical integration, Social and Behavioral Sciences";"Camille M.

Driven in part by political events in countries like Zimbabwe, the literature has sought to understand the economic implications of land reform. Much of this literature focuses on credit market imperfections and the role of land as collateral. Redistribution of land allows poor farmers to borrow, invest, and thus escape poverty. But in terms of aggregate production, redistributing land may have positive, negative, or neutral effects on output. This paper will use a calibrated, dynamic, span-of-control model to investigate the impact of redistributing land.

"OSF_preprint:46177-405-2E6";"Land reform in Zimbabwe";"";"There is widespread agreement on the need for land reform in Zimbabwe as a means of reducing poverty. This paper assesses the potential consequences of a land-reform scheme that draws on proposals from Zimbabwe's government in 1998 and 1999. The authors analyze the impact of the reform on resettled farm households and as a development project for which they conduct cost-benefit analysis. The analysis, which considers costs and benefits during a 15-year period, relies on a set of models of family farms that are typical of those that would benefit from land redistribution. The cost-benefit analysis is more comprehensive, also considering the different costs and benefits that affect the government. The results of the analysis indicate that a government-supported land reform could be economically viable under what the authors consider as realistic assumptions regarding the performance of the beneficiaries and the costs that will be faced by the government and other stakeholders. Land reform can generate sustainable livelihoods for the beneficiaries. If viewed as a project, the NPV of the reform is positive for a discount rate that is as high as 20%. The project can also increase employment in the agricultural sector. The analysis takes a long-run perspective, covering a 15-year period. During the first resettlement years, some disruption of agricultural production should be expected. These results are preliminary and based on a partial equilibrium perspective. They are driven by the assumption that the land reform is carried out in a manner that allows farmers on the resettled lands to achieve their productive potential. Such an outcome depends critically on the assumption that the farmers are able to operate in an enabling environment, including critical government support, especially during years 1-5.

Yet the inevitable by-product, i.e. livestock faecal matter, represents a potential source of pathogenic microorganisms. This paper applies the Faecal Indicator Organisms Costing Assessment Tool (FIOCAT), which was designed as part of the RELU project ‘sustainable and holistic food chains for recycling livestock waste to land’, to examine the costs associated with mitigation methods that may inhibit pathogenic transfers to water. FIO-CAT is comprised of three interrelated models: the economic dairy management (EDM) model, the farm business survey (FBS) model and the manure, infrastructure and environment (MIE) model. Specifically, it models dairy, and cattle and sheep farms in the River Taw catchment in South West England and determines the economic impact that mitigation methods have on farm businesses. However, the inherent complexity associated with heterogeneous landscapes confounds the likelihood that a single management strategy will provide complete protection of receiving waters from microbial contamination.";"Dave Chadwick

We use a quasi-experimental technique by combining the inverse probability weighting estimator proposed by Hirano and Imbens (2001) with an interval regression model to shed light on what might be seen as the effect of title ownership on housing values in Brazilian favelas once selection on observed characteristics are controlled for. We also use state fixed effects to control for idiosyncratic characteristics of states. We interpret the resulting estimate in the same vein as Friedman et al (1988) as an estimate of the willingness to pay for tenure security. As far as we know, this is the first attempt at estimating willingness to pay for tenure security in Brazilian favelas. Our results suggest that people living in favelas are willing to pay on average an additional 18% of the value of their house for tenure security. However we find that among the poor willingness to pay for tenure security is substantially less, and for some disappears entirely. We suggest that this may be either because households in smaller and longer established favelas may have developed informal mechanisms to ensure their security or because the poor are skeptical about the real security the title represents in that environment. We argue that these estimates are useful for public policy in Brazil, where millions of households live in informal dwellings and interventions involving land regularization do not appear to account for households’ willingness to pay. We also simulate the likely cost of a titling programme and the consequences for household debt burdens. urban housing; housing demand; tenure security; informal settlements; slums; poverty; welfare";"Caio Piza

First, it takes stock of what we know so far about the determinants of land grab. Second, it presents a picture of sustainable and equitable development of the foreign land acquisitions. Third, policy syndromes are examined and policy implications discussed.

"OSF_preprint:46172-D86-697";"The Price of Empowerment: Experimental Evidence on Land Titling in Tanzania";"";"We report on a randomized field experiment using price incentives to address both economic and gender inequality in land tenure formalization. During the 1990s and 2000s, nearly two dozen African countries proposed de jure land reforms extending access to formal, freehold land tenure to millions of poor households. Many of these reforms stalled. Titled land remains the de facto preserve of wealthy households and, within households, men. Beginning in 2010, we tested whether price instruments alone can generate greater inclusion by offering formal titles to residents of a low-income, unplanned settlement in Dar es Salaam at a range of subsidized prices, as well as additional price incentives to include women as owners or co-owners of household land. Estimated price elasticities of demand confirm that prices – rather than other implementation failures or features of the titling regime – are a key obstacle to broader inclusion in the land registry, and that some degree of pro-poor price discrimination is justified even from a narrow budgetary perspective. In terms of gender inequality, we find that even small price incentives for female co-titling achieve almost complete gender parity in land ownership with no reduction in demand. land titling; formalization; gender; field experiment; Tanzania";"Stefan Dercon

The usages of agricultural land are also gradually decreasing. Even within the total agricultural area, most of the land has been used for industrial crops, and the ratio between industrial crops and food crops is increasing. Paddy is the main food crop in Malaysia, but as a low rate of productivity, farmers are engaged on part time basis. Therefore, it seems necessary to know the socioeconomic characteristics of the paddy farmers, their livelihood, and agricultural sustainability for policy implementation and its evaluation. This study analyzes the current profile of the paddy farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA), NorthWest Selangor, Malaysia based on primary data. The data was collected through a questionnaire survey. Findings of the study suggest policy recommendations and action plans for the improvement of the farmers’ livelihood. The findings of the study are important for the policy makers and relevant agencies.";"Chamhuri Siwar

The report 2013- -2014”, issued by the Main Inspectorate of the Agricultural and Food Quality Inspection (www.ijhar-s.gov.pl), production solely under the organic system was carried out, at that time, by 67% and 60% of organic farms, respectively. The remaining share are entities producing under both organic and conventional methods. According to research, held under the Polish FADN, these farms are highly varied in organisational, production and economic terms. Farms using solely organic methods are distinguished by more holistic approach to executed farming activities, they are also more reliable as regards the quality of manufactured organic food, but they achieve poorer economic results. This is evidenced in the following paper discussing the organisation, production and economic results of such farms grouped according to the size of UAA. Research proved that their production effects over a few years were fairly similar and dropped along with an increase in the area of farms but, at the same time, production intensity dropped. Very poor soil quality also constrained production. The analysis showed that these farms are weak in terms of production and economy, highly dependent on subsidies and rather unlikely to develop in the coming years.";"Grażyna Nachtman";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2015-01-01";"en";"land productivity";"Land & Investments";"AUS;FRA;POL;USA";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610E-033-FAC";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

The definitive version was published in Environmental Research Letters 4 (2009): 044008, doi:10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/044008. Rising sea level threatens existing coastal wetlands. Overall ecosystems could often survive by migrating inland, if adjacent lands remained vacant. On the basis of 131 state and local land use plans, we estimate that almost 60% of the land below 1 m along the US Atlantic coast is expected to be developed and thus unavailable for the inland migration of wetlands. Less than 10% of the land below 1 m has been set aside for conservation. Environmental regulators routinely grant permits for shore protection structures (which block wetland migration) on the basis of a federal finding that these structures have no cumulative environmental impact. Our results suggest that shore protection does have a cumulative impact. If sea level rise is taken into account, wetland policies that previously seemed to comply with federal law probably violate the Clean Water Act.";"C. H. Hershner

"OSF_preprint:461DD-B74-FE9";"Impacts of programs and organizations on the adoption of sustainable land management technologies in Uganda:";"";"The government of Uganda is currently decentralizing many of its services including those directly related to agriculture and the environment. Non-government organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) are being asked to take the lead in the provision of government services such as agricultural extension during the transition to demand driven fee-for-service. This paper explores the role of government programs, NGOs and CBOs in the adoption of land management technologies. We find that government programs were better distributed throughout Uganda and were more likely to operate in poorer areas than NGOs and CBOs. This raises the question of whether or not incentives should be provided for NGOs and CBOs to locate or evolve in less-favored areas. Our analysis of household level involvement in organizations between 1990 and 2000 indicates that female-headed households, households with higher proportions of women, and households with higher levels of natural resource dependence were more likely than other households to be involved in organizations whose main focus was not agriculture or the environment. We also found that social capital is an important determinant of organizational participation. The results of our analysis indicate that the presence of an agriculture or environment focused program or organization at the community level had a negative effect on the adoption of animal manuring and a positive affect on the adoption of pesticides. This suggests that spillover effects of programs and organizations may be greater for technologies that have short-term benefits, and which require some degree of coordination to be most effective. Household level involvement in an agriculture or environment focused organization had a positive effect on the adoption of inorganic fertilizer and mulching. Adoption of land management technologies such as manuring that yield longer-term benefits apparently do not spill over to non-participants in local programs and organizations. Thus, direct involvement of households in programs and organizations that promote such technologies may be necessary to ensure technology diffusion throughout communities. This information may be taken as an indicator of the effectiveness or impact of agriculture and environment focused organizations in Uganda, and should be considered in the broader context of the government devolution of services to NGOs and CBOs. Our findings indicate that careful consideration needs to be given to the potential for NGOs and CBOs to fulfill the roles traditionally filled by government programs in the context of land management. The limited impact of agriculture and environment focused organizations on technology adoption is discouraging though may be linked to the limited profitability of technology adoption in the short-run.

Market imperfections in labor and land markets were found to affect land productivity. Land productivity was positively correlated with household male and female labor force per unit of land. Female-headed households achieved much lower land productivity than male- headed households. Old age of household heads was also correlated with lower land productivity. Imperfections in the rental market for oxen appeared to cause overstocking of oxen by some households. Conservation technologies had no significant positive short-run effect on land productivity.

The results show that land degradation hotspots cover about 51%, 41%, 23% and 23% of the terrestrial areas in Tanzania, Malawi and Ethiopia respectively. The analysis of nationally representative household surveys shows that the key drivers of SLM in these countries are biophysical, demographic, regional and socio-economic determinants. Secure land tenure, access to extension services and market access are some of the determinants incentivizing SLM adoption. The implications of this study are that policies and strategies that facilities secure land tenure and access to SLM information are likely to incentivize investments in SLM.

"OSF_preprint:461E6-4D3-C9F";"Determinants of Agricultural Investment: An Application to Rural China";"";"China, a country developing at unprecedented levels, has experienced drastic changes throughout its recent economic history. Of primary interest is the continuing development and improvement of the rural agricultural sector, with even the slightest changes in this sector having dramatic ripple effects on rural economies. Estimates of rural households involved in agricultural production range from 65 to 70 percent (de Brauw &amp; Rozelle, 2008; Rozelle, Taylor, &amp; de Brauw, 1999). Improvements in agricultural production therefore have a direct impact on the livelihood of rural households in China. Thus, of primary interest are the factors influencing the smallholder farmers' agricultural investment strategies to improve agricultural yields. Households involved in agricultural production can primarily improve their yields through the use of various agricultural improvements made available by ongoing agricultural research. Of utmost interest is the following question: If the returns to agricultural technologies, such as fertilizers, pesticides, genetically-modified seeds, and fixed land improvements, have had positive effects for agricultural households, then what constrains households from applying them? Due to the complexities of the household production decision, literature devoted to finding the answer to this question is limitless and spans almost all regions of the world. However, this analysis focuses on the barriers to investment, potential strategies used to overcome them, and their joint impacts on agricultural investment in rural China. Data in this analysis are cross-sectional, collected over a period of three years between 2006 and 2008 from rural villages within six provinces in China. This analysis is applied over Hunan, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang provinces, intended to capture effects on the investment decision that may differ by region. Households surveyed over the three years total to 4,178, with a total of 3,718 used in this analysis. Of these households, 3,347 (90%) were registered under agricultural hukou, with 3,269 (87.9%) involved in agricultural production during the year of 2008. Major contributions of this analysis stem from the joint assessment of four main factors that influence the household’s agricultural investment decision. More specifically, the impacts of land tenure security, access to credit, education, and migration on agricultural investment are examined. Analysis of each of these four factors is conducted using a Heckman sample selection model across three surveyed provinces. Use of the Heckman model allows us to account for the existence of sample selection bias that exists between those farmers who choose to invest and those who do not. In the first stage of the Heckman model, impacts of each of the four core factors on the likelihood of agricultural investment are quantified. This is followed by a second stage examination of factors influencing the intensity of investment, conditional on the fact that the investment decision has been made. Preliminary findings indicate that each of the four core factors have an influential role on both the likelihood and intensity of investment across rural agricultural households. Across all provinces, agricultural households with more than 80 percent of their landholdings being rented in are less likely to invest. However, conditional on investments being made, these households will tend to invest more intensively than those farmers with a greater proportion of allocated land. Additionally, access to credit has a significant positive impact on both the likelihood and intensity of investment across all agricultural households. Lastly, impacts of education and migration have been mixed, with larger positive impacts noticed from remission income sent home from migrant household laborers. Given negative impacts of land tenure insecurity on the likelihood of investment, it is clear that more should be done to improve the security of rental contracts. The need for this is real and apparent, as nearly 88 percent of rental contracts had not set a clear duration of the lease, and so many rented plots of land are rented under insecure terms (Gao, et al., 2012). Additionally, given positive impacts of credit access on the likelihood and intensity of investment, expansions to the rural credit market could encourage further agricultural investment. Combined, policy improvements and expansions to the rural credit market will produce positive multiplier effects and thus help improve the rural economies within China.";"Ethan R. Young

A key hypothesis is that consolidation of agricultural land in Moldova has beneficial effects in terms of productivity and is desirable in the long run. We examine the case for market-driven land consolidation using data from several recent surveys in Moldova. We show that, in the individual sector, larger farms consume less of their output and attain higher levels of commercialization. Larger individual farms thus have higher revenues from commercial sales and generate higher family incomes. Farm augmentation accordingly makes a positive contribution to the well-being of the rural population. The extent of parcel consolidation is directly correlated with the relative efficiency of farms: consolidated family farms are more efficient than those with fragmented holdings. Hence, land consolidation leads to better economic performance of family farms.";"Anatol Racul

"OSF_preprint:46077-B8D-EB2";"Land Use Change, Carbon Sequestration and Poverty Alleviation";"";"Land use change is a key requirement for improving rural incomes and making a significant reduction in poverty levels globally. Over 70% of the world’s poor are located in rural areas, with land use as a major source of subsistence. Improving the productivity of their land use systems is essential for increasing incomes and food security among them. Land use change is also a relatively low cost and rapidly implementable means of climate change mitigation. To the extent that the land use changes required for poverty alleviation coincide with that required for carbon sequestration, significant synergies can be harnessed in meeting both objectives. Estimates of predicted supply costs and demand prices indicate that several types of land use change appropriate for small and low income landusers will be a competitive source of emission reduction credits, although again there is considerable uncertainty in the final form of the market. However, even where there is significant potential for sequestration payments to contribute to poverty alleviation, considerable effort will be required to move from the objectives to the reality. In some cases this may be made through the structure of carbon sequestration payment programs, to address the investment and insurance needs of poor producers and provide adequate incentives for participation. In other cases larger institutional and policy reforms may be necessary in order to create the conditions necessary for poor landusers to benefit from carbon sequestration payments.

This paper reviews the literature and discusses a number of challenges related to the analysis of the impacts of land administration programs, focusing on developing countries where the starting position is one of land administration systems based on the Napoleonic code, with existing individual rights that may be imperfect and insecure. We examine a set of conceptual and methodological challenges including : 1) a conceptual challenge related to the need to unbundle property rights and to establish the plausible causal chain for land administration interventions; 2) the existence of other binding constraints on productivity, implying the need to consider heterogeneities in policy impacts and the complementarity between property rights and other productive interventions; 3) the need to account for spillovers of land interventions on non-targeted households; and 4) methodological challenges related to the causal identification of the impacts of such interventions.";"Liam Wren-Lewis

Donors advocate a new model of ""willing-buyer/willing-seller\"", market-led land redistribution, but actual redistribution has fallen short of expectations. Little effort has been made so far to formalize the obstacles to market-led land redistribution. In this paper, we show that oligopolistic owner-producers may resist land sales to poorer candidate-buyers not only because they have a lower willingness to pay for land but also because the entry of poorer entrants threatens tacit collusion.";"Christine Valente

With all land state-owned, the threat of land redistribution never appears far off the agenda. Land rental and leasing have been made legal, but transfer rights remain restricted and the perception of continuing tenure insecurity remains quite strong. Using a unique panel data set, this study investigates whether transfer rights and tenure insecurity affect household investment decisions, focusing on trees and shrubs. The panel data estimates suggest that limited perceived transfer rights, and the threat of expropriation, negatively affect long-term investment in Ethiopian agriculture, contributing to the low returns from land and perpetuating low growth and poverty.

The critics argues that the existing land tenure arrangements has contributed towards increased degradation of farmers' land resulting in soil erosion and poor productivity level of various crops. Farmers with ownership right and secure land tenure are more likely to make long-term investment in their land. The meager land productivity is not because of the poor soil fertility rather as a result of ill management of the limiting factor of production i.e. land. Programming model was developed using primary information, collected from 110 farmers' households (82 High income group + 28 Low income group) from 4 peasant associations in Meket District of north wollo region of Ethiopia in order to study the potential of land productivity enhancement through better land management and land use planning in the country. The optimal solutions brought out that land productivity increased by 9.4 percent on high-income group and 8 percent on low-income group farmers with an overall improvement of 8 percent in the region if farmers cultivate their land with more vigor and long-term commitments. Thus there is an urgent need to revisit the government policies especially with regard to land use planning, land tenure and ownership right etc for achieving the long term agricultural development.

In this Paper I analyse how the distribution of land rights affects the choice of both contractible techniques – such as crop mix or irrigation – and non-contractible effort when these are complements in production. I present evidence from rural Nicaragua suggesting that farmers are more likely to grow effort-intensive/highly profitable crops on the plots they own rather than on the plots they rent. I consider two theoretical arguments that illustrate why property rights might matter. The first relies on the fact that the agent who chooses effort is subject to a limited liability constraint, the second that the owner cannot commit to output-contingent contracts. In both models the choice of technique might be inefficient, regardless of the distribution of property rights. The efficiency loss is, however, lower when the farmer owns the land. Further empirical investigation shows that, in this context, the inability to commit seems to be the main source of inefficiency. agricultural productivity; asymmetric information; crop choices";"Oriana Bandiera";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2014-12-04";"en";"land;land distribution";"";"NIC;NOR";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614B-089-21C";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

Land use changes to reduce pollution incur opportunity costs that are privately known to landholders, but these changes provide environmental benefits that may be more accurately estimated by regulators. This paper reports a testbed laboratory experiment in which landholder/sellers in multi-round, sealed-offer auctions compete to obtain part of a fixed budget allocated by the regulator to subsidize pollution abatement. In one treatment the regulator reveals to landholders the environmental benefits estimated for their alternative projects, and in another treatment the regulator conceals the potential projects’ “environmental quality.” The results show that sellers’ offers misrepresent their costs more for high quality projects when quality is revealed, so total abatement is lower and seller profits are higher when landholders know their projects’ environmental benefits. This suggests that concealing this information may improve regulatory efficiency.";"Charlotte Duke

They do not only choose their effort level, however, but also make investment decisions between projects of different risk-return profiles. We develop a small theoretical model that integrates the effort effect of sharecropping as well as the risk-reducing aspect of sharecropping which allows analyzing the implications for production, risk-management and risk-coping. In the empirical analysis, we combine a household survey taken in eleven African countries with data on climate risk to test the theoretical predictions. We find that sharecropping is endogenous to climate: it is more frequent in regions with low rainfall and higher weather variability. In a second step we test whether sharecropping can function as a substitute to other risk adaptation strategies. We find that sharecropping farmers are less likely to own livestock and more likely to use fertilizer. In economies where formal kinds of insurance are unavailable, sharecropping thus functions as a form of insurance and reduces the need for potentially harmful risk management strategies.";"Gregor Schwerhoff

It is related to recent controversies about the detrimental impact of land laws on deforestation, which seem to legitimize land encroachments. The latter is mainly the result of land tenure insecurity which is a key characteristic of this region and results from a long history of interactions between rural social unrest and land reforms or land laws. A simple model is developed where strategic interactions between farmers lead to excessive deforestation. One of the empirical implications of the model is a positive relationship between land tenure insecurity and the extent of deforestation. The latter is tested on data from a panel of Brazilian Amazon municipalities. The negative effect of land tenure insecurity proxied by the number of squatters on deforestation is not rejected when estimations are controlled for the possible endogeneity of squatters. One of the main policy implications is that ex post legalizations of settlements must be accompanied by the enforcement of environmental obligations.";"Pascale Combes Motel

This study utilizes household and plot level data from rural Kenya to explore the linkage between land access and food security. We find that a 10% increase in operated land size would increase total cereal consumption and home produced food consumption by 0.8% and 2.0%, respectively. We also find that land rental is the dominant mechanism that poor rural farmers use to access additional land for cultivation. However, the levels of long-term land investment (measured by applications of organic manure) and land productivity are significantly lower for rented plots than for own plots even after household fixed-effect and plot level observed characteristics are controlled for. Furthermore, land rental markets do not allow farmers to fully adjust their operated land size to their optimal level. These findings point to the existence of problems with land rental markets that impede their ability to fully contribute to national food security and poverty reduction goals.";"Rie Muraoka

This paper provides a review of how the issues of decentralization are linked to land tenure reform, in theory and practice. Both decentralization and land tenure reform each encompass a number of different, but related concepts and approaches. We begin with clarifying some key terms related to these different approaches, then look in more detail at contending perspectives on decentralization, and how these relate to the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) pillars of democratic governance. We then review the different types of land tenure reform in terms of the role of centralized and decentralized institutions, illustrating the strengths and weaknesses, gaps and challenges with experience from a range of developing countries. The final section turns to conclusions and policy recommendations, considering how decentralized approaches to land tenure reform can contribute to goals such as gender equity, social cohesion, human rights, and the identity of indigenous peoples."" authors' abstract Decentralization, Land, Tenure reform, Democratic governance, Rights, Registration, Redistribution, Restitution, Recognition, Devolution,";"Ruth Meinzen-Dick

Further, the impact of variables describing the regional farm structure, thereby indicating market power of the large, the potential of high competition for land within a region and possibly high rents of the status quo in combination with sunk costs, is quantified.

Under these circumstances labour supply can be inefficiently distorted to safeguard the plots from encroachment. Using panel data, we study the variation of household labour supply following a land registration programme which has demarcated agricultural landholdings with cornerstones and has issued a documentary evidence of the household land rights. Our results indicate that after the registration of their landholdings, households with a land certificate have reduced total time allocated to farming activities with no impact on agricultural yields. The reduction in labour supply is primarily driven by a decrease of time allocated to the pre-planting season. This is consistent with qualitative evidence that plots under cultivation have no visible sign of demarcation during pre-planting and disputes arise as neighbouring landholders pushed the boundaries of their plots while ploughing. Following land registration, the cornerstones reduce the need for guarding parcels as they make encroachment easier to detect.";"Kenneth Houngbedji

Hence there is the need for this study which was designed to analyze the determinants of farmers’ adoption of Sustainable Land Management Practices (SLMP) in the production of maize and cassava in Ogun State. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted in this study. The data for study was collected from 338 farmers with the use of questionnaire. Information collected covered farmers’ socio-economic, institutional and farm level characteristics and specific SLMPs used. The SLMPs studied included Structural and Mechanical Erosion Control (SMEC), Agronomic Practices (AP), Cultivation Practices (CP) and Soil Management Practices (SMP). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the logit model. The farmers had an average of nine years of formal education, 54% participated in Community Based Organizations (CBOs), and 91% had access to extension education, 55% had land tenancy security 81% favoured the use of AP more than other SLMPs. About 47% of the farmers cultivated undulating farmlands which were vulnerable to degradation. Farmers’ level of education and their participation in CBOs positively influenced their adoption of the SLMPs.

Soil and water sampling spots were selected based on free and grid survey techniques and their locations were taken using Global Positioning System (GPS). Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques were used to develop irrigation land suitability map of the study area. Attributes of parameters were collected and used for suitability assessment. Attributes used as criteria for irrigation suitability analysis were ECe, ESP, soil depth, texture, pH, top and sub soil stoniness, water table depth, flood hazard, ground water quality (SAR and EC) and slope. Point data with their attribute were arranged and proximity analysis of Arc-GIS was made this resulted into twelve mapping units. The final irrigation suitability map of the project area was derived after overlay analysis.

Despite the wealth of theoretical and empirical studies on this subject, there is no study that has reviewed existing literature in light of concerns over sustainable and equitable management. This chapter fills the gap by analyzing and synthesizing available literature to put some structure on existing knowledge. The paper has a threefold contribution to the literature. First, it takes stock of what we know so far about the determinants of land grab. Second, it presents a picture of sustainable and equitable development of the foreign land acquisitions. Third, policy syndromes are examined and policy implications discussed. Based on the accounts, the issues are not about whether agricultural investments are needed, but on how they can be sustainably and equitably managed to make positive contributions to food security and domestic development.

Evidence from Malawi";"";"Tenure insecurity can have important consequences for the conservation of natural resources. Land titling is often considered a solution to the problem of weak investment incentives under tenure insecurity. Using a large plot-level dataset from Malawi, this paper shows that land titling alone might not induce greater investment in soil conservation under the existing customary inheritance systems and that a reform of the rental market is in order. The paper focuses on two main sources of tenure insecurity: informal short-term tenancy contracts and customary gender-biased inheritance practices. Both sources of insecurity matter for soil conservation investments and are likely to be unaffected by the introduction of land titling alone. Further evidence suggests that soil erosion can have adverse distributional effects and that tenure insecurity accounts for one-third of the long-term loss in land productivity.";"Stefania Lovo";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2014-07-31";"en";"tenure insecurity";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Land Conflicts;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"MWI";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46178-000-7FC";"http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WP114-tenure-insecurity-investment-soil-conservation-malawi.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""

The econometric land use model was analyzed as an equation by equation SURE model as all the independent variables were the same for both equations. In analyzing effect of land use change on water quality, we took year 2005 as our baseline and postulated three land use scenarios. We applied Benefit Transfer techniques to value water quality changes resulting from land use change and estimated lower bounds for WTP to improve water quality to meet the FCB criterion for drinking water supply and fishing waters and BOD (DO) criteria for fishing waters. Water quality modeling revealed that land use change would result in increased runoff, and associated increase in FCB and BOD/DO violations. But the BOD/DO violations could be curtailed by managing urban growth as evidenced absence of BOD violations in the managed growth scenario. Our study finds there may be problems of FCB under all postulated future land use scenarios. The findings also support existing literature that there are problems with FCB violation in the study area at the moment. Finally, it seems that the people of UCRB would be willing to pay a lower bound value between USD 15,785,740 and USD 16,141,230 per year to create and maintain quality standards for fishing and drinking water supply.

The point of departure of my argument is the Ili- Wawas Integrated Project, a combined logging and agricultural project which seeks to bring economic development to the remote Pomio district of East New Britain Province by connecting existing logging roads to the limited national road network around the provincial capital. Developing the national road network and creating standardized or—to use James Scott’s concept—legible environments can be seen as an integral part of state-making and strengthening the role of the state. In addition to the environment, the state also needs to make social life legible in forms of maps, censuses and laws. As I will argue in my paper, the Ili-Wawas, and other similar projects, may indeed strengthen the role of the state not only by creating the infrastructure and legibility needed by the state, but also in unintended and accidental ways. The side effects of logging and road building include, among others, fear of crime and land disputes. It is these that create among the locals a perceived need for state institutions, which may be as significant in advancing the role of the state as is the creation of infrastructure and legibility.";"Tuomas Tammisto";"";"Center for Open Science";"Center for Open Science";"2018-12-16";"en";"development;land dispute";"Land Conflicts;Land in Post-Conflict Settings;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"PNG";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603A-026-25C";"http://osf.io/fxyh7/download";"";"";"";"";"";""

We examine why landowners elected to lease rather than sell land and attribute the rise of leasehold to legal constraints on land sales by large estates and the federal tax code. Ideological forces initiated land reform in 1967, but rent-seeking forces captured the process in the mid-1970s.

"OSF_preprint:461E3-671-F0E";"FOOD-FOR-WORK FOR POVERTY REDUCTION AND THE PROMOTION OF SUSTAINABLE LAND USE: CAN IT WORK?";"";"Food-for-work (FFW) programs are commonly used both for short-term relief and long-term development purposes. In the latter capacity, they are increasingly used for natural resources management projects. Barrett, Holden and Clay (forthcoming) assess the suitability of FFW programs as insurance to cushion the poor against short-term, adverse shocks that could, in the absence of a safety net, have permanent repercussions. In this paper we explore the complementary question of FFW programs' potential to reduce poverty and promote sustainable land use in the longer run through induced changes in investment patterns. FFW programs commonly aim to produce or maintain potentially valuable public goods necessary to stimulate productivity and thus income growth. Among the most common projects are road building, reforestation, and the installation of terracing or irrigation. In the abstract, public goods such as these are unambiguously good. There is a danger, however, that such programs could discourage private soil and water conservation and crowd out private investment. How important are such effects and when are these effects small or large and when and how can they be reduced? How do market characteristics, timing and design of FFW programs affect this? When, where and how can FFW programs more efficiently reduce poverty and promote more sustainable land management? The paper aims to answer these questions. Much recent empirical research has focused on the shorter-term targeting issue of whether FFW and related workfare programs efficiently target the poor (Dev 1995, Von Braun 1995, Webb 1995, Subbarao 1997, Clay et al. 1998, Devereux 1999, Jayne et al. 1999, Ravallion 1999, Teklu and Asefa 1999, Atwood et al. 2000, Gebremedhin and Swinton 2000, Haddad and Adato 2001, Jalan and Ravallion 2001). Much less research has been focused on the longer-term effects of FFW. Yet the large share of hunger worldwide arises due to chronic deprivation and vulnerability, not short-term shocks (Speth 1993, Barrett 2002). Also most of the FFW programs in Ethiopia have long-term development goals and are formally distinguished from the disaster relief FFW programs (Aas and Mellemstrand 2002). It is therefore appropriate to evaluate these programs based on their long-term goals and not only on the basis of short-term targeting. In a case study in Tigray Aas and Mellemstrand (2002) found that the FFW recipients considered the long-term benefits of FFW as more important than the short-term benefits of food provision. FFW programs may produce valuable public goods. For example, Von Braun et al. (1999) report multiplier effects of a FFW-built road in the Ethiopian lowlands. Public provision of public goods may be socially desirable because private investment in soil and water conservation and tree planting may be well below socially optimal levels due to poverty and market imperfections (Holden, Shiferaw and Wik 1998, Holden and Shiferaw 2002, Holden and Yohannes 2002, Pender and Kerr 1998), tenure insecurity (Gebremedhin and Swinton 2000, Holden, Benin, Shiferaw and Pender 2003), lack of technical knowledge and coordination problems across farms (Hagos and Holden 2002). There is, however, also a danger that FFW programs crowd out private investments (Gebremedhin and Swinton 2000). We analyze these issues using multiple methods. First, section II introduces a simple theoretical framework for understanding the analytically ambiguous effects of FFW programs on sustainable land use patterns. We first present the basic intuition in a static framework to illustrate the selection, crowding out and targeting issues, before generalizing it to a dynamic model to illustrate the possible insurance and crowding in effects of FFW. Section III then uses an applied, dynamic bio-economic farm household model applied to a less-favoured area in Ethiopia to investigate via numerical simulation how household welfare and land use patterns vary with changes in environmental and FFW program design parameters. Section IV presents econometric evidence based on survey panel data from northern Ethiopia to assess the relationship between FFW and private investment in conservation. Section V discusses our findings and fleshes them out a bit with further empirical evidence. Section VI concludes. Food Security and Poverty, Q18, O1, Q2, I1,";"Stein T. Holden

Nevertheless, some crops such as maize, sugarcane, and oilseeds expanded area more rapidly than the average rise. Although, some economists attribute this effect to biofuel production, economy also has encouraged expansion in cropland to satisfy food demand. This paper analyzes the impact that biofuel production and economic variables has had on harvested area for corn, sugar, and oilseeds. Our results suggest that economic variables are much more important than ethanol production in explaining changes on harvested area of corn and sugarcane.

This is the largest database of Japan's land prices, and consists of approximately 30,000 points for each year of a 6-year period (1995-2000). By analyzing the data on the assessed value of land, we were able to determine the power law distributions of the land prices and of the relative prices of the land. The data fits to a very good degree the approximation of power law distributions. We also found that the price fluctuations were amplified with the level of the price.

"OSF_preprint:46212-A5B-968";"A probabilistic graphical model approach in 30 m land cover mapping with multiple data sources";"";"There is a trend to acquire high accuracy land-cover maps using multi-source classification methods, most of which are based on data fusion, especially pixel- or feature-level fusions. A probabilistic graphical model (PGM) approach is proposed in this research for 30 m resolution land-cover mapping with multi-temporal Landsat and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Independent classifiers were applied to two single-date Landsat 8 scenes and the MODIS time-series data, respectively, for probability estimation. A PGM was created for each pixel in Landsat 8 data. Conditional probability distributions were computed based on data quality and reliability by using information selectively. Using the administrative territory of Beijing City (Area-1) and a coastal region of Shandong province, China (Area-2) as study areas, multiple land-cover maps were generated for comparison. Quantitative results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall accuracies promoted from 74.0% (maps acquired from single-temporal Landsat images) to 81.8% (output of the PGM) for Area-1. Improvements can also be seen when using MODIS data and only a single-temporal Landsat image as input (overall accuracy: 78.4% versus 74.0% for Area-1, and 86.8% versus 83.0% for Area-2). Information from MODIS data did not help much when the PGM was applied to cloud free regions of. One of the advantages of the proposed method is that it can be applied where multi-temporal data cannot be simply stacked as a multi-layered image. Comment: 38 pages, 5 figures";"Luyan Ji

The definitive version was published in Restoration Ecology 14 (2006): 220-232, doi:10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00124.x. The decline in grasslands and other species-rich early-successional habitats on the coastal sandplains of the northeastern U.S. has spurred management to increase the area of these declining plant communities. We mechanically removed overstory oak and applied seed from a nearby sandplain grassland on the island of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts to evaluate this technique for creating an open oak community able to support sandplain herbaceous species. We compared vegetation structure and composition before and after clearing in an area of total tree removal (clearcutting), an area where 85% of tree basal area was removed (savanna cutting) and in adjacent coastal oak forest. Plant responses to clearcutting and savanna cutting were similar. Sandplain herbs colonized at high frequencies after seeding and increasing herbaceous cover from &lt;7% before clearing to 22-38% three growing seasons later. Carex pensylvanica (Pennsylvania sedge) increased in cover ~ 6-fold, accounting for 84-90% of the increased herbaceous cover. Other native ruderals, and exotic herbs reached 6%, 2%, and 1%, cover respectively, after three years. Species richness across cleared treatments increased from 30 to 79 species. All forest species were retained. Forest shrubs and trees initially declined from their dominant cover, but rebounded after three years. Tree clearing plus seeding appeared to be a viable management practice for increasing cover of herbaceous sandplain species while causing minimal increases in exotic herbaceous cover. The long-term persistence of sandplain herbs may require periodic disturbances that limit woody regrowth. This work was funded by grants from the A. W.

"OSF_preprint:461DD-685-DEE";"An institutional analysis of land markets";"";"For many years, land markets have been analyzed as though parcels of land were being traded in a frictionless market subject to no rules. To the extent that there were rules which could not be ignored – such as land-use regulations – the effect of these was incorporated as ‘distortions’ to the market. An institutional analysis of land markets, on the contrary, starts by looking the the rules which structure the exchange of rights in land. These are the formal rules regulating such things as access to the market, which rights may be traded and which not, land-use and environmental rules, fiscal rules, inheritance rules. Then there are the informal rules, customary practices, taken-for-granted ways of doing things. All those rules create a structure which affects the availability of information, risk and uncertainty, transaction costs, organizations for buyers and sellers and brokers, etc. It is assumed that people act in a rational way within that structure. The results are the market outcomes: what is traded where, by whom, in what volume, at what price? This paper sets out the method for such an institutional analysis and applies it to two land markets in the Netherlands – for agricultural land and for land on industrial estates. The results of applying this analysis allow market outcomes to be explained better than by an analysis which ignores institutions. The paper is based on research carried out by the authors at the Netherlands Institute for Spatial Research (Ruimtelijk Planbureau).";"Barrie Needham

Here, we quantify the potential contribution of Indigenous lands to biodiversity conservation using case studies of Australia, Brazil and Canada. Indigenous lands in each country are slightly more species rich than existing protected areas and, in Brazil and Canada, support more threatened species than existing protected areas or random sites. These results indicate that Indigenous lands and existing protected areas are similar in biodiversity. Enhanced partnerships between Indigenous communities and federal or state governments could help ameliorate current shortfalls in global biodiversity protection by facilitating protection for native species, helping to stem global biodiversity loss.";"Nicholas Reo

I present evidence suggesting that Nicaraguan farmers are more likely to grow effort-intensive crops on owned rather than on rented plots.

In both cases choices might be inefficient regardless of land distribution. The efficiency loss, however, is lower when the farmer owns the land. Further evidence suggests that, in this context, the inefficiency derives from lack of commitment.

"OSF_preprint:4611A-49C-4CD";"Land institutions and land markets";"";"In agrarian societies land serves as the main means not only for generating a livelihood but often also for accumulating wealth and transferring it between generations. How land rights are assigned therefore determines households'ability to generate subsistence and income, their social and economic status (and in many cases their collective identity), their incentive to exert nonobservable effort and make investments, and often their ability to access financial markets or to make arrangements for smoothing consumption and income. With imperfections in other markets, the institutions governing the allocation of land rights and the functioning of land markets will have implications for overall efficiency as well as equity. The authors examine how property rights in land evolve from a situation of land abundance. They discuss factors affecting the costs and benefits of individual land rights and highlight the implications of tenure security for investment incentives. They also review factors affecting participation in land sales and rental markets, particularly the characteristics of the agricultural production process, labor supervision cost, credit access, the risk characteristics of an individual's asset portfolio, and the transaction costs associated with market participation. These factors will affect land sales and rental markets differently. Removing obstacles to the smooth functioning of land rental markets and taking measures to enhance potential tenants'endowments and bargaining power can significantly increase both the welfare of the poor and the overall efficiency of resource allocation. Drawing on their conceptual discussion, the authors draw policy conclusions about the transition from communal to individual and more formal land rights, steps that might be taken to improve the functioning of land sales and rental markets, and the scope for redistributive land reform.

"OSF_preprint:461F2-13A-109";"Social exclusion and land administration in Orissa, India";"";"The authors report on the first empirical study of its kind to examine - from the perspective of transaction costs - factors that constrain access to land for the rural poor and other socially excluded groups in India. They find that: a) Land reform has reduced large landholdings since the 1950s. Medium size farms have gained most. Formidable obstacles still prevent the poor from gaining access to land. b) The complexity of land revenue administration in Orissa is partly the legacy of distinctly different systems, which produced more or less complete and accurate land records. These not-so-distant historical records can be important in resolving contemporary land disputes. c) Orissa tried legally to abolish land-leasing. Concealed tenancy persisted, with tenants having little protection under the law. d) Women's access to and control over land, and their bargaining power with their husbands about land, may be enhanced through joint land titling, a principle yet to be realized in Orissa. e) Land administration is viewed as a burden on the state rather than a service, and land records and registration systems are not coordinated. Doing so will improve rights for the poor and reduce transaction costs - but only if the system is transparent and the powerful do not retain the leverage over settlement officers that has allowed land grabs. Land in Orissa may be purchased, inherited, rented (leased), or - in the case of public land and the commons - encroached upon. Each type of transaction - and the State's response, through land law and administration - has implications for poor people's access to land. The authors find that: 1) Land markets are thin and transaction costs are high, limiting the amount of agricultural land that changes hands. 2) The fragmentation of landholdings into tiny, scattered plots is a brake on agricultural productivity, but efforts to consolidate land may discriminate against the rural poor. Reducing transaction costs in land markets will help. 3) Protecting the rural poor's rights of access to common land requires raising public awareness and access to information. 4) Liberalizing land-lease markets for the rural poor will help, but only if the poor are ensured access to institutional credit.

"OSF_preprint:46210-5E1-2C8";"Does Land Registration Guarantee Access to Formal Capital for Investment?";"";"""The proposition that it is land registration, which determines accessibility to formal credit for investment is common knowledge. Such a proposition is premised on the argument that land registration enables owners of registered landed property to use their property as collateral for loans from financial institutions. A sequel to these arguments are the assertions that: (a) western nations are highly capitalised and developed due to the fact that they have comprehensive land registration systems; and (b) high level of poverty and underdevelopment exits in third world countries because it is an infinitesimal proportion of landed property ownership that is registered, which it is argued, impedes the ability of owners to use their property as collateral to access formal capital for investment and wealth creation. Based on the preceding commonly held views, developing countries, backed by international donor institutions like the World Bank, have been religiously pursuing land registration policies and programmes over the years. However, despite many years of the implementation of land registration programmes, poverty and underdevelopment still exists in pandemic proportions in the third world. Considering Africa, for example, research conducted by the World Bank in 2007 shows that the region is a critical development priority since it has some of the world's poorest countries and during the past two decades, the number of poor people in the continent has doubled to 300 million, which is more than 40 percent of the continent's population. It is against this background that this paper examines the extent to which land registration guarantees access to investment capital. It seeks to report the findings of a pilot research project, which is surveying five financial institutions ñ three in Ghana, a developing country and two in Britain, a developed country. The survey is currently in progress and will be completed in due course.""""";"Abdulai R.T.

In the study region, super-large agroholdings, large-scale enterprises and smaller individual farms emerged side-by-side and now compete for resources in a homogenous production environment. Drawing on two survey rounds of farm-level data, we find that the agroholdings display the highest factor productivity and are the most competitive on land and labour markets among all farms. However, we also find constant technical returns to scale across farm types and a layer of smaller family farms that is highly competitive on land markets. It is thus too early to conclude that large corporate farms are economically superior to individual (family) farms. But the present analysis clearly calls into question that family farms are a per-se desirable or even the only viable way of organising agricultural production.

"OSF_preprint:4608F-E13-7BF";"Temporal Spillovers in Land Conservation";"";"Temporal spillovers occur when a conservation program changes what happens to land outside the temporal window of the conservation contract. This may happen when conservation improves land so that returns to non-conservation uses are increased, or when landowners' preferences become more pro-conservation as they see land flourish under conservation, for example. These post-contract changes may occur on the extensive margin (acres of land conserved) or intensive margin (intensity of land in a given use). If temporal spillovers exist, benefits from conservation programs estimated by focusing solely on the effects that occur during the conservation contract will overstate or understate the true benefits of the program. I lay out a simple model of temporal spillovers. I test this model in the context of the United States Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). I use a pre-analysis sample specification step to choose counterfactual land most like the CRP land. On the extensive margin, I find that CRP causes some land to be 22-27% more likely to be farmed, potentially offsetting some environmental benefits. However, farmed ex-CRP land is slightly more likely to use a conservation practice. This is a mitigating factor on the intensive margin. temporal spillovers, slippage, land use, payments for environmental services, Conservation Reserve Program";"Sarah Jacobson";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2014-05-15";"en";"land;land conservation";"Land, Climate Change & Environment";"NOR";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-E13-7BF";"http://web.williams.edu/Economics/wp/Jacobson_temporal_spillovers_feb2014.pdf";"";"";"";"";"";""

Access to agricultural land is a constitutional right for rural residents of Ethiopia. We used survey data from the relatively land abundant districts of Oromia Region and from the land scarce districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ (SNNP) Region. We found that youth in the rural south have limited potential to obtain agricultural land that can be a basis for viable livelihood. The law prohibits the purchase and sale of land in Ethiopia. We found that land access through allocation from authorities is virtually nonexistent while land that can be obtained from parents through inheritance or gift is too small to establish a meaningful livelihood. The land rental market has restrictions, including on the number of years land can be rented out. Perhaps as a result of limited land access, the youth have turned their back on agriculture. Our study shows that only nine percent of youth in these rural areas plan to pursue farming. The majority are planning non-agricultural livelihoods. We also found a significant rural-urban migration among the youth and especially in areas with severe agricultural land scarcity. Our econometric analyses show that youth from families with larger land holding are less likely to choose non-agricultural livelihood as well as less likely to migrate to urban areas. We suggest here some measures to improve rural livelihood such as creation of non-farm employment opportunities and improvement of land rental markets. We also argue that as a certain level of rural-urban migration is unavoidable, investigating youth migration is essential to design policies that help the migrating youth as well as the host communities.

Specifically, it examined the transaction costs associated with land tenure contracts, the land tenure contract preference, the efficiency of land tenure contracts, and the policy agenda to address the problems of land tenure efficiency. Three types of land tenure contracts were considered: sharecropping, fixed rental and mortgage. Farm plot data were used to econometrically investigate whether transaction cost had an effect on the choice of land tenure contracts and on the efficiency of land tenure contracts. The transaction cost coefficient of 0.097 (significant of 1% level) in the choice of land tenure indicates that as the value of transaction cost increases, the landlord will most likely choose sharecropping. However, if the transaction cost decreases, it is more likely that the landlord will choose mortgage or fixed rental. These findings show that contract choice of landlord’s is influenced by the transaction cost. The results show that sharecropping is the more efficient land tenure arrangement in West Java, Indonesia. Thus it does not support the Marshallian view of sharecropping as an inefficient land tenure arrangement. Sharecropping in the study area is benefiting both the landlord and the tenant farmers. Transaction cost dismisses as labor monitoring is needed to the barest minimum and higher marginal product is achieved. Adoption of sharecropping in West Java like support the government program of consolidating rice farm to attain scale in economics’ and utilization more efficiently farm labor.

"OSF_preprint:460C0-620-7F6";"Tenure Insecurity, Adverse Selection, and Liquidity in Rural Land Markets";"";"A theory of land market activity is developed for settings where there is uncertainty and private information about the security of land tenure. Land sellers match with buyers in a competitive search environment, and an illiquid land market emerges as a screening mechanism. As a consequence, adverse selection and an insecure system of property rights stifle land market transactions. The implications of the theory are tested using household level data from Indonesia. As predicted, formally titled land is more liquid than untitled land in the sense that ownership rights are more readily transferable.

"OSF_preprint:4621D-69F-576";"Exploring the Cost Effectiveness of Land Conservation Auctions and Payment Policies";"";"Until recently public efforts to encourage conservation on private land in many countries has primarily been through uniform payment policies. Auctions are increasingly used as a payment mechanism to acquire public benefits such as conservation actions that provide environmental improvements on private land (e.g. the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The economic rationale for use of auctions is that they create decentralised incentives to offer bids at close to the true landholder opportunity costs, even when the implementing agency holds little information about these opportunity costs. This paper assesses the cost of a case study auction relative to four payment policies that use varying levels of information strategically to reduce rent payment and to prioritise funding based on environmental value. The results suggest that the estimated cost savings achievable with the discriminant price auction for conservation contracts depends on the policy to which the auction outcomes are compared. Auction cost savings are likely to be greatest when compared to policy alternatives involving little effort to discriminate amongst offers based on differences in landholder opportunity costs. A further key finding is that, for this case study, most of the savings resulting from the discriminant price auction could be attributed to the use of the environmental benefits index in project ranking and selection.

"OSF_preprint:46189-581-34E";"LAND CONSOLIDATION AS A FACTOR FOR SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN MOLDOVA";"";"Since 1991, Moldova has carried out a wide range of radical reforms affecting its social and economic system. The land reform, which was practically completed in 2000, created over 1 million landowners among the rural population. Many of them entrusted their land to managers of newly created corporate farms. Others used their privately owned land to establish independent family farms. The creation of independent family farms (so-called ""peasant farms"") was one of the primary goals of the land reform. More than 280,000 peasant farms have been created, averaging 1,86 hectares in size. The small size of the peasant farms, whose holdings are furthermore split into 3-4 parcels, raises considerable concerns about their long-term viability and has led to an intense public debate regarding the impacts of fragmentation. In this paper, we use the data from several recent surveys in Moldova to support the case for land consolidation. We show that, in the individual sector, larger farms produce higher family incomes and thus farm augmentation makes a positive contribution to the well-being of the rural population. We also show that, for farms of a given size, productivity increases as the number of parcels decreases. After demonstrating the economic advantages of consolidation, we proceed to discuss the actual use of various market mechanisms for land consolidation, including leasing as well as buying and selling of land. We then show that, in our surveys, farms with leased land are in fact larger than farms that rely on owned land only. This completes the logical circle of our argument: land consolidation leads to better economic performance, while land leasing is actually used as a market mechanism for consolidation, which benefits both lessees (through increased farm incomes) and lessors (through income from lease payments for their land). land consolidation, land lease, land market, Moldova, Land Economics/Use,";"Dragos Cimpoies

Land administration projects can include a variety of activities. Usually, the most expensive and that which is most likely to have direct, tangible benefits is land titling. The provision of titles to landowners is only part of complex process, however. Titles by themselves are unlikely to bring lasting benefits unless there is a functioning registry and cadastre and a system to adjudicate disputes. Land titling can generate many benefits, including improved efficiency of land markets, reduction in conflict over land, enhanced access to credit, and improved incentives to invest in agricultural production. Where the conditions are appropriate, titling can bring important benefits. Conditions, however, are not always appropriate. Moreover, land administration projects can be quite costly. Carrying out an economic analysis is necessary to determine whether the benefits to be achieved in a given situation are sufficient to justify the costs. Until recently, however, economic analyses have generally not been carried out for land administration projects. This manual explains the principles and approach that such an economic analysis should follow.

Whether the impacts are indeed as devastating as the popular notion of ""land grabs"" would suggest depends on a number of factors, including the size of compensation payments, productivity spillovers on smallholders, employment opportunities for displaced farmers, and changes in food prices. We study the local welfare effects of land acquisitions in Sub-Saharan Africa using a theoretical model that captures the major channels through which land deals might affect rural African populations. We distinguish two basic scenarios. In the first scenario, the investor plants capital intensive staple food crops. Displaced farmers compete for a very limited number of jobs on the investment farm and spillovers to the remaining local farmers are rare. In the second scenario, where the investor is assumed to plant cash crops, potential spillovers through contract farming are larger and production is more labor intensive and hence provides better employment prospects. In both scenarios the crop produced on the investment farm is exported. The net welfare outcome varies with the relative strengths of the contradicting effects of spillovers, wages and food prices.

As archaeological sites are generally spread over a large area, use of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly applicable in the world. The main objective of this study is to map the land cover of the Itanos area of Crete and of its changes, with specific focus on the detection of the landscape’s archaeological features. Six satellite images were acquired from the Pleiades and WorldView-2 satellites over a period of 3 years. In addition, digital imagery of two known archaeological sites was used for validation. An object-based image analysis classification was subsequently developed using the five acquired satellite images. Two rule sets were created, one using the standard four bands which both satellites have and another for the two WorldView-2 images with their four extra bands included. Validation of the thematic maps produced from the classification scenarios confirmed a difference in accuracy amongst the five images. Comparing the results of a 4-band rule set versus the 8-band rule set showed a slight increase in classification accuracy using extra bands. The resultant classifications showed a good level of accuracy exceeding 70%. Yet, separating the archaeological sites from the open spaces with little or no vegetation proved to be challenging. This was mainly due to the high spectral similarity between rocks and the archaeological ruins. The high resolution of the satellite data allowed for the accuracy in defining larger archaeological sites, but still there was difficulty in distinguishing smaller areas of interest. The digital image data provided a very good 3D representation for the archaeological sites, assisting as well as in validating the satellite-derived classification maps. To conclude, our study provides further evidence that use of high resolution imagery may allow for archaeological sites to be located, but only where the archaelogical features are of an adequate size.";"Swaiti Suman

While theory predicts that better property rights on land can increase investment through increased security, enhanced trade opportunities and increased collateral value of land, the presence and size of these effects depend crucially on whether those rights are properly enforced. In Nicaragua, a troubled history of land expropriation and invasion has undermined the credibility of the legal property regime. The variation in legal ownership status due to a land titling and regularization programme is studied to identify the effects of legal ownership documents. Possession of a registered document is found to increase the probability of carrying out land-attached investments by 35%. No difference is found in the effect of public deeds and agrarian reform titles provided they are both registered and we find no strong evidence of a credit supply link, thus suggesting security of tenure as the channel through which formal land ownership has an effect on investment.

Our application is for the state of Minnesota, and we consider the acquisitions by Department of Natural Resources over the last two decades. We calculate a return on investment (ROI) in conservation showing the increase in the value of ecosystem goods and services from public lands per dollar spent on acquisition. A spatially-explicit modeling tool, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), quantifies how changes in land use and land cover (LULC) influence the provision and value of a suite of ecosystem services: carbon sequestration, timber production, water quality, habitat quality, and outdoor recreation. The present value of the difference in the value of ecosystem services from landscapes with and without acquisitions in 1992 and for the econometrically modeled future landscapes in 2022 and 2052 is the return from the investment in the acquisitions. We find a limited number of acquisitions have a ROI above one. Also, we observe the estimated return in the acquisitions is much more influenced by the economic value of ecosystem services than the projected development threat to the acquisitions.

The multiple forest functions are limited in this research to wood production and erosion prevention. Ukraine is faced with erosion on 35% of its arable lands. Some 20 million ha of lands are experiencing various stages of erosion, and it is increasing with time. Erosion is especially harmful in the Carpathian Mountains where it causes windthrows and floods, and in the Steppe zone where it results in blowing up sands. Along with exploration of the expanded timber supply from the newly created forest plantations, soil protection forest functions therefore are examined. The proposition that forest cover affects the rates of soil erosion is tested empirically by means of regression analysis. The results of the estimations show a statistically significant negative relationship between soil erosion and forest cover in Ukraine and across the forestry zones. Using the results of the analysis, indicative estimates of the soil protection role of the forests are computed. Further discussion focuses on the proposed expansion of forest cover and on the potential positive effects for agriculture due to erosion prevention. Calculations have been made at different levels of detail. By using a simulation technique and cost-benefit analysis, in combination with LP modelling, it is revealed that for the discount rate of 4%, planting trees on bare lands, except in the Polissja and the Crimea, is an economically efficient means to address wood production and erosion prevention. Results are highly dependent on the relevant discount rate. For marginal agricultural lands mixed results are obtained. Moreover, there is a difference between estimated benefits for agriculture and benefits for the planter of the trees. It seems therefore necessary that e.g. the government balances costs and benefits to provide incentives for the planter of the trees. Finally, the research comes up with some practical suggestions for forest management decisions.";"Arie Oskam

During the 1990s and 2000s, nearly two dozen African countries proposed de jure land reforms extending access to formal, freehold land tenure to milions of poor households. Many of these reforms stalled. Titled land remains the de facto preserve of wealthy households and, within householsd, men. Beginning in 2010, we tested whether price instruments alone can generate greater inclusion by offering formal titles to residents of a low-income, unplanned settlement in Dar es Salaam at a range of subsidized prices, as well as additional price incentives to include women as owners or co-owners of household land. Estimated price elasticities of demand confirm that prices - rather than other implementation failures or features of the titling regime - are a key obstacle to broader inclusion in the land registry, and that some decree of pro-poor price discrimination is justified even from a narrow budgetary perspective. In terms of gender inequality, we find that even small price incentives for female co-titling achieve almost complete gender parity in land ownership with no reduction in demand. land titling, formalization, gender, field experiment, Tanzania";"Stefan Dercon

"OSF_preprint:46189-D7C-F07";"Making negotiated land reform work : initial experience from Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa";"";"The author describes a new type of negotiated land reform that relies on voluntary land transfers negotiated between buyers and sellers, with the government's role restricted to establishing the necessary framework for negotiation and making a land purchase grant available to eligible beneficiaries. This approach has emerged-following the end of the Cold War and broad macroeconomic adjustment--as many countries face a second generation of reforms to address deep-rooted structural problems and provide a basis for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The author describes initial experiences in Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa. It is too soon to know whether negotiated land reform can rise to the challenges administrative land reform failed to solve but the data so far suggests that: 1) Negotiated land reform can succeed only if measures are taken to make the market for land sales and rentals more fluid transparent. 2) Productive projects are likely to be the key to market-assisted land reform. The potential for project productivity establishes an upper bound on the price to be paid and a basis for financial intermediaries to evaluate the project. It also requires beneficiaries to familiarize themselves with the realities they're likely to confront as independent farmers and the limits to how much land reform can help them achieve their goals. 3) The only way to effectively coordinate the entities involved in the process is through decentralized, demand-driven implementation. 4) The long-run success of land reform depends on getting the private sector involved and using the land purchase grant to""crowd in""private money.

Second, I extend the model to a dynamic setting where demand curves change over time and show that policy can affect price changes in variety of ways, which I refer to as comparative dynamics.

"OSF_preprint:4608A-FC7-AF1";"Fuelwood consumption and participation in community forestry in India";"";"Decentralized forest management is an important policy issue in India and elsewhere. Yet there are few careful studies of the impacts of community forestry. The authors try to fill this gap by analyzing National Sample Survey data from 524 villages in five states in India. Their analysis seeks to answer two key questions: (1) Who participates in community forestry and what are the determinants of participation? (2) What is the impact of participation on household fuelwood consumption? The authors find that proximity to forests, leadership, and fuelwood dependence are significant factors in explaining village participation in community forestry. Household participation is strongly correlated with scarcity, a result that has implications for a recent policy to expand community forestry from degraded to less degraded forests. The authors'most important findings are that fuelwood consumption and participation are linked, and household participation has a significant positive impact on consumption. However, the presence of a village level forestry institution does not have a direct effect.

"OSF_preprint:46189-9B8-0F3";"RURAL POPULATION GROWTH, AGRICULTURAL CHANGE AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: A REVIEW OF HYPOTHESES AND SOME EVIDENCE FROM HONDURAS";"";"This paper reviews hypotheses about the impacts of rural population growth on agriculture and natural resource management in developing countries and the implications for productivity, poverty, and natural resource conditions. Impacts on household and collective decisions are considered, and it is argued that population growth is more likely to have negative impacts when there is no collective responses than when population growth induces infrastructure development, collective action, institutional or organizational development. The impacts of population pressure, particularly on natural resource conditions, may be very different in different contexts, depending on the nature of local markets, institutions, and other factors. Thus careful and comparative empirical work is needed in different contexts before general conclusions can be drawn. There is still a lack of such empirical evidence. The results of one study in central Honduras are used to examine some of the hypotheses presented. The results support neo-Malthusian concerns about the effects of population growth on land degradation, but also provide some support to Boserupian predictions that population pressure will induce adoption of labor-intensive land improvements, collective action to manage natural resources, and organizational development. In general, however, the impacts of population pressure were found to be relatively small and other factors, including infrastructure development and technical assistance programs, had stronger impacts on agricultural change and natural resource management. Although induced innovation theory argues that population pressure may induce such policy responses, we found that these interventions were more likely in less-densely populated communities. This emphasizes that such “induced” policy responses to population pressure do not happen automatically.";"John L.

It begins with the proposition that there are similar land market institutional problems which most ""transition"" countries are facing, due largely to common experiences in creating command economies during the past 50-80 years and the almost simultaneous decisions of these countries to move toward market political economies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Each country has had unique historical experiences, but this paper proposes that there is enough similar institutional history among the transition countries to venture into comparative analysis. In this regard, the Albanian experience with land market institutional development is presented as being potentially relevant to experiences in other transition countries of Europe and the former Soviet Union. The broad question is: How can countries construct the institutions of immovable property markets once they have made the political-economic decision to ""go market""?

"OSF_preprint:46251-73A-A31";"Conflict and Land Tenure in Rwanda";"";"The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the historical relation between conflict and land tenure in Rwanda, a country that experienced a harsh civil war and genocide in the mid-1990s. The victory of the Tutsi-led rebel, Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) at that time triggered a massive return of refugees and a drastic change in land tenure policy. These were refugees who had fled the country at around the time of independence, in 1962, due to the political turmoil and persecution (the “social revolution”) and who shared the background of the core RPF members. The social revolution had dismantled the existent Tutsi-led political order, compelling many Tutsi families to seek refuge outside their homeland. Under the post-independence rule of a Hutu-led government, the Tutsi refugees were not allowed to return and the lands they left behind were often arbitrarily distributed by local authorities among Hutu peasants. After victory in the mid-1990s civil war, the newly established RPF-led government ordered the current inhabitants of the lands to divide the properties in order to allocate portions to the Tutsi returnees. Different patterns of land holding and land division will be explained in the paper from data gathered through the authors’ fieldworks in the southern and eastern parts of Rwanda. Although overt resistance to land division has not been observed to date, the land rights of the Tutsi returnees must be considered unstable because their legitimacy depends primarily on the strength and political stability of the RPF-led government. If the authority of RPF were to weaken, the land rights will be jeopardized. Throughout Rwandan history, in which political exclusion has often led to serious conflict, macro-level politics have repeatedly influenced land holding. Promotion of an inclusive democracy, therefore, is indispensable to escape the vicious circle between political instability and land rights.

Concepts related to travel costs and the production function are frequently applied when the costs of farming distant parcels are examined. However, farmers’ perspective regarding preferences for land use is ignored or partly overlapped by predictions made by researchers. Based on applied econometric models fitted to stated preference data, we revealed that the proximity of a field plot is a relevant factor affecting land-use decisions. One-fourth of landowners would change the use of a field plot if the condition of distance was changed. Landowners would continue farming a field plot if its distance from the farm compound was reduced, being willing to accept on average €79 less in net income per ha per year. The effect of a greater proximity of field plots to the farm compound following land consolidation was heterogeneous, particularly depending on the farm size and its location. land use options, distance factor, land consolidation, choice experiment, multinomial logit model, random parameters model., Land Economics/Use,";"Ioanna Grammatikopoulou

"OSF_preprint:46078-7A2-68D";"Sustainable Land Use and Sustainable Development: Critical Issues";"";"Sustainable agriculture has emerged as a key issue in agricultural development and natural resource management because of widespread and growing concern about the seriousness of degradation of the world's natural resource base and ever-increasing pressures on these resources from continuing rapid population growth. This paper examines the changes in land use and the problem of tropical deforestation affecting the world's land resource base for sustainable agricultural development. Global land-use changes have been slow in the last decade. However, changes in land-use patterns have been significant in many developing countries, especially the conversion of forest land into agricultural land to meet increasing demand for food and fibre. It is estimated that over 11 million ha of tropical forests are cleared every year in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The most serious consequence of tropical deforestation is soil erosion, which may greatly increase after forests are cleared. It is also apparent that tropical deforestation is contributing to global climate change. Improved agricultural sustainability, combined with policies to protect natural resources, is urgently needed to support the rapidly increasing population in developing countries.

The case of Rwanda's nation-wide and relatively low-cost land tenure regularization program is thus of great interest. This paper evaluates the short-term impact (some 2.5 years after completion) of the pilots undertaken to fine-tune the approach using a geographic discontinuity design with spatial fixed effects. Three key findings emerge from the analysis. First, the program improved land access for legally married women (about 76 percent of married couples) and prompted better recordation of inheritance rights without gender bias. Second, the analysis finds a very large impact on investment and maintenance of soil conservation measures. This effect was particularly pronounced for female headed households, suggesting that this group had suffered from high levels of tenure insecurity, which the program managed to reduce. Third, land market activity declined, allowing rejection of the hypothesis that the program caused a wave of distress sales or widespread landlessness by vulnerable people.

It is related to recent controversies about the detrimental impact of land laws on deforestation, which seem to legitimize land encroachments. The latter is mainly the result of land tenure insecurity which is a key characteristic of this region and results from a long history of interactions between rural social unrest and land reforms or land laws. A simple model is developed where strategic interactions between farmers lead to excessive deforestation. One of the empirical implications of the model is a positive relationship between land tenure insecurity and the extent of deforestation. The latter is tested on data from a panel of Brazilian Amazon municipalities. The negative effect of land tenure insecurity proxied by the number of squatters on deforestation is not rejected when estimations are controlled for the possible endogeneity of squatters. One of the main policy implications is that ex post legalizations of settlements must be accompanied by the enforcement of environmental obligations. deforestation;land tenure insecurity;squatters;Panel Data Analysis;Brazil";"Jean-Louis Combes

Carbon farming policies are designed to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, but policy success depends on the participation of land managers and their adoption of alternative land management practices. We surveyed Western Australian farmers to gauge their knowledge of carbon farming, their current adoption of carbon farming practices, and identified the drivers and barriers to adoption. Drivers for adoption included knowledge and perception of co-benefits (for yield, productivity, and the environment); beliefs and attitudes about climate change and its causes. Key barriers to the adopting carbon farming practices included policy and political uncertainty, and on-farm characteristics. We conclude that, to increase participation, the productivity benefits of carbon farming practices must be actively promoted and practices must be easy to integrate into existing farming systems.";"Kerrie A.

"OSF_preprint:4606D-C56-543";"Evolution of Land Conservation Policy";"";"The paper looks at the development of conservation policy since the mid-20th Century. It reviews how land conservation policy developed in the UK, and the ethical and policy design issues which emerged as the focus of conservation expanded. It then considers how the lessons learned may be applied to address environmental conservation needs in developing society situations. The first steps in UK conservation policy entailed legislation to establish public rights over privately owned resources. Other legislation recognized the public interest in the environmental values of the rural environment. The next step was to offer payments to rural land owners and operators not to change use. This assumed that land owners had a right to determine the environmental standard on their land and created a problem of asymmetric information. More positive policies followed to generate additional public goods, raising issues of selection bias, and causing some erosion of property rights as expected standards of environmental management were raised. This led to an extensive literature on policy design to avoid these issues, which will be briefly reviewed. Voluntary conservation initiatives are increasingly being framed as Payments for Environmental Services (PES). PES is heralded as an efficient means to achieve conservation goals. This paper, illustrated with examples from developing areas, addresses advantages and limitations of PES in terms of land conservation policy and warns about limiting policy to utilizing strict PES frameworks due to the complexity of conservation goals, reallocation of property rights, trade-offs between efficiency and distributional issues, uncertainties surrounding additionality of PES and the valuation of conservation benefits and costs.

"OSF_preprint:46156-49F-754";"Agricultural Land Fragmentation and Land Consolidation Rationality";"";"Adopted about one year after the 1989 Revolution, Land Law (Law 18/1991) represented the starting point of land reform in Romania. As a result of this law implementation, at the beginning of the year 2000 the private sector owned 84% of total agricultural land: 82% of arable land, 74% of land under vineyards, 67% of land under orchards and 87% of land under meadows and pastures. Besides the benefic social and economic effects, the mutations produced represent a distortion source in the rural area, determining the following, among others: a) crisis of ownership relations - a main aspect of this being the confusion concerning the ownership rights. The prolongation of clearing up these rights represents a major obstacle to a good operation of land market, to agricultural land consolidation implicitly; b) managerial crisis, manifested by the lack of competitive behaviour, which gives an increased importance to the production function, to the detriment of commercial function; this results in the increased share of small-sized subsistence farms (households), lack of strategic orientations, etc; c) land market crisis - occurred in the context of the lack of legal and institutional framework concerning the land market operation (credits in advantageous conditions for buying land through the banking system or by establishing specialised banks, solving up the problems in connection to using land as collateral for obtaining credits, mortgage credit stimulation); d) crisis of agricultural economic efficiency - mainly generated by land property excessive fragmentation, large area (about 55%) owned by old persons or by persons not having their domicile in the rural area, lack of main production factors combination, limited circulation of land capital, lack of an adequate legal and institutional framework, etc. An analysis of the concrete, social and economic situation of land fragmentation and of agricultural land consolidation opportunity was conducted in the commune Balaciu; this commune is located in the plain area, with a population of 3540 inhabitants and a total area of 8462 ha. In order to identify the rural social actors which can favour land consolidation by their structure, behaviour and functionality, the following typology of rural households has been used as methodology: agricultural households (consisting of persons working only in agriculture); pluriactive households (consisting of persons involved in both agricultural and non-agricultural activities); non-active households (consisting of non-active persons); non-agricultural households (only persons working in other non-agricultural activities). The survey revealed that the main entities which can become the social actors of rural/agricultural modernisation, of land consolidation implicitly are the pluriactive and non-agricultural households. In order to consolidate the agricultural land, there is an obvious and imperative need to conceive a well articulated and coherent framework of support measures, understood and treated as a complex of economic, social, legal and technical measures, aiming at rural community development.

The paper also stresses the importance of more research into who benefits from these competing uses of forest lands, and how these benefits have been distributed within Indonesian society. In conclusion, this paper argues that the underlying causes of deforestation in Indonesia are complex, and cover various aspects of market failure, inappropriate policy implementation in relation to forest management, lack of governance capacity at central and district levels, and other, broader socioeconomic and political issues. forest management, deforestation, plantation, mining, climate change";"Nina L Subiman

"OSF_preprint:460EE-3A2-93B";"Assessing Best-Practice Environmental Management Options at the decision scale: a model for technology choice and policy analysis";"";"Management of environmental externalities of agricultural production has become a necessity to attain sustainable and efficient use of resources. Policies to promote externality mitigation are moving away from command and control toward industry self-management guided through best-practice guidelines and incentive structures. Assessment of such policies thus entails careful examination of options at operational and strategic levels to ensure optimal compliance at least cost. An integrated modelling approach that links activities at a farm and regional scale is outlined in this paper as a tool for technology assessment and policy analysis. Models are developed to address externalities in Australian sugar cane production in a coastal environment, but may be applicable in a wider context in examining ways to enhance greater environmental compliance through best practice management.";"Thilak Mallawaarachchi";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2002-02-01";"en";"land management";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EE-3A2-93B";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

However, to achieve this objective two management issues must be addressed: efficient water use in the face of a looming water scarcity and equity in the sharing of the resource between large-scale investors and smallholder farmers. Focusing on the Office du Niger, one of the largest irrigable areas in Africa this paper compares the performance of three alternative water valuation methods: the currently used flat rate area-based pricing, uniform pricing and increasing block tariffs. Results show the limitations of the current pricing system in economic efficiency and equity terms and in terms of generating sufficient revenue to meet water supply costs. The paper shows that volumetric water pricing avoids these shortcomings and allows the water decision maker to weigh the efficiency-equity trade-offs in irrigation water management.";"Yoro Sidibe

"OSF_preprint:4613D-219-BAB";"Land Distribution and Rice Sufficiency in Northern Laos";"";"Backward agriculture, inadequate farm income and absolute poverty have long characterized the economy of developing countries. Unequal distribution of agricultural land is often cited as a source of poverty and inefficiency in agriculture. However, much of literature on smallholders tends to address income inequality and (total) land size, while land inequality has been overlooked in those discourses. In view of filling the research gap, this paper provides a micro-level foundation for discussions on land inequality and food security in Laos as a case study for least developed countries. Using detailed primary data of farm households from Phongsaly, one of the poorest provinces in northern Laos, the study decomposes agricultural land into three types, namely irrigated lowland, rain-fed lowland and upland, and evaluates the effect of uneven distribution and quality of land on food security. A significant contribution of the paper consists in that land inequality is controlled for and access to agricultural infrastructure is measured by irrigated area. The study reveals that landholdings - regardless of types of land - improve rice self-sufficiency, and that superior land quality - irrigated or rain-fed lowland - enhances food security of farm households. The findings pertain to impact of land policy (allocation, utilization and management of agricultural land) on food security and poverty alleviation. food security, land inequality, Laos";"Phanhpakit Onphanhdala

Renewed interest in land following the economic and political liberalization of the early 1990s spawned land conflicts and exacerbated their severity. This paper, based on fieldwork conducted in 1997-8, explores aspects of this situation, drawing extensively on case-study material. Attention is drawn to the impact on land tenure dynamics of several unique aspects of Guyana's development history, particularly, the country's phased development inward from the coast. Three major tenure sectors are identified, with issues unique to each and common across all of them explored. These include challenges posed by undivided ownership, widespread violations of the law, and vagueness in terms of how rights to land are documented and physically defined through surveys. While an ambitious, wide-ranging set of initiatives embarked upon in 2000 seeks to address many of these problems, it is doubtful that they will dramatically or quickly alter the prevailing state of affairs.

We present a timeline of policies and acts taken by the current federal administration against the environment during the pandemic and discuss their consequences. The unprecedented amount of measures affecting environmental policies is especially intended to weaken deforestation control and transparency of environmental agencies, and allow the expansion of harmful activities (e.g. mining and agribusiness) into Protected Areas and Indigenous Lands. The ongoing environmental dismantling in Brazil breaches several international agreements and, if not reverted, will jeopardize nature’s contributions to national and global societies and risk worldwide climate and biodiversity. We highlight strategies that could be taken by economic, scientific, and political sectors to cease the environmental dismantling in Brazil. The suggestions presented here could also be used in other countries facing similar challenges.";"Raísa Romênia S. Vieira

"OSF_preprint:46139-E02-E2B";"Tropical Land Use Land Cover Mapping in Par\'{a} (Brazil) using Discriminative Markov Random Fields and Multi-temporal TerraSAR-X Data";"";"Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land use land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit information. However, detection of short-term processes and land use patterns of high spatial-temporal variability is a challenging task. We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques, namely Discriminative Markov Random Fields with spatio-temporal priors, and Import Vector Machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Par\'{a} with land cover dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye, Landsat) for reference. Results show that land use land cover is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to $79\%$ in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of different pasture types remain. The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes.";"Björn Waske

"OSF_preprint:4620D-907-E01";"Land Access and Youth Livelihood Opportunities in Southern Ethiopia";"";"This study aims to examine current land access and youth livelihood opportunities in Southern Ethiopia. Access to agricultural land is a constitutional right for rural residents of Ethiopia. We used survey data from the relatively land abundant districts of Oromia Region and from the land scarce districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ (SNNP) Region. We found that youth in the rural south have limited potential to obtain agricultural land that can be a basis for viable livelihood. The law prohibits the purchase and sale of land in Ethiopia. We found that land access through allocation from authorities is virtually nonexistent while land that can be obtained from parents through inheritance or gift is too small to establish a meaningful livelihood. The land rental market has restrictions, including on the number of years land can be rented out. Perhaps as a result of limited land access, the youth have turned their back on agriculture. Our study shows that only nine percent of youth in these rural areas plan to pursue farming. The majority are planning non-agricultural livelihoods. We also found a significant rural -urban migration among the youth and especially in areas with severe agricultural land scarcity. Our econometric analyses show that youth from families with larger land holding are less likely to choose non-agricultural livelihood as well as less likely to migrate to urban areas. We suggest here some measures to improve rural livelihood such as creation of non-farm employment opportunities and improvement of land rental markets. We also argue that as a certain level of rural-urban migration is unavoidable, investigating youth migration is essential to design policies that help the migrating youth as well as the host communities.

"OSF_preprint:4612E-825-18C";"The land market and housing supply in The Netherlands";"";"It is widely accepted that supply of new houses in the Netherlands has become unresponsive to market conditions. Generally, high and rising house prices are related to lack of construction. Insufficient and unrensposive construction is explained by a lack of land made available for house building. In its turn, scarcity of land is believed to be caused by restrictive spatial planning, which aims at keeping land free from development. In this paper, we will try to look at this problem from a fresh angle, namely the actual developments within the land market and land use, especially in the Netherlands. We will show that the amount of land used for urban functions is steadily rising. If spatial planning is aiming to reduce the amount of land for living and working, it is not particularly successful. Most interestingly, the amount of land available for building is now higher than it has been in the past decades. If fact, in 2006 this amount was 73% higher than in 1996. More recent figures are not yet available. In 2006, the amount of land available for building was 16.5% of the total area occupied by residential buildings. In principle, this should allow an increase of house building. Moreover, many new locations realized in the past fifteen years (the so called VINEX locations) have relatively low densities of only 10 houses per hectare. These locations were designated for housebuilding by the central government in 1993. Overall, it regards 240 sites in 57 municipalities with 265,000 houses realized between 1996 and 2007. In a situation of scarcity of land higher densities would have been expected. So, we tend to conclude that, although house building is not reponsive to high and rising prices, restrictive planning and lack of availability of land is not the only or even the most important explanation of stagnant house building. People who are critical about current planning often imply that more houses should be supplied in lower densities on small-scale locations. However, we believe that the most serious shortages are in the biggest cities and their immediate surroundings. In these areas, it is very difficult to increase supply as it involves building on brownfield sites. In the period from 2000 to 2006, already 43% of all new houses were realized in existing built-up areas. Raising the pace of construction in the main cities is only possible in case of large-scale redevelopment of existing urban areas. So far, this has nowhere been practised. In our view, as long as this consequence will be avoided, there will remain a structural shortage of houses in the most favoured cities of the Netherlands, resulting in high prices. Increasing supply at other locations will not succeed in solving this problem. The main mistake of spatial planning in the Netherlands has been that it, largely as from the 1960ís, has limited the growth of the biggest cities in the country.";"H.J. Brouwer

"OSF_preprint:46169-BA4-C21";"Forest Based Industry and Forest Land Management in India";"";"The paper highlights that land degradation in India has been approaching a crisis level in spite of repeated emphasis on wasteland development and existence of apex level organisations for that purpose. One reason has been the policy emphasis on ownership and control rather than appropriate management of the land. It is set in the context of i) the 1988 Forest Policy, and ii) the recent amends to the Forest Conservation Act. The first of these stipulates that forest based industrial units should establish direct contacts with the farmers to obtain the woody raw materials while the second empowers the state governments, with the GOI?s approval, to lease forest land to the industrial and other non-government organizations to raise commercial plantations to meet their raw material needs. Doubts have, therefore, been expressed that the industries would still not be allowed to play a role to develop the forest and non-forest wasteland, and to produce the woody materials for themselves. The reasoning for and against involving wood based industries in this task has been assessed. Based on the welfare economics principles, some measures to minimize the short term conflicts, where relevant, between the industries and the rural people have also been suggested. These should be helpful in arriving at objective resource management decisions within the ambit of the new policy and the acts.";"Gupta Tirath";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2014-01-23";"en";"forest land;land;land management";"Forest Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"AUS;BEL;CAN;IND;IOT;USA";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46169-BA4-C21";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

While they find some support for endogeneity of investment in trees, this is not the case for terraces. Transfer rights are unambiguously investment-enhancing. The large productivity effect of terracing implies that, even where households undertake investments to increase their tenure security, this may not be socially efficient. In Ethiopia, government action to increase tenure security and transferability of land rights can significantly enhance rural investment and productivity.

Many positive changes have taken place since then. and the countryside in postwar Mozambique is in a state of intense transformation. Nevertheless, the government has been largely silent on the issue of land tenure reform, while some of the recommendations regarding land-policy reform that have been proposed are simplistic, uninformed, and fail to reflect the present political reality in Mozambique. This report shows the need to initiate a comprehensive discussion on land policy reform, natural resource management, and decentralized control over resources. The discussion must address fundamental questions about what types of land rights will exist or, more specifically, what types of property rights will be permitted; who will have the power to distribute land rights; and how and by whom land disputes will be settled. At the heart of these questions lie profound issues relating to the role and nature of the state and other political institutions, the relationships of these institutions with the citizens, and the form and nature of governance in Mozambique. In this report we will raise several concerns with regard to land that we hope will help policymakers in Mozambique define the parameters of this discussion. Land Economics/Use,";"Gregory W. Myers

"OSF_preprint:460C9-52A-8E6";"Optimal Contract Length for Voluntary Land Conservation Programs";"";"In many parts of the world, deteriorating environmental conditions have led policy makers to develop policies and programs aimed at promoting conservation practices on lands devoted to agriculture. Such programs have been studied by environmental economists, but little research has been done on the usefulness of strategically varying the conservation contract's length. This paper uses theory and simulation to investigate the optimal contract length of land conservation programs when a policy maker tries to maximize the present discounted value of the stream of environmental benefits from the program. We find that contract length should vary with characteristics of the ecological processes that yield benefits from land retirement. Optimal contracts are longer when the environmental benefits in question things like woodland biodiversity take time to develop. However, it is not typically optimal to have the indefinitelylived contracts favored by some conservation groups, or even to offer contracts as long as the maturation period for the environmental services in question. In general, the optimal contract length depends on the trade off between an ecological effect (increasing the environmental benefits from one farmer) and an enrollment effect (increasing the number of farmers enrolled). Our findings also suggest that non-ecological regional characteristics (such as turnover rate and average farm income) could play an important role in the design of conservation programs.

"OSF_preprint:46019-F85-FB6";"Security of Tenure and Land Registration in Africa: Literature Review and Synthesis";"";"In 1984, the Land Tenure Center embarked on a project to evaluate the experiences with land registration and tenure reform in Africa. The goal was to determine is African states been able to use tenure reform and land registration to provide greater security of tenure than was available through customary tenure systems. Donor agencies focused attention on the creation of individual freehold title, emphasizing the heightened security of holding, marketability, and access to credit under such tenure. National governments, on the other hand, were more concerned to see that land was used productively rather than merely accumulated for purposes of prestige or inheritance or as a hedge against inflation, and for this reason have tended to favor granting more circumscribed rights, such as leaseholds or rights of occupancy. This literature review and synthesis was prepared as part of an effort to increase very substantially our knowledge, especially on a quantitative level, of tenure and development relationships in Africa. The literature review is an attempt to gather in one place data about the diverse efforts at land registration and to describe briefly for each country the various registration programs that have taken place (if any), why they were undertaken, and what subsequent studies of these programs have found. Among other things, it will be seen that the intended benefits, and beneficiaries, of land registration have changed over the century or so since the first systems were put in place. In addition to these variations over time, there are also differences among Anglophone, Francophone, and Lusophone countries, differences that not only influenced the structure of registration systems established during the colonial era, but also continue to inform the kinds of registration systems adopted today.

It provides an easily understandable but theoretically sturdy framework to analyze and communicate on transportation and land-use policies. Based on the linkage of a transportation with an urban model, the project benefits from Cofiroute's experience as regards the transportation model, to focus on the development of an efficient and innovative urban model. PIRANDELLO aims at improving the representation of the housing market, and providing easily communicable results. The former point involves a detailed representation of the structure of households' residential choices. The latter is achieved thanks to a simple but efficient decomposition of the utility function into housing comfort and accessibility of the location. The goal of the paper is twofold: · From a theoretical point of view, to improve the representation of the housing market and thereby address the skepticism of many French decision-makers relating to the ability of LUTI models to represent its specificities. · Secondly, to underline the relevance of this project relatively to the current situation of the Paris metropolitan area, which calls for major land-use and transportation policies in front of the structural lack of housing supply and transportation issues. We notably present the potentialities of PIRANDELLO through a first calibration for this region, and application to the case of an urban toll. land-use transport interaction,urban model,forecast,land-use planning,Paris metropolitan area,Planification territoriale,interaction transport,usage du sol,prévision,modèle urbain,Île-de-France";"Fabien Leurent

Despite its importance, few nationally representative data exist on women’s property rights in Asia, hindering formulation of appropriate policies to reduce gender gaps in land rights. This paper reviews existing micro-level, large sample data on men’s and women’s control of land, using this information to assess gaps in land rights. Utilizing nationally representative individual- and plot-level data from Bangladesh, Tajikistan, Vietnam, and Timor-Leste, we calculate five indicators: incidence of landownership and distribution of landownership by sex, and distribution of plots owned, mean plot size, and distribution of land area, all by sex of owner. The results reveal large gender gaps in landownership across countries. However, the limited information on joint and individual ownership are among the most critical data gaps and are an important area for future data collection and analysis.

The empirical evaluation of the effect of property rights typically suffers from selection problems. The paper addresses the selection issue by exploiting a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. Twenty years ago, a group of squatters occupied a piece of privately owned land in a suburban area of Buenos Aires, Argentina. When the provincial Congress passed an expropriation law transferring the land from the former owners to the squatters, some of the former owners surrendered the land (and received compensation), while others decided to sue in the slow Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an allocation of property rights that is exogenous to the characteristics of the squatters. This paper takes advantage of this natural experiment to evaluate the effect of the allocation of urban land property rights on child health. The results show that children in the titled parcels enjoy better nutrition and lower teenage pregnancy rates than those in the untitled parcels.";"Sebastian Galiani

Using a mixed-integer linear programming model, this study examines the impacts of conservation-oriented community forest policies in Nepal on three household income groups. The results show that current community forest policies, which focus on environmental outcomes through forest use restriction for environment conservation and timber production, result in a large reduction in employment and income of the poorest households and largely explain the recent increase in poverty of rural areas.";"Hugh R.

There have been no other studies that have analyzed power law statistics on land markets up to now. We analyzed a database of the assessed value of land, which is officially monitored and made available to the public by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Government of Japan. This is the largest database of Japan's land prices, and consists of approximately 30,000 points for each year of a 6-year period (1995-2000). By analyzing the data on the assessed value of land, we were able to determine the power law distributions of the land prices and of the relative prices of the land. The data fits to a very good degree the approximation of power law distributions. We also found that the price fluctuations were amplified with the level of the price. These results hold for the data for each of the 6 annual intervals. Our empirical findings present the conditions that any empirically accurate theories of land market must satisfy.

Institutions that govern its use determine the sustainability and efficient use of this essential resource. In Ethiopia all land is publicly owned. Such an institutional setting has resulted in major degradation of Ethiopia’s land resources and dissipation of the resource rent, as available forest and grazing lands are exploited in a suboptimal fashion. An alternative to current institutional setting is to assign private property institution, but this will lead to welfare costs. In this paper, we examine the welfare effects (from consumer perspective) of change in institutional setting to forest and grazing lands using a unique data set covering 200 cross-section households in Tigrai, Northern Ethiopia. Finding suggest that changing the current institutional setting could indeed be welfare reducing. Given the finding, it is little wonder the government is reluctant to impose a private property institution on Ethiopia, despite continued land degradation. institutions, sustainable land use, economic welfare., Environmental Economics and Policy, K11, Q12, Q2, Q28,";"Zenebe Gebreegziabher";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2015-12-10";"en";"grazing;land;land use;sustainable land use";"Land & Investments;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"ETH;NOR";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46006-966-439";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

This paper examines the optimal management of agricultural land through the use of non-crop inputs, such as fertiliser, and land uses that either degrade or restore productivity. We demonstrate the need to consider the relative total asset value of alternative crops over time. It is shown that higher prices for crops that degrade the resource base should motivate the use of short rotations with a remedial phase. An inability of land markets to reflect differences in resource quality and low capital malleability promote greater degradation. However, substitution of complementary effects through input usage may help to sustain productivity. These factors are discussed in the context of crop sequence management in Western Australian cropping systems.

However this phenomenon gains certain particularities and interest when it happens within the current context of climate change policy initiatives and the global land rush. This nexus produces a new set of political processes containing new actors and alliances, legitimizations, and mechanisms of dispossession that set off a different pace for land grabs. This study explores this nexus which has the potential to swiftly reboot spatial, institutional and political land arrangements in poor communities on a large scale, globally. The gap in the scholarly literature found in the disaster – global land rush – climate change nexus was examined from the perspective of a local community devastated by the 2013 super typhoon Haiyan in central Philippines. Using a political economy lens, the study revealed that along with the dynamics of the structural and institutional environment, the interaction between the pro-reform social and state actors determines the nature, pace, extent and trajectory of the land struggle. The ‘state-society interactive’ approach highlights the political agency of both the state and social actors, particularly how they exercise their autonomy and capacity, and maximize channels within and external to the state to advance their claim. How the interplay of different institutions of climate change mitigation, land grabs and disasters interacts with the political processes of current land grabs is the focus of this study. land grabs, climate change, disasters, Philippines, small islands";"M.

The most recent phase, the Fast Track Land Reform Program, was launched in 2000 with the aim of acquiring at least five million hectares of land for redistribution. This paper investigates the impact of this program on perceptions of tenure security and investments in soil conservation. Evidence suggests that the program not only created some insecurity among its beneficiaries but also had an adverse impact on investments in soil conservation. Interestingly, households in the study that believed investing in land enhanced tenure security invested significantly more. Their perceptions of tenure security depended positively on investment levels, supporting the contention that households invest in long-term land-related investments to enhance security of tenure.

Besides, the inward closeness centrality of evil forces is high, manifesting that evil forces independently possess decentralized power of network and have unscrupulous behavior in land requisition and relocation to a certain extent. (ii) Activities of evil forces have complicated spatial correlation and their geographical distribution is uneven, taking on irregular characteristics. In the field of land requisition and relocation, some evil forces are expanding and spreading, while other forces are relatively weak.

Forest products, which are used by the community and which may also be traded, are essential contributors to community well-being. Forests are also important contributors of ecosystem services, such as flood protection and wildlife habitat. Nepalese communities were surveyed to measure flows of forest products from their community forests. A stochastic frontier analysis shows that communities are not producing forest products efficiently and there is potential for improvement. The results shows that forest products benefit and environmental performance are associated products. In addition, analysis reveals that factors such as social capital, support from government and knowledge in management contributes positively to the production efficiency. It is anticipated that these findings will contribute to community forest policy redesign and consequently to the welfare of communities.";"Narendra Chand

"OSF_preprint:46007-ABB-80D";"Understanding determinants of farmers’ investments in, and impacts of, soil and water conservation in Ethiopia: review and synthesis [Abstract only]";"";"Although there has been a considerable effort to reduce soil erosion and improve land productivity in Ethiopia, farmers’ investments in SWC remain limited. There is a long and rich tradition of empirical research that seeks to identify the determinants that affect farmers’ investments in SWC practices. Nevertheless, the results regarding these determinants have been inconsistent and scattered. Moreover, the impacts of different SWC practices have not been reviewed and synthesized. Thus, this paper reviews and synthesizes past research in order to dentify determinants that affect farmers’ investments in SWC practices, and to also assess the impact of SWC practices within the framework of ecosystem services, particularly in relation to provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. The review identified several determinants that affect farmers’ investments in SWC practices, which are categorized into two groups: (i) factors that are related to farmers’ capacity to invest in SWC practices, and (ii) farmers’ incentives to invest in such practices. Farmers’ investments in SWC are limited by both the capacity to invest and incentives from their investments related to land improvement. The review also showed that farmers’ capacities to invest in SWC practices and their incentives for making such investments have been influenced by external factors, such as institutional support and policies. This suggests that creating enabling conditions for enhancing farmers’ investment capacities in SWC practices, and increasing their incentives for making such investments, is crucial. The review and synthesis showed that the impact of most SWC practices on provisioning ecosystem services (e.g., crop yield) is negative, which is mainly due to the reduction of effective cultivable area due to soil/stone bunds. However, these practices were very effective in regulating ecosystem services, such as soil erosion control, soil fertility improvement and surface runoff reduction.";"Simon Langan

"OSF_preprint:46075-C1B-983";"Foreign Land Deals in Africa: Implications for Agricultural Trade";"";"This study investigates the implications of foreign land deals in Africa especially with regard to agricultural trade. It is motivated essentially by large scale foreign deals of land in Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Southeast Asia that have been reported in recent years. One of the driving forces has been attributed to the presumed availability of land in these regions. This study employs data sourced from World Development Indicators and World Governance Indicators on key variables such as arable land per person, agricultural land as percentage of land area, net food import, regulatory quality, among others (1995-2010) on selected African countries where instances of foreign land deals have been reported. The study formulates empirical models that draw from institutional development theory, which is estimated using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The study found LSFLDs to impact negatively on agricultural export in selected countries, the indexes of institutional framework used were found to be significant; likewise, agricultural land becomes highly significant with relative larger magnitude when interacted with institutional indexes. This therefore implies that as more agricultural land is acquired, agricultural export tends to dwindle and incidences of food insecurity are heightened. The preliminary investigation suggests the need for controlling the issue of massive foreign land deals through viable institutional framework, which can be engendered by building sound legal and procedural measures that will protect local rights and take into account the aspirations of local farmers and the welfare of citizenry.

By the weighted average synthesis algorithm, we calculate the evaluation indicators and finally summarize the overall evaluation results for comprehensive evaluation.

Ultimately, the case raises questions about the ethics of intervention. When governments want approximately the rules of the game suggested by donors (functioning institutions to facilitate markets) but do not want a level playing field, how should this be understood and resolved?

Several tools, such as the Rural Land Plans (PFRs) used in Benin, seem to resolve the tension between the logic of registering rights in order to increase productivity and the logic of securing complex local rights and reducing conflict. But while PFRs are potentially a good tool for dealing with complexity, current policy debate in Benin tends to focus on them as a tool for privatisation. But given the diversity of local situations and complexity of land rights, a single model of private property will inevitably engender exclusion and conflict, for questionable economic benefits.

This result does not disappear when a large set of potential confounding factors are included in the analysis. The use of the Reconquest as a quasi-natural experiment allows us to rule out further concerns about potential endogeneity. Likewise, by employing data on schooling enrolment rates and number of teachers, this paper explores the mechanisms behind the observed relationship in order to ascertain to which extent demand or supply factors are responsible for it.

Exploiting periods of high and low appreciation that caused different increases in wealth for farmers owning different shares of their farmland, we examine if U.S. grain farmers expanded their acres harvested or acres owned in response to an increase in their land wealth. We find that land wealth had little effect on farm size. However, for farms of a similar size, owning 10 percentage points more land increased the growth rate of land owned by 2 percentage points. Because older farmers own a larger share of the land in the farm, an increase in the rate of land appreciation slows the rate at which younger farmers acquire land relative to older farmers.";"Jeremy G.

This methodology allows a richer typology than traditionnally used in empiric literature, and distinguishes between various loans that are not always free. The empiricalresults show that land loans are frequently chosen by households who rely heavily on traditional risk-sharing networks and credit land with a high safety net value. Morevore, the statistical analysis reveal the significance of hybrid transfers such as disguised rental, that combine both rent-seeking and risk-coping motivations.

"OSF_preprint:461CA-CE6-7E4";"Demand-Side Factors in Optimal Land Conservation Choice";"";"The dominant paradigm of conservation-reserve planning in economics is to optimize the provision of physical conservation benefits (measured in units like species protected) given a budget constraint. Large-scale biology-based priority setting implies that the value we place on biodiversity and ecosystem function is not affected by human proximity to that natural capital. There is significant evidence, however, that human willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation declines with distance (e.g. Loomis 2000) – a phenomenon we refer to as “spatial value decay”. This paper begins a new strand of the conservation planning literature that takes demand-side factors – the location of people in the landscape and the degree to which their willingness to pay for an environmental amenity depends on proximity to that amenity – into account. We use theoretical models of linear abstract landscapes to explore the impact of demand-side factors on two facets of optimal conservation choices: siting of a single reserve when conservation value is greatest near a critical site in the landscape (optimal targeting), and siting of multiple reserves when fragmentation reduces physical conservation services produced (optimal agglomeration). Our results show how optimal conservation planning might differ from straight ecological prescriptions. While minimum fragmentation is often optimal, planners can usefully employ increased fragmentation to capture value when people’s preferences are not very highly localized. In a targeting problem, the ecologically critical site is often the right thing to protect, but optimal policy balances proximity to critical site with proximity to people. In some scenarios, the payoff to using a reserve design approach that considers demand-side factors is large. Finally, we find that spatial value decay reduces the maximum levels of welfare and environmental services that can be gained from any conservation-planning approach. When spatial value decay is present because people are simply unaware of environmental resources farther away from where they live, education campaigns might serve to increase social welfare and environmental services. conservation, endangered species, optimal reserve-site selection, spatial, demand-side, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q24, Q57,";"Amy Whritenour Ando

So far, economists have mostly abstained from this debate.

Arguably, foreign investors are then assumed to be able to utilize arable, but mostly idle land more efficiently than locals (cf., e.g., Deininger/Byerlee, 2011). At the same time, critics (mostly from other disciplines) claim that these very land deals have highly detrimental effects on local populations, especially smallholders, as neither governments nor international investors typically care much about these people’s interests and do not honor their often informal land-use rights (cf., e.g., Cotula, 2011).

"OSF_preprint:4615B-89A-20D";"Land Consolidation Design Based on an Evaluation of Ecological Sensitivity";"";"Land consolidation engineering inevitably interferes with terrestrial ecosystems, leading to natural capital loss. Therefore, conducting an ecological sensitivity evaluation of a project area before consolidation engineering is very important for reducing unnecessary human interference. Conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and the biodiversity therein to the greatest possible extent is urgently needed. This research analyzes the interference by human activities caused by land consolidation engineering in terrestrial ecosystems. GIS technology, ecological values, landscape pattern indexes, and an ecological risk evaluation were used to construct an ecological sensitivity evaluation index. The coefficient of variation method and a comprehensive sensitivity rating evaluation were used to calculate the weights and results. The project area was divided into sensitivity zones according to the results, and the results and suggestions are as follows: In the highly eco-sensitive zone, where bare rocks, gravel, and grass-covered areas compose the main landscape type, vegetation should be restored, and forests should be planted. In the medium eco-sensitivity zone, where irrigated paddy fields and arid land compose the main landscape type, land parcels should be merged, and agricultural infrastructure should be constructed or improved. In the low eco-sensitivity zone, where forests compose the main landscape type, roads should be closed, natural habitat should be restored, and buffer zones should be created. This study provides suggestions for future land management decisions.";"Zhang Qiuqin

Three issues are analyzed: the first is the available evidence on the so called “land grab” and the associated question of the role of control on land in the internationalisation of developing countries agricultural production. The focus is on multinational enterprises in agriculture, although analysis of shifting FDI strategies requires value chain considerations. The second issue is the problem of the risks of such large land deals in the context of complex and insecure land rights. The third is the possible role of corporate social responsibility and of a model code of conduct promoted by international organisations in mitigating such risks.";"Nadia Cuffaro

Households are homogeneous in terms of utility and gross income, but each household chooses its residential location on the basis of its place of employment, which is deemed to be fixed. Equilibrium conditions for this residential location market are established. It is shown that there is an equilibrium that is unique (for a closed city with absentee landlords). Households' utility and dwelling size increase the farther the workplace is from the centre, whereas land rent decreases. Within a simplified framework, the model is resolved analytically and we establish the sensitivity of the endogenous variables to the city's characteristic parameters. Two extreme cases are highlighted: the “quasi-monocentric” city where net income decreases with distance from the centre, versus the “eccentric” city, where net income increases with distance from the centre.

"OSF_preprint:461DA-557-B7C";"Microsimulation of urban land use";"";"The project ILUMASS (Integrated Land-Use Modelling and Transportation System Simulation) aims at embedding a microscopic dynamic simulation model of urban traffic flows into a comprehensive model system incorporating both changes of land use and the resulting changes in transport demand. The land-use component of ILUMASS will be based on the land-use parts of an existing urban simulation model, but is to be microscopic like the transport parts of ILUMASS. Microsimulation modules will include models of demographic development, household formation, firm lifecycles, residential and non-residential construction, labour mobility on the regional labour market and household mobility on the regional housing market. These modules will be closely linked with the models of daily activity patterns and travel and goods movements modelled in the transport parts of ILUMASS developed by other partners of the project team. The design of the land use model takes into account that the collection of individual micro data (i.e. data which because of their micro location can be associated with individual buildings or small groups of buildings) or the retrieval of individual micro data from administrative registers for planning purposes is neither possible nor, for privacy reasons, desirable. The land use model therefore works with synthetic micro data which can be retrieved from generally accessible public data. ILUMASS is a group project of institutes of the universities of Aachen, Bamberg, Dortmund, Cologne and Wuppertal under the co-ordination of the Transport Research Institute of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). Study region for tests and first applications of the model is the urban region of Dortmund. The common database will be compiled in co-operation with the City of Dortmund. After its completion the integrated model is to be used for assessing the impacts of potential transport and land use policies for the new land use plan of the city. The paper will focus on the land-use parts of the ILUMASS model. It will present the underlying behavioural theories and how they are made operational in the model design, explain how the synthetic population is generated, show first model results and demonstrate the potential usefulness of the model for the planning process.";"Rolf Moeckel

Based on a distinct feature of the interaction between formal law and customary rights in Madagascar, this paper augments the canonical model of share tenancy by making the strength of the landlord’s property right increasing in the amount of risk she chooses to bear within the contract. Sharecropping may thus emerge as the optimal contract even when the tenant is risk-neutral. Using data on landlords’ subjective perceptions of tenurial insecurity in a rural area of Madagascar, empirical tests strongly support the hypothesis that insecure property rights drive contract choice while offering little support in favor of the canonical hypothesis that risk sharing considerations drive contract choice.

"OSF_preprint:46043-C89-0E1";"Are There Gender Differences in the Perceived Impact of Land Security? Evidence from Urban Lesotho";"";"As part of the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Agreement, the Government of Lesotho has implemented an institutional strengthening and land regularization project in the urban and peri-urban areas of the capital city Maseru. The main objective of this project is to strengthen the rights of the legitimate occupiers of the land by a process of formalizing those rights. This formalization process of the rights to land is expected to promote private sector development and stimulate economic growth. The Compact Agreement has also supported training and public awareness to promote increased understanding and acceptance of gender equality and to ensure equal access by women to economic resources and opportunities. This paper explores gender differences in the perceived effects of securing land rights on behavioral outcomes related to household participation in land market and economic investments. It presents descriptive and analytical results of a cross-sectional data based on a household survey conducted in 2013 in four northern municipal councils of greater Maseru. Preliminary results indicate that on many indicators of perceived effect of secured land rights, there are no gender differences. Econometrics analysis to identify factors that determine different behavioral outcomes in terms of market participation and land investment is further explored.";"Songqing Jin

Our estimates suggest that land availability, abundance of water resources and weak land governance are significant determinants of large-scale land acquisitions for biofuel production. This in turn suggests that this type of investment is mainly resource-seeking and investors might see land governance weaknesses as a way to access land and water resources at very favorable conditions.

"OSF_preprint:4603B-CE5-60E";"AN ANALYSIS OF LAND DISTRIBUTION AND CONCENTRATION IN BOLIVIA";"";"Despite the implementation of Bolivia's land reform in 1953, the agrarian structure continues to have an extreme concentration of land. Furthermore, in the last two decades regional agrarian structure have been aggravated by population pressures and a lack of new technological practices for most small scale farmers and peasants. Public and private institutions and urban residents observe hundreds of landless and near-landless families in the cities searching for jobs. Most end up becoming part of the growing unemployed labor force in the urban sector. The lack of industrialization policies to create job opportunities for the rural population and the explosive population growth in some rural area has contributed to the increasing levels of poverty among Bolivia's peasantry. Since a considerable proportion of the population increase must be absorbed by the agricultural sector, this has had a disadvantageous effect on those who are dependent on agriculture. Meanwhile, biased distribution of land has contributed to a reduction in the size of the land holding of most peasants in the subsistence or traditional sector. Many land holding are becoming smaller, sometimes leading to small scattered strips, while in other areas there is a gradual depletion of soil fertility due to exhaustive methods of production. It is believed that the demographic pressure is increasing so much that farming methods employed are causing environmental deterioration, such as soil exhaustation and erosion, with all the attendant effects on production. This land fragmentation has led to significant decreases in income of most family production units. At the same time, tenure conditions are becoming less favorable for small farmers and peasants, since landowners are placed in a stronger position relative to the peasants. Furthermore, agricultural land prices in the lowlands and new frontiers have been increasing, which makes land more attractive for capitalists to buy as investments. With the difficult access to land, the high population growth rates in some areas, and the extreme concentration of land, Bolivian peasants are unable to make a living on their own and are forced to find employment as farm or urban laborers. As a result, wages have stagnated or even fallen through the years, while unemployment has risen dramatically. While Bolivia has experiences a radical and highly publicized land reform, in the last four decades old inequalities and insecurities are reappearing. The family smallholding system with private ownership has led to intense subdivision and fragmentation of land in the highlands and valleys. Furthermore, yields of most cash crops are low in comparison to other Latin American countries. Research and extension have been practically nonexistent throughout the last two decades. Credit has been highly subsidized and concentrated among large scale enterprises. Substitution of illegal crops (coca leaves) has been increasing due to the lack of labor opportunities and agricultural incentives. Peasants are being pushed off their land in some prominent agricultural areas by large scale farmers, irrespective of the land markets and agrarian laws. Under these conditions, poverty among Bolivia's peasantry continues due to the lack of coordinated development strategies in the agricultural sector. Two of the leading causes of this rural poverty is the lack of access to sufficient land for the peasantry and land distribution patterns that have arisen in the last two decades. Therefore, studies of land concentration, which has a direct relationship with the distribution of wealth in the rural economy, must be a priority in order to develop the sector.

"OSF_preprint:46244-97B-F74";"LARGE SCALE LAND INVESTMENTS AND FORESTS IN AFRICA";"";"Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in land-based investments for food, feed, fuel and fiber, driven by volatility in commodity prices, economic growth of emerging economies, policy drivers of biofuel demand and investor strategies in the wake of the global economic crisis. This has led to a surge of foreign and local investments in developing countries, where land can be obtained at lower cost, and has led to fears of land grabbing. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying the determinants of large scale land acquisitions in Africa, and employ unilateral beta regression to explore the link between investments and a number of indicators related both to land supply and to institutional features. The results on the resource seeking nature of investments and on the impact of the land governance indicators are mostly in line with the findings of other studies; on the contrary, the results on forest land being a driver for large scale land acquisitions in Africa differ from previous findings, and indicate commercial pressure on African forests that may lead to accelerating degradation and deforestation. beta regression, foreign direct investments, land grabbing, large scale land acquisitions";"Giovanna D'Agostino

"OSF_preprint:46116-4B0-7B2";"""Land grabbing"" by foreign investors in developing countries: Risks and opportunities";"";"""One of the lingering effects of the food price crisis of 2007–08 on the world food system is the proliferating acquisition of farmland in developing countries by other countries seeking to ensure their food supplies. Increased pressures on natural resources, water scarcity, export restrictions imposed by major producers when food prices were high, and growing distrust in the functioning of regional and global markets have pushed countries short in land and water to find alternative means of producing food. These land acquisitions have the potential to inject much-needed investment into agriculture and rural areas in poor developing countries, but they also raise concerns about the impacts on poor local people, who risk losing access to and control over land on which they depend. It is crucial to ensure that these land deals, and the environment within which they take place, are designed in ways that will reduce the threats and facilitate the opportunities for all parties involved."" from Author's text Developing countries, Land grabbing, Food prices,";"Joachim Von Braun

"OSF_preprint:46131-99C-754";"Economic and Environmental Perspectives on Sustainable Agriculture Developments";"";"There is a great deal of concern today to ensure that economic development, including agricultural development, is sustainable. It is being increasingly emphasized that this sustainability requires care to be taken of the natural environment. This is because the natural environment is both the source of important resources that support economic activity and an avenue or sink for disposal of wastes from economic activity. Soil and water are for example, important natural resources used in agricultural production. However, other natural resources used in agriculture include the raw materials from which many fertilisers are produced, fossil fuels and so on. In addition, wild cultars and relatives of cultivated plants and domesticated livestock provide a genetic reservoir that may be very useful in sustaining agricultural production. If attention is not paid to the sustainability of economic production, future generations may be impoverished and even present generations may experience a future drop in their incomes. For example, this result clearly follows when land management or its use results in a rapid rate of soil erosion and loss of the valuable topsoil.";"Clem Tisdell";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"1995-09-01";"en";"agricultural land management;land management;sustainable land management";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"001";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46131-99C-754";"";"";"";"";"";"";""
"OSF_preprint:460DE-29A-043";"Small forests, big ambitions and a hard reality - Community Forestry in Nepal";"";"Community forestry in Nepal is intended to reduce poverty by sustainable management of forests. Timber is one of the most high-value forest products, especially in the case of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the Terai region of Nepal. Despite having several advantages, including high value forests on fertile land, connection with transportation networks, and being close to regional markets, community forests in the Terai region produce little or no timber from their Sal forests. This research looks at what is affecting the production of Sal timber from community forests. Three aspects of community forest user groups (CFUG) are examined using institutional economics, transaction cost economics and micro-economics. First, the scale of CFUG operations is examined in terms of their ability to profitably carry out logging and organise market sales. Second, the capacity of CFUGs to carry out logging in terms of internal physical and human resources, and property rights is examined. Finally, barriers to vertical integration with the market in terms of contracting and cooperation with other CFUGs are investigated. To answer these questions, data was collected from 85 CFUGs and interviews were carried out with 39 key respondents from CFUGs, government agencies, and private firms. The results show that the size of the forest was not an issue for harvesting and marketing logs. However, the organisational capacity of CFUGs was found to be weak because of a lack of financial resources, limited property rights over timber, control over decisions by the District Forest Office, policy constraints, and corruption. In terms of vertical integration, a lack of legal rights to enter into contracts, a high degree of uncertainty about policy and property rights, small and irregular amounts timber harvest, and the interpretation of CFUG rules by the District Forest Office were found to be barriers for the formation of long-term contracts between CFUGs and private firms, and of cooperative developments between CFUGs.";"Chandra Rai

"OSF_preprint:46173-E03-2E8";"Land governance of suburban areas of Vietnam: Dynamics and contestations of planning, housing and the environment";"";"After the Doi Moi (â€˜renovationâ€™) reforms in Vietnam from 1986, land ownership rules were adjusted, effectively terminating former land collectivisation efforts. While land ownership remained fully under the control of the state, a 1993 land law conferred 20-year leaseholds to most farmers. They could now utilize farm land individually, and sell, swap and mortgage the land in a situation similar to private ownership. These leaseholds are now expiring and a new 2013 land law is in the making. This paper was initially written for UNDP Vietnam which supports Vietnam to help formulate a strong new land law, and brings out the complexities of land governance in the suburban areas of fast expanding Vietnamese cities. It first considers the present and changing land use of suburban areas and the key stakeholders involved here â€“ powerful State Owned Enterprises, farmers, bureaucrats and communist party leaders. Planning practices are then assessed â€“ and seen to be both rigid and complex, with different departments at various levels working at cross purposes under conditions of conflicting rules, laws and weak capacities. This is one reason for the dominance of informal arrangements and widespread corruption, where powerful actors benefit hugely and illegally from conditions of opacity and informal networks. Overall outcomes are that cities expand in a haphazard (â€˜leapfrogâ€™) and inefficient manner, with insufficient attention for timely and adequate infrastructure, the environment and for peopleâ€™s welfare as in social amenities and parks. As a result of lopsided incentive systems, it is the state which foregoes huge incomes and faces more costly investments, while many suburban farmers are affected through (arbitrary) land acquisition and inadequate compensation. planning;Vietnam;environment;urban housing;land governance;suburban land";"J.W.

Sales restrictions are found to have little effect on credit supply and demand or demand for land improvements. Some household characteristics are found to affect investment demand on plots subject to sales restrictions in one village, suggesting that the 'transactions effect' of such restrictions may be inhibiting allocative efficiency. However, we also find that household characteristics influence investment on titled plots, and that the magnitude of impact of such characteristics is greater on titled plots. These results imply that sales restrictions are not a major source of inefficiency in the villages studied, and suggest that the nature of village credit and land markets and enforcement of sales restrictions are critical determinants of the impacts of such restrictions.

Tracing rural-rural migration patterns, we find that communities that receive/host more immigrants (and thus have many coexisting tribes) tend to have more land conflicts than those sending migrants out. Unbundling conflicts by type reveals that the number of tribes and being in a ‘receiving’ community are associated with a higher probability of eviction conflicts than ‘sending’ communities and those with fewer tribes. Turning to conflict impact, we find that plots with conflicts have 17% lower yield than those without conflicts. Moreover, breaking down conflicts by type reveals that plots with eviction conflicts have 36% lower yield than those with inheritance conflicts. Our results suggest that rural-rural migration weakens community-specific informal land arrangements and conflict resolution mechanisms, which, in the absence of formal institutions, result in eviction conflicts that, in turn, hurt productivity.";"Francis Mwesigye

"OSF_preprint:4616B-470-B51";"SPATIAL TARGETING STRATEGIES FOR LAND CONSERVATION";"";"Purchasing development rights is a major mechanism for the protection of environmental quality and landscape amenities. This paper provides a targeting strategy for protecting multiple environmental benefits that takes into account land costs and probability of land use conversion. We compare two strategies. Subject to a budget constraint on parcel purchases, the standard strategy is to target parcels with the highest ratio of environmental benefits to land costs. The standard strategy selects parcels even if there is little probability that the parcel would otherwise be converted. Our new strategy targets parcels to minimize the benefit loss from land conversion, which weights parcel based on initial benefit endowment and expected probability of land use conversion. The empirical analysis focuses on targeting conservation easements in the exurban region of Sonoma County, CA, in which extensively-managed, developable parcels (i.e. pasture and forest areas) with environmental benefits are being converted to residential use and vineyards. Spatially-explicit modeling approaches are employed to estimate land values and likelihood of land use conversion, according to heterogeneous parcel site characteristics, for all developable parcels. Our results indicate that benefit-cost targeting is biased toward low cost parcels, since it ignores the variation in likelihood of future land use conversion. This inefficiency for benefit-cost targeting arises from the positive relationship that typically exists between likelihood of land use change and value of development rights. Hence, some parcels with poor land quality or remote accessibility to urban centers would have de facto conservation, and therefore do not warrant targeting of conservation funds, despite the low cost of protection. Our new targeting strategy balances the countervailing factors of land values and likelihood of land use conversion. Land Economics/Use,";"Adina Merenlender

Conservation covenants on private land may represent a cost-effective alternative to land purchase, although many questions on the long-term monitoring and enforcement costs of covenants and the risk of violation or legal challenges remain unquantified. We explore the cost-effectiveness of conservation covenants, defined here as the fraction of the high-biodiversity landscape potentially protected via investment in covenants versus land purchase. We show that covenant violation and dispute rates substantially affect the estimated long-term cost-effectiveness of a covenant versus land purchase strategy. Our results suggest the long-term cost-effectiveness of conservation covenants may outperform land purchase as a strategy to protect biodiversity as long as disputes and legal challenges are low, but point to a critical need for monitoring data to reduce uncertainty and maximize conservation investment cost-effectiveness.";"Richard Schuster

This Agreement allows First Nations to opt out of the 34 land code provisions of the Indian Act and develop individual land codes, and has been promoted as a means of increasing First Nation autonomy and facilitating economic growth and development on reserve lands. This paper is the first to empirically examine factors that may influence a First Nation’s decision to become signatory to the Framework Agreement. There are currently 77 First Nation signatories to the Agreement, 39 with operational independent land codes. A unique dataset characterizing each First Nation by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics is used with a probit model to determine the effects of these characteristics on the probability of First Nation adoption of the Agreement. The results of this study indicate that proximity to an urban centre positively affects the probability that a First Nation will adopt. This finding is consistent with the idea that urban proximity is associated with increased economic opportunities, and that First Nations close to urban centres may adopt the Framework Agreement to gain greater control over their reserve land in an attempt to capture these opportunities.";"Mary Doidge

One reason has been the policy emphasis on ownership and control rather than appropriate management of the land. It is set in the context of i) the 1988 Forest Policy, and ii) the recent amends to the Forest Conservation Act. The first of these stipulates that forest based industrial units should establish direct contacts with the farmers to obtain the woody raw materials while the second empowers the state governments, with the GOIâ€™s approval, to lease forest land to the industrial and other non-government organizations to raise commercial plantations to meet their raw material needs. Doubts have, therefore, been expressed that the industries would still not be allowed to play a role to develop the forest and non-forest wasteland, and to produce the woody materials for themselves. The reasoning for and against involving wood based industries in this task has been assessed. Based on the welfare economics principles, some measures to minimize the short term conflicts, where relevant, between the industries and the rural people have also been suggested. These should be helpful in arriving at objective resource management decisions within the ambit of the new policy and the acts.";"Gupta Tirath";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2015-05-21";"en";"forest land;land;land management";"Forest Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"AUS;BEL;CAN;IND;IOT;USA";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-00F-9BE";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

To examine this relationship we have created a new measure of land distribution within countries that builds upon the work of Deininger and Squire (1998) by explicitly accounting for landlessness. In addition to being a significant predictor of financial development, land inequality is found to be uncorrelated with other fundamental characteristics of economies, suggesting its possible use in a wider range of research.

A 20-year historical timeline (1975-1995) is constructed for the village of La Lima in central Honduras, based on a random sample of 97 plots. Changes in land use are examined using transition analysis and multinomial logit analysis. Transition analysis shows that land use transitions were relatively infrequent in areas under extensive cultivation, but more so in areas of intensive cultivation; and that most changes favored intensification. Econometric analysis suggests that land use intensification was influenced by plot level variables (especially altitude, slope, distance to a road and tenure), farm level variables (human capital, farm size, and ownership of productive implements), and by community variables (especially presence of technical assistance programs). To the extent these results are found to be more broadly representative, they suggest that there may be good potential to promote income-enhancing horticultural development through investments in technical assistance and education in similar communities elsewhere in Honduras. The study concludes that the plot history approach is a potentially valuable tool for investigating the underlying causes of change in land use at the micro-level. The method is particularly well adapted to situations where the availability of data is poor. It is also suggested that the approach would have additional benefits when replicated over a large number of sites as this would allow integration of higher order determinants (e.g. national policies and market incentives) while expanding the applicability and representativity of findings.";"John L.

"OSF_preprint:461D4-F57-01F";"Land Use Change in Indonesia";"";"With an estimated loss of up to 20 million ha of forest over the past decade, deforestation in Indonesia has come to the forefront of global environmental concerns. Indonesia is one of the most important areas of tropical forests worldwide. In addition to providing a multitude of benefits locally, including both products and services, these forests are also of global importance because of their biodiversity and the carbon they sequester. Despite the benefits they provide, Indonesia’s forests have been under considerable threat in past decades, and the extent of forest cover has declined considerably. This paper takes advantage of new data on the extent and distribution of forest cover change in Indonesia to examine its causes and effects. The paper begins by summarizing the long-term trends in land use change in Indonesia, and the new data on loss of forest cover during the period 1985-1997. It then discusses why this land use change is likely to be undesirable in many cases. Land use change can at times be beneficial, but there are good reasons to believe that current patterns of land use change in Indonesia are in fact socially sub-optimal. The paper then reviews the incentives faced by the major actors in land use change—loggers, estate crop producers, and smallholders—and the reasons their decisions concerning land use change, while privately optimal, are likely to be socially sub-optimal. It also briefly examines the effect that the East Asian financial crisis has had on these incentives. Particular attention is paid to mangrove forests, because of their important ecological role.

"OSF_preprint:46109-030-BD5";"Effects of Land Use Planning in PERPRES 54/2008 on River Discharges";"";"In 2008, a presidential regulation number 54 (Peraturan Presiden Nomor 54 Tahun 2008 - Perpres 54/2008) that regulates uses of land for various degrees of utilization and conservation across Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi, Puncak and Cianjur (Jabodetabekpuncur) was issued. Perpres 54/2008 is a reference for the implementation of development related to water and soil conservation, the availability of ground water and surface water, flood prevention, and economic development for the welfare of the community. This study was intended to investigate the effects of land use planning in Perpres 54/2008 on river discharges based on spatial simulation of the Ciliwung and Cisadane watersheds. Three evaluation points for each watershed were investigated: downstream, middle and upper watersheds. Here, we simulated the river discharge at 100m×100m resolution with land use data in year 2007. A calibrated spatial water balance model named Spatial Tools for River Basins and Environment and Analysis of Management Option (STREAM) was used for river discharge simulation. The inputs of this model were climate data (precipitation and temperature), land use and topography. Two scenarios of land use were used, the actual land use condition (i.e. year 2007) and planned land use according to Perpres 54/2008. Based on Perpres 54/2008 simulation scenario, if land use planned in Perpres 54/2008 have successfully implemented, it can reduces river discharge by 0.1% to 5.6%.";"Miga Magenika Julian

"OSF_preprint:4624F-F58-5D3";"Ocean grabbing";"";"The term “ocean grabbing” has been used to describe actions, policies or initiatives that deprive small-scale fishers of resources, dispossess vulnerable populations of coastal lands, and/or undermine historical access to areas of the sea. Rights and access to marine resources and spaces are frequently reallocated through government or private sector initiatives to achieve conservation, management or development objectives with a variety of outcomes for different sectors of society. This paper provides a definition and gives examples of reallocations of marine resources or spaces that might constitute “ocean grabbing”. It offers a tentative framework for evaluating whether marine conservation, management or development is ocean grabbing and proposes an agenda for future research. For a reallocation to be considered ocean grabbing, it must: (1) occur by means of inadequate governance, and (2) be implemented using actions that undermine human security and livelihoods, or (3) produce impacts that reduce social–ecological well-being. Future research on ocean grabbing will: document case studies, drivers and consequences; conduct spatial and historical analyses; and investigate solutions. The intent is to stimulate rigorous discussion and promote systematic inquiry into the phenomenon of ocean grabbing.";"Terre Satterfield

"OSF_preprint:461AE-E40-734";"Bioenergy and Global Land Use Change";"";"This is the first paper that estimates the global land use change impact of growth of the bioenergy sector. Applying time-series analytical mechanisms to fuel, biofuel and agricultural commodity prices and production, we estimate the long-rung relationship between energy prices, bioenergy production and the global land use change. Our results suggest that rising energy prices and bioenergy production significantly contribute to the global land use change both through the direct and indirect land use change impact. Globally, the total agricultural area yearly increases by 35578.1 thousand ha due to increasing oil price, and by 12125.1 thousand ha due to increasing biofuel production, which corresponds to 0.73% and 0.25% of the total world-wide agricultural area, respectively. Soya land use change and wheat land use change have the highest elasticities both with respect to oil price and biofuel production. In contrast, non-biomass crops (grassland and rice) have negative land use change elasticities. Region-specific results suggest that South America faces the largest yearly total land use change associated with oil price increase (+10600.7 thousand ha), whereas Asia (+8918.6 thousand ha), South America (+4024.9 thousand ha) and North America (+1311.5 thousand ha) have the largest yearly total land use change associated with increase in biofuel production.

"OSF_preprint:460DA-F9E-8E8";"Quo Vadis, Indonesian Agrarian Reform?";"";"Law Number 5 of 1960 concerning Basic Regulations on Agrarian Principles is widely praised as the great work of the Indonesian nation which is revolutionary, responsive and combines the undeniable combination of individualism and communalism. However, the achievement of these laws is not achieved and spending is more likely to fail due to normative and ideological reasons. This paper tries to bring the study of the law to a more empirical direction by using theories of public policy implementation. This qualitative research method focuses on executive policy, bureaucrats' actions and the interactions that surround them. The study found that the executive policy with the issuance of Presidential Regulation Number 86 of 2018 was precisely not in line with several provisions of Law Number 5 of 1960. The presidential regulation has a paradox, wants to accommodate many variables but is confused about the main purpose of agrarian reform. The implementation of the law requires the existence of a dominant actor, but the actions of the street level bureaucrats have long reduced the purpose of the law to a mere act of legalization of accounting transactions for land that are running according to market mechanisms. Now, the increasing number of Indonesians living in urban areas makes the issue of land more complex, related to land use change and various challenges of sustainable development. The theory of agricultural involution becomes less relevant. A more systematic approach with more sophisticated tools, such as the Land Administration System, is needed to answer these challenges.";"Arsan Nurrokhman";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2019-11-03";"en";"agrarian reform;land administration";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"GBR";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DA-F9E-8E8";"http://osf.io/k83d4/download";"";"";"";"";"";""
"OSF_preprint:46072-ECE-4FE";"Land policies and evolving farm structures in transition countries";"";"The authors review the role of land policies in the evolving farm structure of transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). They show how different policies for land property rights, degrees of control of land rental and sale markets, and procedures for restructuring former collective or state farms resulted in significantly different farm structures in CEE countries compared with those in the CIS. In particular, secure land rights, greater emphasis on indivualization of land, and more liberal land market policies in CEE generated a farming sector with a relatively large share of family farms and viable corporate farms. On the other hand, limited tenure security, ineffective individualization of land rights, and restrictive land policies in most of the CIS produced a farming structure dominated by large and generally nonviable jointly-owned farms that function much like the old collective farms. Family farms are slow to emerge in transition countries with inadequate land policies. The agricultural sector in countries dominated by inefficient farm organizations is characterized by low productivity and misallocation of resources.

The first part of the paper briefly reviews the construction of customary tenure and the historical phases of administrative interventions into land tenure, and considers their heritage in contemporary situations. The second part reviews the increasing competition and conflict centered on land; the increase in various types of land transfers that are implicated in the pervasive social conflict focused on land; and the associated rise in social inequality and contestation over belonging and citizenship. The third and final part discusses ‘land grabs’, the most recent surge of international interest in African land, and external and internal threats to ‘customary’ rights in land. The overall conclusion is that while relations around land have long been central to political economy, culture and society across the continent, their greater salience in intensifying struggles among actors within and from outside Africa has significance for the disposition of authority, property and citizenship.";"Pauline Peters";"";"";"Center for Open Science";"2017-03-23";"en";"conflicts;customary tenure;land";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land Conflicts;Land in Post-Conflict Settings";"CAF;NOR";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618C-EEC-CE0";"";"";"";"";"";"";""

Driven by rising and highly volatile prices for agricul- tural commodities, large land acquisitions have been undertaken by foreign investors. We formalize the discussion surrounding such large scale land deals through a dynamic stochastic programming model. Within this framework, we first determine the value of a land development project under uncertainty about prices for agricultural commodi- ties, political risk and irreversible capital investment. Second, given an exogenously set corporate tax rate, we determine, in both a cooperative and a non-cooperative set- ting, the optimal land rental payment. We show that 1) the optimal policy scheme is equivalent to a risk-sharing contract, 2) trading o¤ rental payment with tax revenue is detrimental for both total project value and domestic benefits and 3) taxation has a neutral impact on long-run the land development pace. We complete our study by illustrating our results through an empirical application based on observed individual land deals from Ethiopia and simulations for a specific crop in a selected region that has recently been targeted by foreign investments.";"Sebastian Hess

We use a spatial econometric approach to estimate the drivers of US land use transitions in recent years. We consider transitions between six major land uses: agricultural land, forest, grassland, water, urban, and other uses. To examine drivers, we use a two-step linearized, spatial, multinomial logit model and estimate land use transition probabilities. Our results indicate that climate change is a driver of land use change and that movements to and from agricultural land and grassland exhibit opposite responses with climate change portending a movement out of cropland into grassland. These results indicate that adaptation to climate change through land usage change is ongoing but with spatial dependence.";"Ximing Wu

One of the goals of the conservation easement program we study is to protect contiguous habitat. We identify endogenous spatial interactions among conservation easements and government protected land, independent of spatially correlated landscape features and local economic shocks that influence easement enrollment. We present evidence that easements increase the likelihood of subsequent easements on neighboring land. Government-protected land appears to have little effect on the location of conservation easements. These results imply that conservation agencies have leveraged past conservation effort to enroll more contiguous habitat in permanent easements through a combination of targeting and positive social interactions among neighboring landowners.";"Wanhong Yang

"OSF_preprint:461F5-268-37B";"The price of empowerment : experimental evidence on land titling in Tanzania";"";"This paper reports on a randomized field experiment that uses price incentives to address economic and gender inequality in land tenure formalization. During the 1990s and 2000s, nearly two dozen African countries proposed de jure land reforms extending access to formal, freehold land tenure to millions of poor households. Many of these reforms stalled. Titled land remains the de facto preserve of wealthy households and, within households, men. Beginning in 2010, the study tested whether price instruments alone can generate greater inclusion by offering formal titles to residents of a low-income, unplanned settlement in Dar es Salaam at a range of subsidized prices, as well as additional price incentives to include women as owners or co-owners of household land. Estimated price elasticities of demand confirm that prices -- rather than other implementation failures or features of the titling regime -- are a key obstacle to broader inclusion in the land registry, and that some degree of pro-poor price discrimination is justified even from a narrow budgetary perspective. In terms of gender inequality, the study finds that even small price incentives for female co-titling achieve almost complete gender parity in land ownership with no reduction in demand.

Whether the impacts are indeed as devastating as the popular notion of land grabs would suggest depends on a number of factors, including the size of compensation payments, productivity spillovers on smallholders, employment opportunities for displaced farmers, and changes in food prices. We study the local welfare effects of land acquisitions in Sub-Saharan Africa using a theoretical model that captures the major channels through which land deals might affect rural African populations. We distinguish two basic scenarios. In the first scenario, the investor plants capital intensive staple food crops. Displaced farmers compete for a very limited number of jobs on the investment farm and spillovers to the remaining local farmers are rare. In the second scenario, where the investor is assumed to plant cash crops, potential spillovers through contract farming are larger and production is more labor intensive and hence provides better employment prospects. In both scenarios the crop produced on the investment farm is exported. The net welfare outcome varies with the relative strengths of the contradicting effects of spillovers, wages and food prices. We determine the minimum size of compensation payments for displaced farmers that would leave them as well off as staying on their plot. large-scale land acquisitions,local populations,welfare effects,displacement,food prices";"Linda Kleemann

The aim of this paper is to establish whether or not the absence of registered land titles is a barrier to credit access amongst SMEs. The study involved credit officers and the results amongst other things show that most formal lenders accept landed property for collateral purposes irrespective of whether they are registered or not. The paper concludes that even though land registration is important in facilitating the verification of land ownership, its absence is of no empirical consequence in terms of the availability of credit to SMEs.";"Abdulai R.T.

"OSF_preprint:461AF-9CE-DDD";"The Economics of Development: Integrating Land Economics and Portfolio Analysis";"";"This study integrates situs theory as defined by Andrews (1971) into comparative investment analysis, approaching a single use development from the perspective of modern investment theory and a potential mixed use development on the same site as a portfolio of uses generating portfolio risk and return trade-offs. The theoretical integration of situs theory, rent theory and portfolio/investment economics is tested against a statistically significant number of development proposal case studies, conducted during distinct economic phases (over time). The research objective extends the perspectives observed in the literature of development choices as the exercise of a real option by quantifying the risk-return patterns associated with the array of development options possible on a given site as supported by the situs process. The empirical documentation is achieved using multiple observations over distinct economic regimes. The inquiry as structured enables specification of the economic nature of a proposed developmentÃ­s returns (as either an economic rent, transfer earning or combination of both) and the risk-return combinations that can be used to characterize any given development strategy.

"OSF_preprint:46239-3BC-D5C";"Assessment of Land Governance in Bihar";"";"Land governance can be briefly described as how property rights to land, for groups or individuals, are defined, enforced, can be exchanged, and transformed. Land governance is argued to be a key to sustainable development and poverty reduction. In India, as well as in Bihar, land has enormous economic, social, and symbolic relevance. The present paper is an attempt to understand the issue of land governance from different perspective. The present study explores the historical background of development of land tenure typology and provides a detail account of land tenure system in the context of Bihar. As there are incidents of concentration in the ownership of the land and large number of disputes related to it, the paper analyse the available legal framework for dispute resolution. The present study also analyse some critical issues related to land governance and provide recommendation to bridge the gap for better land governance in the context of Bihar.

"OSF_preprint:461FC-020-4FC";"Nepal's Community Forestry Funds:Do They Benifit the Poor?";"";"Funds generated through community forestry offer crucial and significant resources for rural in Nepal. This study examines forestry funds in 100 communities in three districts to assess how large they are and how they are utilized. The study finds that the income from community funds increases local development resources by about 25%. This income is invested in schools, temples, roads, and water reservoirs, which bodes well for rural development. However, there are some critical problems with the 'pro-poor programmeâ€™, an effort to reduce poverty through the resources generated from community forestry. The study finds that timber is subsidized and the subsidies accrue mainly to the non-poor. Furthermore, income spent on loans tends to favor the non-poor. Overall some 74% of the benefits of community forestry funds accrue to the non-poor while 26% accrue to the poor in rural communities in Nepal. The study concludes that two actions may increase the benefits accruing to the poor: a) allowing all households to have an equal share in timber that is harvested; and b) increasing the participation of poor and less advantaged members in the executive committees that manage forestry funds.

The expectation is that formal institutions like law and courts fail to restrain or otherwise influence state agents’ rent-seeking behavior. In effect, they serve primarily as ornamentation. Regardless, these explanations fail to explain why both citizens and the State regularly turn to these institutions to settle property disputes. This Article focuses on conflicts over eminent domain and finds that in these cases the law provides lower and upper bounds for officials’ rent-seeking behavior. Within these limits, law combines with informal practices to determine legal outcomes. Although the law and courts sometimes provide citizens with opportunities for limited redress, they also help facilitate and legitimize officials’ use of eminent domain for personal enrichment.";"Margaret Hanson";"";"Center for Open Science";"Center for Open Science";"2018-03-19";"en";"eminent domain;land rights;property law;property rights";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"KAZ";"Reports & Research";"https://share.osf.io/preprint/46131-75C-11C";"http://osf.io/2czfb/download";"";"";"";"";"";""
"OSF_preprint:46088-909-6CE";"Evaluation on the Influencing Factors of Agricultural Land Productivity in Huang-Huai Plain, China";"";"Taking Huang-Huai Plain as an example, evaluation index system is established from four aspects, including the resources condition, the social and economic condition, the agricultural science and technology condition, and the disaster resistant and sustainable production condition. Correlation coefficient method and expert consultation method are used to determine the weight of evaluation index. After the standardization of extreme value, weighted sum method and multiple regression method are adopted to evaluate the influencing factors of agricultural land productivity in Huang-Huai Plain, China. Evaluation result shows that agricultural science and technology condition has a lower contribution rate to the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain than that to Henan Province. Resources condition has a higher contribution rate to the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain than that to Henan Province. Both the social and economic condition and the disaster control and sustainable production condition show relatively small contribution rate to the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain. It can be concluded that the main factors affecting the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain are the backward agricultural science and technology level, the poor farmland quality and the farmland infrastructure. Based on this, relevant suggestions are put forward to improve the farmland productivity of Huang-Huai Plain.";"Guo-Qiang Wang
