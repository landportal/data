On a global level, food security is closely linked to Goal 1 of the Millennium Development Goals, namely to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by, amongst others, halving, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. In addition, Goal 7 aims to ensure environmental sustainability by, amongst others, integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reversing the loss of environmental resources. This would include the loss of agricultural land to other developments.
Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations in 1992, urges governments to assess the impacts of current policies on, amongst others, food and agricultural sector performance, food security and rural welfare. The major thrust of food security referred to here is to bring about a significant and sustainable increase in agricultural production. In this regard it is necessary to formulate, introduce and monitor policies, laws and regulations leading to sustainable agricultural development.";http://pmg-assets.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/150316PDALFA_Draft_Policy_Doc.pdf;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"land use;land use planning;agriculture;natural resources management;agricultural landscape;food security;land cover;farming systems";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment

The evaluation process conducted by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) indicated that even though RADP had made some progress towards achieving its intended objectives, there was room for significant improvement. The best and lasting solution would entail a redesign and overhaul of all public agricultural support programmes and do away with existing silos of funding for agricultural support services. If RADP was implemented properly, the main objectives of the programme would be achieved, that is, to rekindle the class of black commercial farmers which were destroyed by the 1913 Natives Land Act.

The challenges experienced by beneficiaries included the lack of transparency and communication to strategic partners and farmers, a cumbersome process for approval of grants/funds and fraud and corruption by some strategic partners. There were delays in the disbursement of funds, non-compliance on the usage of RADP funds and a non-user friendly system for reconciliation of expenditure.";https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/20002/;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"development;agriculture;farmers";;

These principles of food security as well as an integrated, inclusive rural economy underpin the core focus areas of the National Development Plan, Vision 2030 (NDP). The NDP states that the national food security goal for South Africa is to maintain a positive trade balance for primary and processed agricultural products whilst job creation and increased agricultural productivity is needed to address food insecurity at household and individual level in rural areas. The concomitant Food Security Policy for the Republic of South Africa (2013) states unambiguously that food security is a key element of both poverty and inequality.

He said that expropriation is an essential mechanism for the state to acquire property in certain instances. Section 25 of the Constitution provides that property may be expropriated only in terms of general application and to that no law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property. The Constitution states that expropriation may occur only for a public purpose or in the public interest and subject to payment of compensation. Public interest includes the nation’s commitment to land reform, reforms to bring about equitable access to all South Africa’s natural resources and other reforms to redress the results of past racial discriminatory laws or practices. The Expropriation Act of 1975 was reviewed to ensure its consistency with Section 9, 25 and 33 of the Constitution as well as the extension of the purpose of expropriation to include public interest. Compensation in terms of the Expropriation Act 1975 was determined primarily on the market value of the expropriated property, but Section 25(3) of the Constitution requires “just and equitable” compensation be determined by having regard of all circumstances without placing undue weight on any single or particular factor. National, provincial and local government were empowered to expropriate property to varying degrees through several pieces of legislation and the Expropriation Bill seeks to ensure consistency with the Constitution and uniformity of procedure of all expropriation without interfering with the powers of expropriating authorities.;https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/20577/;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"land loans;property;property law;land reform;reforms;natural resources management;compensation";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment"

The Bill tried to limit how often people could go to court about the amount of compensation. The IRR argued that 60 days was not enough time for the claimant to institute legal proceedings for the determination of the compensation, this should be extended to 180 days. Compensation should include damages for additional losses. Compensation needed to be paid 15 days before the municipality took ownership of the property.;https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/21200/;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"compensation;property;investment funds;private ownership;land ownership;property rights";Land & Investments;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

Agri-SA believed that expropriation should only be used as a last resort where negotiations fail. There needed to be a clear purpose for expropriation. Compensation should never be dependent on the state’s ability to pay. The land owner should always be afforded recourse to the courts to contest both the merits of the expropriation and the compensation amount. Claimants should as far as possible be placed in the same position as was the case before the expropriation. Some of Agri SA’s concerns were the wide definitions of “expropriating authority” and “public interest”. These broad definitions left a lot of room for uncertainty. The gathering of relevant data was crucial to the calculation of compensation which was just and equitable. No land owner should either unduly benefit or from land reform. be penalised. Agri SA acknowledged that market value was not the only consideration, however it still has a central role to play in the approach adopted by our courts. Landowners, whose land was earmarked for land reform purposes, must be placed in a position to continue farming elsewhere should they wish to do so.;https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/21209/;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"land reform;rural development;compensation;land ownership;land rights;land acquisitions;poverty;land;land use;land cover;geomatics";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

In relation to the definitions, there was discussion on whether the Bill should refer to both high courts and magistrates’ courts.

Members wanted clarity on clause 9(1) particularly where the property to be expropriated was under a mortgage bond.

The campaign aims to mainstream gender equality, for it was proposed that the State should allocate one hectare of land, for the growing of food, to the poorest rural female-run households. It was believed that this would help alleviate poverty and empower rural women. It was pointed out that where women had land, their families generally were better nourished, better educated and able to move on. Land rights should be passed on officially to such women and they should then be able to build the skills of their children and pass the land to them in due course.;https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/21725/;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"gender equity in access to land;poverty;land rights;land;women;land ownership;land reform;private ownership;property rights;land use;agriculture;research;agricultural landscape;state property;land ownership";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

It seemed superfluous to make reference to an Act that had been repealed. Deputy Minister Cronin responded that clause 32(1)(b) clarified that “this Act does not apply to any expropriation initiated through delivery of a notice of expropriation prior to the date of commencement of this Act or to any consequences of any expropriation initiated or completed prior to the date of commencement of this Act”.

Challenges faced by CPAs included ongoing conflicts amongst CPA members which centred on governance issues, and the fact that some CPAs were insolvent and needed an injection of funds to put them on a sound footing. 29 CPAs were untraceable, 20 CPAs had lost (through sale or loss by attachment) 10 668 hectares of land, and nine CPAs were under administration. Compliant CPAs were those that updated the membership list, had a valid constitution, held regular AGMs and elections, and submitted annual reports to the Director General. 147 CPAs, involving 411 195 hectares of land, were referred to the Land Rights Management Facility (LRMF) for regularisation. 40 had been regularised to date, including 12 in 2014/15. 65 cases were pending, and 42 were unable to be regularised and were sent back to the Department.

The FFC said the rural share of poverty fell from 70% in 1993 to 57% in 2008 as a result of an improvement in household welfare due to social grant expenditure and migration to urban areas. Access to basic services had increased, but at slower pace than in urban areas. Rural areas were still characterized by significant poverty and inequality, however.

It would also regularise and support dysfunctional Community Property Associations, and administer legal and mediation assistance.

Apologies were received from the Minister and Deputy Minister. At the outset, Members expressed their dismay that the ITB was reporting from a document that contained different figures to the one sent through to Members earlier, and it was difficult to follow the presentation. Secondly, several commented that the reporting format was problematic, as it did not conform to standard practices nor terminology as used in the Public Finance Management Act. This was something that the Committee had previously pointed out and it again asked it to seek assistance in the reporting format from the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR). The Board was left in no doubt that its professionalism was in doubt when the documents were not checked before being sent to Members and when queries on figures could not be answered up front.;https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/20491/;Parliamentary Monitoring Group;ZAF;en;Legislation & Policies;Yes ;"rural development;compensation;land policies";;Land Policy & Legislation

In contrast to most other countries with unequal land distribution, South Africa has a history of specific racial policies with clear implications for land distribution and ownership. This heritage of inequality was formalised with the implementation of the two Natives Land Acts of 1913 and 1936. The first act gave only 8% and the second only 13% of South Africa’s territory to non-whites, who at the time represented about 90% of the country’s population. This legislation further confined the coloured population to reserves and the black population to bantustans, where land tenure was insecure and farming practices
mainly communal. Other measures restricted land tenancy or sharecropping possibilities for black and coloured populations living on land owned by white farmers, which in effect suffocated the (commercial) farming activities of these nonwhite farmers and prompted an exodus to the reserves and bantustans. The result of these policies was the acquisition of land by whites and the elimination of the black peasantry, who then provided cheap adult male labour for the commercial farming, industry and mining sectors (Van Onselen, 1996)…” ";http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/108281;AgEcon Search;ZAF;en;Reports & Research;Yes ;"land distribution;development;land reform;sustainable development;land administration;land policies";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land Policy & Legislation

The second amendment sought to increase the number of days from 10 to 20 whereby the expropriating authority may utilise as much of the compensation money in question as is necessary for the payment, if the said amount is not disputed in writing by the expropriated owner or expropriated holder.

To achieve this, policy packages should be constructed to give coherence, with an explicit goal and set of objectives, underscoring accountability to delivery. Considering current policy debates, the questions pursued in this paper are: does a clear vision guide existing and emerging agriculture and food policies and are a clear set of measures defined to achieve this vision? By analysing several relevant policies, the paper argues that South African food and agricultural policy profoundly lacks coherence;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/wp39-foodagripolicy-drimie;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;ZAF;en;Policy Papers & Briefs;Yes ;"agriculture;food security";Land & Food Security;

European settlement began around the  Cape of Good Hope in the 1650s and progressed northwards and eastwards over a period of three hundred years. By the twentieth century, most of the county, including most of the best agricultural land, was reserved for the minority white settler population, with the African majority confined to just 13% of the territory, the ‘native reserves’, later known as African Homelands or Bantustans (Thomson 1995: 109). Demands for racial equality were violently resisted by the white-minority government up to 1990, with the result that South Africa made the transition to democratic, non-racial government only in 1994 ;http://www.plaas.org.za/plaas-publication/lalrwp14-landreform-poverty;Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies;ZAF;en;Policy Papers & Briefs;Yes ;"land reform;poverty;land acquisitions;farming systems";;Land Use, Management & Investment

Over thirteen million black people, the majority of them poverty-stricken, remained crowded into the former homelands, where rights to land were generally unclear or contested and the system of land administration was in disarray (Hendricks 1990; Cousins 1996; Lahiff 2000). These areas were characterised by extremely low per capita incomes and high rates of infant mortality, malnutrition and illiteracy relative to the rest of the country. On privately-owned (white) farms, millions of workers and their families faced tenure insecurity and lack of basic facilities.

Land registration is also on the ethnojustice agenda in parts of Africa and beyond. Yet legal empowerment via registration and titling is also advocated by those who push for the market-enhancing and aggregate growth-promoting commodification of property rights, whereby market forces will transfer land out of the hands of smallholders and into the hands of ‘those who can make most efficient or productive use of it’.

They say their world would be destroyed by mining.

Neverthe-less, agriculture typically still remains the backbone of rural life and is usually considered the prime source of economic security, social prestige and self-identity. The task of narrating these somewhat contradictory processes in a conceptually coherent fashion has proven a major challenge for research. This paper responds to this problem by deploying an adapted version ofAndrew Dorward’s schema of households ‘hanging in, stepping up or stepping out’ of their landed interests. Dorward’s middle-ground theory provides an appropriate analytical vehicle for capturing the vagaries and situated complexities of the land-livelihoods nexus. However the theory fails to fully appreciate the extent to which household livelihood decision making rests on complex entanglements that leverage land-based and nonfarm activities against one another. We demonstrate the critical importance of these processes through the results ofin-depth interviews with 32 households in two north Indian villages. These interviews lead us to propose that land factors in livelihood aspirations in three fundamental ways: an arena for interpenetrated agrarian and nonagrarian livelihood streams; a base for social reproduction;and a bulwark of food (and by extension, livelihood) security through own-productioncapabilities…”";http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sjtg.12180/epdf;Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography;001;en;Reports & Research;Yes ;"land;agrarian reform;sustainable development;land ownership";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;

This paper discusses why secure tenure rights for local communities, indigenous peoples and women are central to good natural resource governance and important for livelihoods and human rights, as recognized in multiple international conventions. The paper reviews both challenges and opportunities for securing rights in practice and highlights successful cases of tenure reform. Communities are likely to continue to face resistance and opposition to recognition, and competition for land and natural resources, from more powerful actors, even after rights have been granted. Successfully recognizing and securing tenure requires a strong, evidence-based understanding of these challenges in order to design effective strategies to overcome them. This includes building coalitions and supporting grassroots organizations and social movements; designing a clear roadmap, with communities, for implementation; supporting the enabling conditions for improvements in livelihoods and effective and sustainable resource management; and monitoring progress to adapt to and confront new challenges";http://www.cifor.org/library/6386/recognition-and-respect-for-tenure-rights/;Center for International Forestry Research;001;en;Reports & Research;Yes ;"land tenure systems;land tenure;land reform;rural population;local community;forestry;land governance;natural resources management;women";"Land & Gender;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security"

It finds that while all four strengthened women’s formal land rights, only the reforms in Bolivia and Brazil resulted in a significant share and number of female beneficiaries. In both countries, strong national?level rural women’s movements were the main advocates behind women’s land rights in a context in which they formed part of the coalition that brought these regimes to power.

Evidence of coastal grab is provided from four country settings (Canada, Brazil, India and South Africa), distinguishing the identity of the ‘grabbers’ (industry, government) and ‘victims’, the scale and intensity of the process, and the resultant ‘booty’.

In particular, certain provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament have rendered tree planting, agro-biofuel cultivation, and forest conservation attractive investments in Tanzania and Uganda.

Western states have reacted to the SADC land reform programme (LRP) by imposing severe economic sanctions on target states while SADC states have, in the aftermath of the Campbell decision, suspended the very SADC Tribunal for handing down that decision, pending review of its jurisdiction. Further, SADC states have limited the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to inter-state matters only, shutting the door on individual petitions for any alleged human rights abuses. At the heart of this matter is the issue of contested title to lands that the SADC Tribunal had dealt with in the Campbell case. This article applies Nozick's entitlement theory to determine the question of entitlement as a means of illuminating the incommensurabilities around the SADC land issue. Formalist arguments that are premised on strict and purist positions on either side of these incommensurabilities are weighed under the light of entitlement theory. The article shows that because of its historically multi-layered dimensions, the SADC land issue appears ill-suited to legal formalist arguments that ignore both the historical context of colonialism and forcible expropriation of native titles without compensation.;https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/ajicl.2017.0197?journalCode=ajicl;African Journal of International and Comparative Law;001;en;Reports & Research;Yes ;land reform;;

Recently, the agricultural sector in Sub-Saharan Africa has attracted attention from scholars, civil society and policy makers that are interested in understanding the recent increase in the demand for agricultural land, often referred to as the “rush for land.” This increased demand for agricultural land has raised expectations that the new wave of private investments could lead to growth and poverty reduction – and could thereby catalyze a long awaited transformation of the continent’s rural areas;http://www.pegnet.ifw-kiel.de/publications/pegnet-policy-brief_10.pdf;PEGNet Policy Brief;002;en;Policy Papers & Briefs;Yes ;"unclaimed lands;agriculture;land investments;agriculture;poverty";Land & Investments;Land Use, Management & Investment

How the topic of land reform is used by political forces, especially the ruling party; the African National Congress and current President Jacob Zuma. Does the Republic of South Africa take a populist turn on land reform or is it some kind of social justice after the suppression of the apartheid era and decades before? The political disputes and decisions will be analysed in confrontations with the fundamentals and values of a democratic state as a guarantee of property rights, private ownership and free market principles (dilemma of the problem of willing buyer - willing seller). It will be necessary to present the historical background of land problem in the RSA. The problem will be investigated in connection with the socio-economic situation of the RSA. The study will also tackle the problem of social and economic inequality from the perspective of politics. In the paper, a mix of primary and secondary research methods of data collection and analysing will be used. Theoretical framework will be based on assumptions of political discourse and the paradigm of “classic” land reform.";https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/werk.2017.12.issue-1/werk-2017-0005/werk-2017-0005.xml;De Gruyter Online;ZAF;en;Reports & Research;Yes ;land reform;;
