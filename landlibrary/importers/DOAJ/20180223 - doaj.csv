"DOAJ:80aca290b1ac4d61b43dc99a4994ed98";"THE VALUE AND ROLE OF LAND MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES LAND";"";"Planning of land use by land - is an integral part of the management of land use, which provides a mechanism by which decisions are coordinated among various local, regional and national authorities, and helps implement social responsibilities of public authorities in the use and protection of land and other natural resources.

Today, during the implementation of the decentralization of power, much attention is given to the transition from the existing centralized approach to conventional land-use planning (conventional land use planning), which the world is seen more as a institutional approach (institutional approach) to the agreed land use planning (rarticipatory land use planning), which puts the interests of the foundation rights of economic, environmental, technological and socio-cultural conditions.

Accordingly, it is important to define the relationship between the components of local governance in land development and local communities to identify the main stages of its planning, which will allow to solve social and economic problems of land use while preserving the natural ecological sustainability of land and other natural resources like land development and land use planning. It is also associated with a change in the land system ofUkraineand the transition to market land relations, which requires the transition to a new system of land use and proper planning it with the realities of today.

During the 2000-2016 biennium. Ukraine has experienced an unprecedented reform of collective agricultural enterprises in market-oriented agricultural farm land for the project made it possible to dramatically increase the share of agricultural land owned by agricultural cooperatives (14.5%), limited liability companies (26.4%) and private (private rental) companies (10.4%). Nearly 405,000 farmers based on their land shares (shares) created over an area of more than 1.6 mln. Ha of farmland farms.

However, after the enactment of the Land Code of Ukraine (2001) power rural town councils on order, including the management of land use, land narrowed to only settlements. This led to the decline in land management activities performed. Also, due to lack of funding work on complex land use of rational use of land and their health are not implemented. This land use agricultural land use, which functioned until 1990 was destroyed, and new forms of the rational internal build area to date has not been established.

According to Art. 130 Land Code of Ukraine emptive right to purchase agricultural land are citizens ofUkraine, permanently residing in the territory of the local council, where the sale of land, as well as relevant local authorities. However, the status of territory of the local council in land law is not defined.

No separation of state and municipal property without development of land management projects within the areas of village councils to streamline land farms has created a number of problems of forecasting, planning and organization of rational use and protection of land at local and economic levels, and therefore financially stable communities. Thus, the importance and role of land management at the local level in the development of local communities land use at this stage of development of land relations is growing. But it needs to speed up recovery (existing before the adoption of the Land Code of Ukraine in 2001) the powers of local communities in the sphere of land relations.";"N.

disaggregato fanno riferimento, in questo caso, alla dimensione territoriale anziché, come più frequente, a quella settoriale. Più specificamente, con riferimento alla dotazione infrastrutturale presente in Italia si è cercato di ricostruire gli indicatori a livello provinciale sulla base degli analoghi indicatori disponibili a livello
regionale. A tal fine si è seguito un approccio metodologico di tipo Chow-Lin, utilizzando quali regressori rappresentativi della domanda territoriale di infrastrutture alcune variabili relative agli aspetti produttivi, demografici e di uso turistico del territorio. Il confronto tra i risultati così ottenuti (ossia gli indicatori
infrastrutturali “stimati”) e i dati “effettivi” (ossia gli indicatori di dotazione infrastrutturale disponibili a livello provinciale) ha consentito un’interessante e non banale verifica della coerenza tra fattori territoriali di domanda e offerta di infrastrutture in Italia.";"Francesco Vidoli

The implementation process of the Syracuse’s Master Plan is characterized by the widespread use of “urban negotiation”. The Muni- cipality has drawn up a protocol aimed at obtaining areas for facilities and public infrastructures in different areas basing on the rule of the transfer of a portion of land in return for the building permission for the remaining part. Since these areas are variously cha- racterized, the negotiation process may not be fair to Municipality or convenient to land owners. Basing on an equalization pattern, this study provides, for each area, the indexes of fairness and convenience, and, more specifically, the difference between the market value of the areas achieved and the value of the permits issued. And based on the possibility to transfer the development rights, some different scenarios are prefigured about the possibility of acquiring additional areas for social housing and/or achieving funds for su- stainable buildings.

"DOAJ:e22a084491984cc3a483a4ec53cdfa41";"The transformation of urban industrial land use: A quantitative method";"";"A large number of cities around the world today owe their land use growth to the rapid development of industrial areas. The spatial structure of industrial distribution in cities shape urban spatial morphology linking with land use, transportation, economic activities, and housing. Meanwhile, growth and expansion of city population and land use reconfigure the spatial structure of industrial distribution. Research into urban industrial spatial distribution and its transformation process may help urban planners and decision makers understand the land use and population dynamics of a city. Genetic algorithms are believed to be one kind of the promising methods to simulate this dynamic process. In this paper, we propose a novel method to simulate urban industrial spatial distribution and its transformation process in Shanghai, China. The results show that along with increasing urban land price over time, industries are going to move outward from the city center. However, the maximum profit of a firm tends to decrease, which could lead industrial factories to move beyond city boundary. The analysis of the current industrial spatial distribution in Shanghai indicates that, when land price in a city rises above a specific threshold, new government policies and other competitive advantages need to be enacted if the city wants to retain industrial firms within the city boundary.";"Rongxu Qiu

The<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;""> </strong>overarching theoretical frame is social-ecological resilience thinking and its potential application to as well as implications for urban land-use development. The paper draws its main attention on if this concept can be of use for urban planners dealing with change and urban infrastructure and if a readiness towards its application can be identified. This endeavor is informed by two explorative studies in Germany. One study gains its material from a scenario process with planning practitioners and further urban stakeholders of a medium-sized city. Main topic was how to deal with the challenges of climate change impacts in urban planning and development. The second explorative study reflects research results on the readiness to apply the resilience concept to urban planning dealing with change and local infrastructure in a small community. The scenario process showed that applying social-ecological resilience thinking to urban planning helps to critically reflect so far taken paths in local built infrastructure, to take on an integrated perspective and to develop new and innovative strategies for further land-use development. Nevertheless, such a process requires additional financial as well as human resources and translation exercises. Also, the given path dependency as well as financial constrains are hindering to perceive any leeway in infrastructure development at the political level, so that any real implementation at the moment seems to be out of sight, which is also caused by multi-level dependencies.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">  </span></span></p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

near-natural biotopes in landscapes strongly transformed by man. The vegetation of sacred sites in Morocco was
studied recently. Information about their number, spatial pattern or relief position is fragmentary. However, these
parameters are important to evaluate their role as refuge for organisms and their representativeness of potential
natural vegetation.
Therefore, density and spatial pattern of sacred sites on the Tangier Peninsula in NW Morocco were studied based
on records on topographic maps and by ground check. Their relief position was examined calculating a logistic
regression model based on site-presences and random pseudo-absences.
A ground check showed that around 67% of the existing sacred sites are documented in the topographic maps.
They occur in the whole study area but are agglomerated around settlements. Although sacred sites occur with
preference at elevated sites they can be found in almost all relief positions, thus offering the potential of supporting
different types of climax vegetation (climatic climax and pedoclimax). Because of their abundance (around 29
sacred sites / 100 km²) and their distribution pattern they could serve as elements of a biotope network in
degraded landscapes.";"Holger Jäckle

Este trabalho trata do planejamento do parcelamento do solo de forma participativa para a Ecoagrovila Renascer, desenvolvido pelo escritório modelo CASAS no âmbito da disciplina de PEMAU[1]. A demanda surgiu por inciativa do Movimento Rio São Bartolomeu Vivo que trabalha com comunidades na bacia hidrográfica visando a regeneração das margens dos córregos da região, bem como da necessidade de buscar apoio no processo de planejamento junto ao INCRA (portaria nº 321/1997) nos moldes do Projeto de Assentamento Casulo. A tipologia de assentamento trata de garantir um espaço de desenvolvimento compartilhado e descentralizado onde serão exploradas atividades agroecológicas economicamente viáveis e ecologicamente sustentáveis, com atividades agropecuárias e desenvolvimento de comunidades mais justas e conscientes. O objetivo deste artigo é demonstrar o processo de planejamento baseado no conceito de Ecovila e princípios de sustentabilidade para o desenho do lugar com introdução de metodologias participativas, que envolveu estudantes e assentados do Movimento de Apoio à Trabalhadora e ao Trabalhador – MATR. Foram desenvolvidas quatro propostas para 40 e 50 famílias, de 2 a 2,5 hectares por lote, em quatro níveis de realidade distintos – da realidade concreta do assentamento ao sonho comunitário dos moradores.

Abstract 

This work aims to present the participatory planning process of land division in the “Ecoagrovila Renascer”. It was developed at PEMAU[1], a course part of CASAS – the architecture student’s office for social projects in FAU/UnB. The project demand came from “Rio São Bartolomeu Vivo Movement” which works with communities settled at the watershed of São Bartolomeu river helping them with the regeneration of local streams and supporting the legalizing processes of the settlements, legally framed by “Projeto de assentamento Casulo” from INCRA (nº321/1997). Casulo is a Settlement Typology that looks after social and environmental awareness by promoting decentralized space for community development in rural areas, throughout economic and ecologically sustainable agroecological activities. This paper objective is to present a planning process based on Ecovilla’s concept and Sustainability Principles for space, as well as to share the participatory methodology used that involved students and settlers from MATR – a movement for workers support. As a result, 4 proposals were presented, varying from 50 to 40 families at land plots of 2 to 2,5 ha and responding to four different reality levels, allowing students to explore the way from basic reality situations to the settlers’ community dreams.

Starting from these assumptions, the study seeks to identify guidelines with a robust evaluation and management control system: points that underpin the drafting of strategic documents for cultural enhancement and sustainability, social inclusion and tourism-economic development of the reference territory.
The article develops in two parts: 
1) comparison between economic approaches, decision-making support instruments and management control systems in the light of reasoning regarding the approach of cultural planning and points of reflection resulting from the analysis of different international museum accreditation systems and management documents or cultural heritage, such as the UNESCO Management Plans;
2) analysis, that combines the interdisciplinary vision with a more strictly disciplinary vision of enhancement and management of Cultural Heritage, finds a critical synthesis in the SWOT, and in the final synoptic framework, that delineate some suggestions regarding the role of the museum in the cultural planning process.";"Maria Vittoria Brigato";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-12-31";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_2_16_5e";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"26"
"DOAJ:7bd7f6a84dd541feaa9ae196d7c9650a";"Do You Have 5 Minutes To Spare? –The Challenges Of Stakeholder Processes In Ecosystem Services Studies";"";"Operationalization of the ecosystem services (ES) concept for improved natural resource management and decision support
cannot, thus far, be rated as satisfactory. Participation of stakeholders is still a major methodical and conceptual challenge for implementing ES. Therefore, we conducted an online survey and a literature analysis to identify benefits and challenges of the
application of ES in participatory processes. The results show that the purpose of stakeholder engagement is very diverse as a
result of varying objectives, spatial scales and institutional levels of analysis. The complexity, terminology and (lacking) coherent
classification of ES are pivotal aspects that should be accounted for in the design of studies to improve stakeholder participation.
Although limitations of time and financial resources are bigger challenges than ES related ones, tailoring communication
strategies and information for different stakeholder groups are of major importance for the success of ES studies. Results support
the view that the potential benefits of applying ES, e.g., consensus finding, and development of integrated solutions, cannot be realized consistently across the different spatial scales and decision-making levels. Focusing on stakeholder processes represents a means to increase the relevance, reliability and impact of study results and to move participation in ES research from theory to reality.";"Koschke, L.

Land Uptake and Landscapes Changes";"";"<span lang=""EN-US"">The phenomenon of urban sprawl has been already recognized as one of the major anthropic threats to natural ecosystems and landscapes while the negative aspects of the phenomenon are still only marginally taken into consideration in the scientific and local government circles. The recent decision of the European Parliament points out that the degradation, fragmentation and non-sustainable use of land in the EU is jeopardizing several important ecosystem services, threatening biodiversity and increasing Europe’s vulnerability to climate change, natural disasters and desertification. The study regards the processing of data on urban land conversion over the past 50 years and the effects in the areas of high environmental vulnerability in one of the most important Italian region: Tuscany. The historical data were compared from a qualitative and quantitative viewpoint with the present-day geography of settlements, which showing changes found in today’s settlement-territorial structure. The conclusion reports focuses on collated environmental criticalities and the margins for recovery of the compromised territories that still today receive little attention from central institutions and local authorities, in addition to data on landscape effects to be construed as signs of specific trends underway today and scarcely taken into account by land management tools.</span>";"Francesco Zullo

Il caso studio della Costiera Amalfitana";"";"I paesaggi culturali rappresentano una risorsa fondamentale per lo sviluppo sostenibile. Tra questi, i paesaggi terrazzati sono classificati come paesaggi culturali “evolutivi viventi” (UNESCO, 2012), espressione della storica interrelazione tra uomo e territorio. Attualmente molti paesaggi terrazzati sono considerati a rischio a causa delle mutate condizioni socio-economiche. L’esigenza della conservazione e di una gestione efficace di questo eccezionale patrimonio pone la questione dell’identificazione di funzioni e valori complessi del paesaggio, tenendo conto di bisogni, visioni e preferenze delle comunità
locali. Questo studio ha l’obiettivo di identificare valori e servizi del paesaggio terrazzato sulla base della teoria dei servizi ecosistemici. Viene affrontato il tema della valutazione e mappatura dei servizi culturali, con riferimento al paesaggio terrazzato della Costiera Amalfitana in Campania. Le categorie di servizi sono state valutate con il coinvolgimento della comunità locale attraverso un questionario semi-strutturato somministrato online ad un campione di 147 soggetti. L’integrazione tra valutazione multicriterio e analisi spaziale in ambito GIS (Geographic Information System) ha condotto alla costruzione di mappe dei servizi culturali che permettono di visualizzare in maniera sintetica le relazioni complesse che legano l’uomo al
paesaggio. Gli strumenti di mapping collaborativo (Volunteered Geographic Information – VGI) sono stati utilizzati per la costruzione di alcune delle mappe dei servizi culturali, integrando i risultati del questionario con i dati relativi all’esperienza diretta degli utenti.";"Antonia Gravagnuolo";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-06-30";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_1_16_5i";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"25"
"DOAJ:2e5919038d1746c488de6ea22b409a90";"Are interest groups different in the factors determining landscape preferences?";"";"In the last decades, rural landscape in Europe has evolved from an agricultural by-product to an important
public good. This development creates not only new challenges to farming practices, it also makes
participation and public involvement an indispensable tool for sustainable landscape planning. This is
especially true for many European mountain regions, where tourism represents an important source of
income and conflicts between locals’ and tourists’ interests should be avoided. In our study, we analyze
whether discrepancies in the perception of the Alpine landscape can be located between locals and
tourists and, if these differences exist, in which aspects these two groups are differing. A model employing
three general factors able to describe landscape preferences regardless of the personal background
is suggested and validated by confirmatory factor analysis. Our major finding shows that an attractive
landscape for tourists does not have to be contradictory to a landscape that supports a high living quality
for locals. Compromises in landscape planning between locals’ and tourists’ requirements seem often
not to be necessary as they, generally, do not differ in the way they experience and assess the landscape.";"Maria Bacher

When westernised courts have to interpret and adjudicate these customary traditions and norms, the normal rules of statutory interpretation cannot be followed. The court has to rely on evidence of the traditional values of land use to determine the rules connected to land tenure.Previously courts in many mixed jurisdictions relied on common or civil law legal principles to determine the nature of customary land tenure and lay down the principles to adjudicate customary land disputes among traditional communities, or between traditional and westernised communities in the same jurisdiction. Many examples of such westernised approach can be found in case law of Canada and South Africa. The interpretation of the nature of customary land tenure according to common law or civil law principles has been increasingly rejected by higher courts in South Africa and Canada, e.g. in Alexkor Ltd v The Richtersveld Community 2004 5 SA 469 (CC) and Delgamuukw v British Columbia 1997 3 SCR 1010. This paper explores the methodology the courts should follow to determine what the distinctive nature of customary land tenure is. As customary land tenure is not codified or based on legislation, the court has to rely, in addition to the evidence of indigenous peoples, on the expert evidence of anthropologists and sociologists in determining the nature of aboriginal title (in Canada) and indigenous land tenure (in South Africa). The court must approach the rules of evidence and interpret the evidence with a consciousness of the special nature of aboriginal claims and the evidentiary difficulties in proving a right which originates in times where there were no written records of the practices, customs and traditions engaged in. The court must not undervalue the evidence presented simply because that evidence does not conform precisely with the evidentiary standards that would be applied in, for example, a private law tort case.";"Gerrit Pienaar";"";"North-West  University";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2012-09-30";"af;de;en;nl";"";"";"";"ZAF;018;CAN";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://www.nwu.ac.za/webfm_send/58704";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.nwu.ac.za/p-per/editorial-policy";"31"

They involve many individual or collective actors (users, managers, public or private companies, associations, etc.) as well as rules and norms of behavior that these actors are the recipients or agents. Complex systems, if any, these policies have several kinds of effects, expected and unexpected, direct and indirect effects, societal, economic, environmental and eco-systemic. The current development of multi-agent platforms opens up a new area for the definition, design, implementation and monitoring of water management by producing ex ante simulations of the impact of measures that promote water public policies and of the likely evolution of the socio-hydrosystem concerned. Here we give a quick overview of these new opportunities of water policy modeling and impact assessment. We summarize the steps of the modeling process and present the main ingredients entering in the composition of a platform dedicated to impact simulations.

Because CRP includes primarily grass habitats, it has great potential to benefitdeclining North American grassland bird populations. We looked at the change in national and state population trends of grassland birds and related changes to cover-specific CRP variables (previous research grouped all CRP practices). Changes in national trends after the initiation of the CRP were inconclusive, but we observed signficant bird-CRP relations at the state level. Most bird-CRP relations were positive, except for some species associated with habitats that CRP replaced. Practice- and configuration-specific CRP variables were related to grassland bird trends, rather than a generic measure of all CRP types combined. Considering all CRP land as a single, distinct habitat type may obscure actual relations between birds and set-aside characteristics. Understanding and predictingthe effects of set-aside programs (like CRP or agri-environment schemes) on grassland birds is complex and difficult.

The basic production of agricultural products, the food security of the state and its export potential today depend directly on the ability of agricultural producers to conduct sustainable production. However, in addition to the natural elements that stand in the way of stabilizing the situation in the field of agriculture, we also have a chronic presence of numerous ""man-made"" problems that remain unsettled for years. One of the most significant and painful of them is the state registration of the right to lease land. Long-term disorder, corporate wars between state authorities for the right to land relations, negligent attitude to information on land rights and their encumbrances, the shifting of competence among registrars of land tenure rights continue to cause complaints from agricultural producers. But the peculiarities of the legal regulation of the state registration of the right to lease land for agricultural purposes did not become the subject of a separate scientific study. Consequently, the purpose of this work is to study and analyze the problems of legal regulation of state registration of the right to lease land and to find an acceptable option for their further solution.

Since the reform of the agrarian sector of Ukraine, the most common form of land use in agricultural production is the use of land by agricultural producers on a lease. The advantage of leasing relations in agricultural production is enshrined in the Concept of the State Target Program for Land Relations Development in Ukraine for the period up to 2020, which was approved by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated June 17, 2009 No. 743-p.

The right to lease a land plot is mediated by a contract concluded in accordance with the Article 20 of the Law of Ukraine ""On land lease"" is subject to mandatory state registration,on the other hand in Article 125 of the Land Code of Ukraine, it is stated that the right to lease a land plot arises from the moment of state registration of this right. Thus, the fact of registration of the lease contract for agricultural land is a necessary condition for determining the legality of land use of agricultural producers.

The state registration of the right to lease a land plot of agricultural land is preceded by a state registration of a land plot that is the subject of a lease and a state registration of the ownership of such a land plot. The right to lease a land plot used for agricultural production arises from the moment of state registration of this right. The intended purpose and type of use within the purpose of the leased land should be identical both in the lease agreement of the land plot and in the State Land Cadastre. State registration of land lease agreements for agricultural purposes provides legal guarantees regarding the actual use of land in agricultural production activities.";"Hunko L.A.

The concept of ‘ecological risk‘ gives a measure of the likelihood of ecosystem failure to provide the level of natural ecological goods and services expected/desired by human societies. As a consequence of human pressures (use of resources and discharge into the environment), ecosystem thresholds can be breached thus resulting in major threats to human health, safety and well-being. In this study we apply the concept of ‘ecological risk‘ to two case-studies in the German exclusive economic zone: eutrophication and construction of offshore wind farms. The effects of different future scenarios for single-uses upon ecosystem integrity are analysed as well as the effects of one combined scenario. We conclude that in the short term construction of offshore wind farms can influence some processes to a much larger degree than eutrophication, however, combined impacts deriving from eutrophication and offshore wind farm construction need a more detailed analysis. Due to non-linear ecosystem processes, effects of combined or multiple uses of marine resources in terms of ‘ecological risk‘, cannot be extrapolated from single-use scenarios.";"C. Nunneri

On the newly exposed forefields, subfossil wood remnants are being outwashed from beneath ice and snow bodies. In Scandinavia, this kind of detrital wood is a previously unused source of postglacial vegetation and climate history. The present study reports radiocarbon dates of a set of 78 wood samples, retrieved from three main sites, high above modern treelines and stretching along the Swedish Scandes. In accord with previous studies, pine (Pinus sylvestris) colonized early emerging nunataks already during the Late Glacial. Around 9600-9500 cal. yr BP a first massive wave of tree establishment, birch and pine, took place in “empty” glacier cirques. Both species grew 400-600 m above their present-ay treeline position and the summer temperatures may have been 3.5 °C warmer than present. In respons to Neoglacial cooling, treelines of both birch and pine descended until their final disappearance from the record 4400 and 5900 cal. yr BP, respectively. During the entire interval 9600 to 4400 cal. yr BP, birch prospered in a 100-150 broad belt above the uppermost pines. The recent emergence of tree remnants in the current habitats relates to the contemporary episode of climate warming, possibly unprecedented for several past millennia. It is inferred, by an anology with the past, that in a future scenario with summers 3.5 ° warmer than present, the birch treeline may rise by 600 m or so.";"Lisa Öberg

Abstract
The contemporary metropolis results from the interaction between the global dynamics of urban sprawl and a territorial support that is local and specific. In Galicia, city growth over the territory has occurred through precarious forms of colonization by building iniciatives of both thoroughfares and the rural matrix. This happened because the strenght of urbanizing dynamics that procedeed by minimizing the burdens over real state was confronted by a weak public administration, supported by a land regulation that, applied to the Galician territory, allowed the treatment of rural situations as urban.

The integrity of the fishery is, however, under threat due to various land-use practices, which could weaken its appeal as a tourist attraction. The aim of this study is to estimate the amount recreational users are willing to pay for a project to improve the trout habitat of waters managed by the Wild Trout Association (WTA) in this fishery in order to improve its fish population density by 100 per cent. Data were collected from a biased sample of 96 respondents via a questionnaire during September 2006 to September 2007. The median estimated willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the project was R245 per annum per person, and the total WTP was estimated at R171 500 per annum. A valuation function to predict WTP responses was also estimated, and showed that gross annual pre-tax income and the number of visits per annum were positive determinants of WTP. The results of this study show that policy-makers should take heed of the importance trout fly fishers attach to this fishery when declaring trout zones in the upper catchments of South Africa. The aggregate WTP estimation, however, constitutes only a partial analysis of value. A number of other factors and environmental value streams need to be analysed and compared with the value estimates generated by this study if adequate holistic decision-making is to take place with regard to trout stream improvement. More specifically, the aggregate WTP estimated in this study must be viewed as only one input into a comprehensive social cost-benefit analysis to determine the desirability of trout stream improvement for wider society.";"Mario Du Preez

The development of decentralised human settlements, involving the appropriation of land for domestic space and the self-organisation of neighbourhoods, were strategies to protect communities from adversity and secure collective self-reliance.</p> <p class=""Textocorrido"">Following Mozambique’s conversion to globalization, the post-colonial ‘cement city’ is now the core of neo-liberalism, as a node of the global economy, where foreign donors and international market economy control national political economy, exacerbating the premise of the negation of self-sufficiency that continues to evolve resiliently at its margins. The adoption of a neo-liberal model of development during the 1990s, completely bypasses the realities of Mozambican society. This paper argues that the strategy of self-production of space regarding the household/Outdoor Domestic Space unit, which existed previously as a resistance strategy, first of all against colonialism and secondly, against the statist definition of socialism, thirdly, has become a successful strategy for survival, as the building block of the decentralised Agrocity, in the face of a global economy which totally neglects both the people and the land.</p> Outdoor Domestic Space is a multifaceted space that refers to the external space surrounding the built house and which, in the case of Mozambique, is where daily life takes place, involving strong social, ecological and productive functions. Under successive periods of political economy oppression and environmental adversity, the Outdoor Domestic Space has been adapted and refined to ensure collective self-reliance. Shaping a green and ruralised urbanisation at the margins of the Mozambican post-colonial dualistic city, which I call the Agrocity, the Outdoor Domestic Space is resilient because it is able to adjust domestic space as a strategy to secure livelihoods, provide urban food, commerce and services, maintain vital kinship relationships and produce a comfortable and clean microclimate across the spontaneous neighbourhoods. This spatial resilience is the feature underlying the self-organisation of neighbourhoods with a new way of overcoming alienation from nature, which suggest the continuance of an innate relationship between society, the human habitat and nature.";"Céline Felicio Veríssimo";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2012-07-31";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"MOZ";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/911";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"15"

L’imporsi nel dibattito del tema del consumo di suolo ha parzialmente modificato questo schema, trasformando un tradizionale strumento di verifica e monitoraggio nell’obiettivo strategico prioritario delle politiche di governo del
territorio. Ciò avrebbe richiesto un ripensamento radicale dell’approccio al tema, come confermano anche i risultati assai deludenti delle politiche poste in atto finora. Il presente paper si propone di indagare le ragioni di metodo e di merito che hanno concorso al sostanziale fallimento delle politiche di contenimento del consumo di suolo, concentrandosi soprattutto su due aspetti:
la comprensione delle cause strutturali del fenomeno e l’efficacia degli strumenti di conoscenza e monitoraggio. In riferimento a quest’ultimo punto, vengono in particolare spiegate e illustrate, anche con esempi applicativi, le peculiarità e le potenzialità che le banche dati catastali e dell’Osservatorio del Mercato Immobiliare potrebbero avere nella costruzione di quadri conoscitivi funzionali alla pianificazione urbanistica e territoriale.";"Maurizio Festa

The demand for food and feeding stuff rises while at the same time energy, chemicals and other materials also need to be produced from biomass because of decreasing fossil resources. However, the biorefinery ideas and concepts can help to use the limited renewable raw materials more efficiently than today. With biorefineries, valuable products, such as platform chemicals, can be produced from agricultural feedstock, which can subsequently be further processed into a variety of substances by the chemical industry. Due to the role they play as producers of biomass, rural areas will grow in importance in the decades to come. Parts of the biorefinery process can be relocated to the rural areas to bring a high added value to these regions. By refining biomass at the place of production, new economic opportunities may arise for agriculturists, and the industry gets high-grade pre-products. Additionally, an on-farm refining can increase the quality of the products because of the instant processing. To reduce competition with the food production and to find new possibilities of utilisation for these habitats, the focus for new agricultural biomass should be on grasslands. But also croplands can provide more renewable raw materials without endangering a sustainable agriculture, e.g. by implementing legumes in the crop rotation. To decide if a region can provide adequate amounts of raw material for a biorefinery, new raw material assessment procedures have to be developed. In doing so, involvement of farmers is inevitable to generate a reliable study of the biomass refinery potentials.";"Franka Papendiek

The extension of the productive area denotes the hard strokes of the intensive anthropization of the land, in one of the most beautiful and evocative places in the Gulf. This undefined stretch of coast is the only one to be left undeveloped in the area and it still evokes the original natural landscape. The rigorous and elementary geometry of the industrial area defines the rules of the various buildings as an inevitable emanation. The buildings are designed with the same logic “box” of the urbanity production, made up of many hangers. The disposition of the buildings is also influenced by the irregular and indented coastline and by the will to define a visual screen against industrial settlements and buildings. A distinguishing characteristic marks the uniqueness and rarity of this project: a large blue canopy, suspended in the sky, hovering and resting on buildings, setting the whole complex in a unitary gesture, otherwise fragmented. It is simultaneously a dividing line and threshold, giving evidence to the area of transition between the city and the industrial-technological trade fair grounds, between the city’s architecture and the nature of the sea, between the shadows and the light. It’s an introductory episode, as the doorway and threshold, emphasizing the “brackets”, the exceptional nature of this settlement, the “window”, from which we can look into and see out of it, depending on ones point of view.</p>";"Claudio Zanirato";"";"Centro di Ateneo per le Biblioteche dell'Università di Napoli Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-06-30";"en;es;fr;it";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/2281-4574/2054";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tria.unina.it/index.php/tria/about/submissions";"15"

The city of Sari in Iran, like many other cities is not immune from these changes. The city population has increased by 16 times over the last fifty years. Therefore, the increasing population growth has created uncontrolled physical expansion in the city. In order to prevent these inefficiencies of urban problems, the present study was accomplished to determine the factors influencing the process of expanding the city of Sari and to find out some solutions to fix and prevent this process. The method used in this study, descriptive–analytical method, to data analysis and Heldern and Shannon entropy model were used. The results show that: 82% of the physical growth of the city during the period 1977-2005 was related to the population growth and the remaining 18 percent, was associated with the horizontal growth. The city sprawl, the metropolitan area of the city had denser structure and the surrounding areas had a more dispersed structure. Also the effects of synthetic and natural factors restricting the city of Sari physical development made the city exorbitance horizontal and linearly developed. According to the findings that could help prevent the horizontal development of the city, it could be said that we could make the city vertically developed rather than horizontal expansion, improvement and renovation of old texture of implementation and more use of the land, filling the empty spaces.";"Mohammad Mehdi Nasiri Khalili

Rapid increase in the urban areas is the major driver in landscape dynamics with the significant erosion in the quality and quantity of the natural ecosystems. The urban expansion process hence needs to be monitored, quantified and understood for effective planning and the sustainable management of natural resources. Cities and towns have been experiencing considerable growth in urban area, population size, social aspects, negative environmental and geographical inﬂuence, and complexity. Mumbai, the commercial capital of India, has experienced a spurt in infrastructural and industrial activities with globalization and opening up of Indian markets. Unplanned urbanization has resulted in dispersed growth inperi-urban pockets due to socio-economic aspects with the burgeoning population of the city. Consequent to this, there has been an uneven growth pattern apart from the increase in slums in and around the city. This has necessitated the understanding of the urbanization pattern and process focusing especially on the expanding geographical area, its geometry and the spatial pattern of its development. This communication discusses the urban footprint dynamics of Mumbai using multi-temporal remote sensing data with spatial metrics. Land use analysis indicated a decrease of vegetation by 20% with an increase in urban extent by 155% during the last three decades. Landscape metrics aided in assessing the spatial structure and composition of the urban footprints through the zonal analysis by dividing the region into four zones with concentric circles of 1 km incrementing radius from the city centre. The study reveals a significant variation in the composition of the urban patch dynamics with increasing complexity and aggregation of urban area at the centre and sprawl at the outskirts. Shannon’s entropy further confirms of sprawl with time. Further zoning with the circular gradients aided in understanding the transition process of land use categories into urban patch.

esaminare la dipendenza spaziale dei prezzi delle abitazioni. I dati sono desunti dai prezzi delle transazioni relativi al 2009, riferite all’edilizia abitativa nella Tainan Metropolis. La Tainan Metropolis è una nuova metropoli formata dalla fusione dell'ex Tainan City e di Tainan County. In seguito alla fusione delle municipalità verranno adeguati i confini amministrativi e, nel frattempo, è opportuno individuare i sottomercati spaziali dei prezzi delle abitazioni nell'area metropolitana in relazione ai sottomercati relativi ai precedenti confini amministrativi. Si è constatato che i prezzi più alti delle abitazioni sono concentrati nella zona del centro della città, mentre i prezzi più bassi sono diffusi soprattutto nell'anello esterno al centro della città di Tainan Metropolis. Nella sperimentazione dell’autocorrelazione spaziale dei prezzi delle abitazioni, si è rilevato che si riscontrava una significativa dipendenza spaziale tra i prezzi delle case. I risultati della modellazione dei prezzi delle abitazioni mostrano che i sottomercati spaziali derivati da tecniche di autocorrelazione spaziale hanno impatti più forti e più significativi sui prezzi delle case, inoltre, rispetto ai due modelli alternativi, il modello ha una migliore goodness-of-fit.

Likewise, the individuals of a community, city or neighbourhood present specific behavioural patterns and uses with respect to their public green areas. This premise has led us to explore the question of how the perceptions, uses, and behaviours of people from different countries, cultures, and socioeconomic levels in Chile, Germany and Spain differ or coincide as far as urban nature and landscapes are concerned. Due to the comparative nature of the project, research areas with similar characteristics were chosen, thus allowing a comparative analysis of upper and lower middle-class neighbourhoods. People from all six study areas were surveyed using the same questionnaires. The results revealed that people of different social and cultural backgrounds use and perceive urban landscape in different ways. We found that nature of different kind plays an important role in all the urban societies and particularly in the neighbourhoods studied, regardless of social status or nationality. However, the higher the social status, the greater the urban green area dedicated to private uses. The preference for specific types of nature depends not only on social status, but cultural elements, accessibility and tradition as well. Moreover, nature-related outdoor activities are defined by this status, in turn reflecting the individual’s cultural status within society.";"C. Priego

Our construction of the walkability in the model proposes a certain change of perspective with regard to the methods suggested thus far: rather than evaluating how a place is walkable in itself, the walkability score we calculate reflects how and where to one can walk from that place, in other words, what is the walkability the place is endowed with. Therefore, the walkability score combines three components: (1) the number of available destinations (urban “opportunities”) reachable by foot; (2) their distances; and (3) the quality of pedestrian routes towards those destinations. The quality of pedestrian routes is evaluated on different attributes relevant for walkability, related to the characteristics of the streets and their surrounding environment which contribute to render the route pleasant, secure and attractive. By way of example, in the third part we present an example application on the city of Alghero (Italy).";"Ivan Blečić

The objective factors that led to the emergence of various models of the land system, include socio-economic, historical, ethnic, cultural, natural and other features of different countries and peoples that inhabit them.

During 1991-2016 years,Ukraineestablished basics of a new land order and the respective land relations and the system of market-oriented land use, especially in agriculture. It is characterized by: a new legal and regulatory framework, different types of ownership of land and other natural resources, a multi-structure and paid land use, providing public with land parcels, initiated the establishment of a market-oriented system of state land cadastre, including registration of land parcels and rights to them. So, modern land transformations in Ukraine, which laid the basics of a new land order, requires the development of new approaches to land use management at different hierarchical levels of general land planning throughout the country.

It caused by many reasons. Primarily: setting the state boundaries and bounds of administrative units; development of different types of land ownership; increased numbers of new landowning and land tenure of citizens, enterprises, institutions and associations up to more than 23 million; need for separation of state and municipal property for land; establishment of payment for land use; specification of legal and functional status of land and of various restrictions, encumbrances and easements to each individual land parcel.

It is hard to overemphasize the importance of work on land-use planning at different hierarchical levels and general land management in modern conditions. Particularly acute need of land planning in urban and agricultural land use sectors of the country. Thus, the strategic development of land reforms and bringing them to a new level - the volume and long-term task that requires scientific substantiation of a rational state land policy.

The study justified that the land order - a land system, i.e. a set of measures for the territorial organization of land and other natural resources of the country, land relations, that is determined by system of ownership and use of land, as well as by the principles of organization of territory. In the process of land reform the land system have been changed several times: from the system of administrative-territorial division and respective to it forms of land use and methods of land use (collective and state farms) as of year 1990, to the system of the administrative-territorial division with the respective forms of land ownership (state, collective, private) and the forms and methods of land use (collective and state farms, collective farms, peasant (farmer) farms, subsidiary farms, collective gardens, agricultural research institutions, subsidiary agriculture enterprices, etc.) as of 1991 - 2001.

As of the 2002 - 2016 , the land order in Ukraine was defined: by the natural-resource-based division and natural-economic-based division (zoning); by the administrative-territorial division; by the forms of land ownership (state, municipal, property of foreign countries, co-ownership, private ownership of individuals and of legal entities); by the forms and methods of land use (for example, in agriculture there were the non-state agricultural enterprises such as collective, cooperative, corporate (agricultural holdings), companies, private-rental farms, subsidiary farms, private (family and individual), state and municipal scientific research and others). Today, due to the decentralization of power, the new model for land order is developed, which will be presented in subsequent studies.";"A. Tretiak

So on lands subjected to water erosion stopped work on land management on contour reclamation of the territory. To overcome negative degradation processes that occur Land Resources of Ukraine propnuyetsya apply restrictions in land use, the formation of which provide protection and rational use of land resources, limiting economic activity (which leads to negative changes in the state of land and the development of adverse processes) and sustainable land use.

The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 paralyzed the global economy, creating a strong diminishing trust in financial services and in the banking system in general. One of the most revolutionary systems to get funded in the market has been crowdfunding, a way of financing coming directly from the crowd through the Internet.
Crowdfunding in real estate started in 2012 with the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act (JOBS Act) in USA and has been developing at a fast rate every year.
In Italy, crowdfunding for real estate projects is not allowed yet, but there are various platforms that are already using the concept in different ways.
Real Estate Crowdfunding could represent an interesting opportunity for private individual to have an exposure to direct real estate investments.

First, the problem of separation (division) of land in terms of the scientific approach should be solved using the methods of discrete mathematics, cluster analysis methods, theory-busting and other methods of mathematical statistics. Second, approaches to separation (division) of land associated with the peculiarities of the functions that the earth takes in society, the selected criteria for the classification of land, which in turn can not be absolute and uniform for all occasions.

from nature. Structures and functions of ecosystems needed to sustain the provision of ecosystem services are altered
by various human activities. In this paper, a concept for the assessment of multiple ecosystem services is proposed
as a basis for discussion and further development of a respective evaluation instrument. Using quantitative and
qualitative assessment data in combination with land cover and land use information originated from remote sensing
and GIS, impacts of human activities can be evaluated. The results reveal typical patterns of different ecosystems‘
capacities to provide ecosystem services. The proposed approach thus delivers useful integrative information for
environmental management and landscape planning, aiming at a sustainable use of services provided by nature. The
research concept and methodological framework presented here for discussion have initially been applied in different
case studies and shall be developed further to provide a useful tool for the quantification and spatial modelling of
multiple ecosystem services in different landscapes. An exemplary application of the approach dealing with food
provision in the Halle-Leipzig region in Germany is presented. It shows typical patterns of ecosystem service distribution
around urban areas. As the approach is new and still rather general, there is great potential for improvement,
especially with regard to a data-based quantification of the numerous hypotheses, which were formulated as base for
the assessment. Moreover, the integration of more detailed landscape information on different scales will be needed
in future in order to take the heterogeneous distribution of landscape properties and values into account. Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to foster critical discussions on the methodological development presented here.";"Benjamin Burkhard

This was attempted with the elaboration of the 'Planwerk Innenstadt', a structural land use plan for central Berlin covering an area of 30 km2. The urbanism and architecture practised in the last decade reflect the rigid and conservative aesthetics and inflexible guidelines of traditional European townbuilding, set up by the plan and the Senate. Consequently, most ideas and projects of modern urban or architectural expression were left aside, whereas the interests of a globalised real estate market with anonymous international developers prevailed.";"Subotić Snežana";"";"Institute of Architecture and Urban & Spatial Planning of Serbia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2002-12-31";"sr";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"";"http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0354-6055/2002/0354-60550211021S.pdf";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-SA";"http://scindeks.ceon.rs/PublicationPolicy.aspx?issn=0354-6055&lang=en#ppLC";"12"

The main objective of optimum utilization of land resources is a process of territorial organization, in which the need to apply the most effective option to use the whole complex of land resources for the greatest productive potential of agricultural land.

The concept of ""productive potential"" is considered as the combination of characteristics of land and natural conditions, shaped by human society, and determine the nature of the rational use of land in the area of expanded reproduction. In general terms the maximum opportunity in the economy. The productive potential of land is not a sustainable figure. During the agricultural use of the land productive potential is constantly changing due to the gradual improvement or reduction of logistics, soil fertility and obtaining agricultural products.

The productive capacity of agricultural land is proposed to assess the following indicators: a qualitative characterization of soils and agricultural technologies. These indicators are as diverse comparative calculation to be posted in stages.

First of all, draws attention to the qualitative characteristics of the soil, which is the basis for growing crops. Data on basic indicators of soil to be correct and complex to define parameters of soil and expressed through generalized estimation of fertility. These figures are in agrochemical passport fields. The final calculation serves agrochemical and environmental agrochemical evaluation, filed in points.

Modern agricultural technologies is a complex process operations management processes productive crops in artificial ecosystems to achieve the forecasted yields and product quality while ensuring environmental safety and some economic efficiency. Number of applied agricultural technologies depends on the complexity of environmental conditions and the level of planned productivity. The more intense agricultural technologies, especially natural factors must be considered.

To improve performance and improvement of production in agriculture advanced countries in the world use precision agriculture. When used precision agriculture systems plant receives the amount of substances which it needs. By fertilizing spot, where they are needed, minimized costs of acquisition

Equally important set of measures aimed at improving the natural environment is reclamation. Thanks to the introduction of more productive land reclamation, increasing their resistance to adverse climatic conditions and creates an environment that best meets the requirements that are in agriculture.

Bet the use of productive potential site is reduced to an objective assessment of the environmental and economic interests and study the most effective ways to implement them.

Prevention of the costs of restoring soil quality and further increase the full net production effects that positively influence the formation of the productive potential of agricultural land.

Demographic change is thereby defined as both the decrease of the population and the shift in the age distribution („aging“) and in the spatial distribution („rural flight“ particularly of young people). The exploration of the research object is based on the starting hypothesis that the demands and preferences of an aging and urbanizing population are changing and have effects on the controlling state interventions, which are also reflected in the agricultural use of landscapes. After a short description of demographic change, a conceptual politico-economic model, which describes the transmission of demographic change on land use, through the analysis of group (age groups, groups of residences) demands on agrarian landscape use is presented. The focus is on the demand for land use related non-commodity outputs (NCO). The starting hypothesis is then examined using selected studies. The literature suggests that urban-rural dichotomy is likely to be greatly diminished. In addition, the urbanization of preferences is expected while preferences differentiated against heterogeneous cultural lifestyles seem to become even more important. However, without further research on the related topics, the basic issues cannot be clearly dealt with. Assumptions are finally made regarding changing societal demands for agrarian landscapes due to demographic change. The limitations of the selected approach and the identification of further research needs will be discussed in closing.";"K. Müller

Therefore, it is expedient to propose an author's vision regarding the essential definition of this concept. In the classical form, this term was used many decades ago and literally meant the ""foundation"", ""the foundation"". It has been established that balanced development of land management as a mechanism for the development of the socio-economic, ecological and legal system of land use in the respective territory is ensured by interaction between the whole set of conditions and factors that can be grouped according to qualitative characteristics in six blocks: 1) needs, development goals, developmental tasks ; 2) innovations in the development of land management and land management NTP for land use development; 3) state land policy, land policy of territorial communities; organizational structure of the land management system; 4) normative-legal infrastructure; 5) mentality, culture, public consciousness; 6) economic mechanism, system of social and economic development. Institutional provision of balanced development of land management and land management of territories of territorial communities is possible only if it is possible to achieve the coherence and complementarity of all six blocks and the unidirectionality of their development. Institutional provision of land management and land management at the local level is a set of social interests, elements, actions and institutions aimed at building land relations and land system systems that ensure the harmonious functioning of land use at the local and other hierarchical levels of economic development of the respective territories.

Thus, in agricultural land use should be understood natural and territorial complex, in which occurs interaction of economic agent with the environment, with the result that forming certain social product (agricultural products), and transformation of agricultural land use – a process of transformation of land use of present social and economic system in a new land use, which is characterized by changing the previous characteristics and properties  of land use to a new. At the same time, an important feature of the transformation is withering away of the previous system of economic relations. To determine, if effective occured transformation of agricultural land use, is necessary to conduct environmental and economic evaluation of the transformation of agricultural land use, where ecological and economic evaluation – evaluation of changes of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of agricultural land use as a result of type of social and economic relations and forms of land ownership. In the study suggested structural and logical scheme of transformation of agricultural land use based on formed concepts and statements. Determines the prerequisites of transformation of agricultural land use, based on private ownership of land, so to the main belongs changing of the type of social and economic relations, forms of ownership of land and means of production, the poor state of the environment. As a result of transformation of agricultural land use at market conditions, occured transition from land use of state and collective farms to agricultural formations of market type, зbased on different forms of ownership In the study highlighted the stages of transformation and classification of types of transformation of agricultural land use.

Based on the concept of ""transformation of agricultural land use"" recommended to carry out classification of it’s types: by the result - effective, moderately effective and ineffective; by duration - short, medium and long-term; by the way impact of external and internal factors - evolution, revolutionary; within the meaning of preconditions – economic, social, environmental, political, military and others.

Described stages of transformation of agricultural land use, namely: first - imbalance second - unstable and uncertain state; coexistence between forms; third - the establishment of stability and dominance of the new system; fourth - arising of equilibrium state; fifth - post-transformational. The result of of transformation of agricultural land use is the emergence of agricultural formations of  market type based on various forms of ownership.

In the article analyzes experience of transformation forms of ownership of land in countries such as: Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, where land privatization was carried out by restitution and immediately had the opportunity to freely dispose of land. This had a positive impact on the rapid recovery of agricultural production after the establishment of a market economy. But in Ukraine the land was equally distributed among rural population, much of which has never conducted an independent business that has affected the efficiency of agricultural production.

After transformation of land relations in our state occurred redistribution of lands between the categories of landowners and land users. The main land users were newly established agricultural enterprises, farms, private farms and citizens for agricultural commodity production. The specific of transformation was the concentration of agricultural land in large agricultural enterprises, which are the main producers of agricultural products and services and in fact - legal successors of collective farms and state farms with employees.

However, how this knowledge will foster decisions that lead to more desirable outcomes and analyses necessary to transition to sustainability remains a critical theoretical and empirical question for basic and applied research. We argue that we are still underestimating the tendency to lock into certain patterns that come at the cost of the ability to adjust to new situations. This rigidity limits the ability of persons, groups, and companies to respond to new problems, and can make it hard to learn new facts because we pre-select facts as important, or not, in line with our established values. Changing circumstances demand to reappraise values like in the case of Pirsig’s monkey and its rice. There is an urgent need to go beyond such local, static and short-term conceptions, where landscape sustainability has been incorrectly envisioned as a durable, stable condition that, once achieved, could persist for generations. We argue that to manage a global transition toward more environmentally efficient and, therefore, more sustainable land-use we have to reappraise societal values at the root of overregulation and rigidity.";"Zurlini Giovanni

to test hypotheses regarding how different species of longhorned beetles likely connect habitats with dispersal.
We predicted that there would be differences in the functional connectivity of landscapes depending on species
larval niche breadth, adult feeding habits, and the potential for use of non-forest habitats. For the species with very
specialized larvae, we developed a classification tree to determine areas likely to contain the appropriate species of
host tree. Connectivity calculated using least cost paths did not out-perform Euclidean distances for three generalist
beetles. This was also the case for the specialist beetle species when all forest was considered habitat. However,
when we delineated habitat based on areas likely to support the host tree the functional connectivity incorporating
least cost paths was a much better predictor than that using Euclidean distances. Generalists may respond to
fragmented habitat in a binary habitat-matrix way while more specialized species may respond to a mosaic. These
trends are obscured if habitat is defined by human perceptions rather than species biology.";"Carolyn J. Foley

The two projects strictly integrate the urban transformation projects in the implementation of the mobility system. The two societies that realize the project are Bagnolifutura SpA Urban Transformation Society, and Ansaldo STS SpA. The first has the task to act the executive urban plan of Bagnoli-Coroglio; the latter is one of the main company in the global railway &amp; mass transit transportation systems and it is licenseed for design and construction of the line nr 6. The paper, in the whole complex process, wants to analyze particularly the long coordination process among the subjects responsible for the various design and construction phases and the equally hard work necessary for the granting of approvals. In other words, the paper wants to show that the expected and/or obtained results in terms of land-transport integration come not only from a rigorous design process, but mainly from a structured, long and often difficult activity of technical consensus building. For this result many meetings are necessary , field tests, surveys, expert analysis, but also the definite time for closing the significant phases of the procedure, avoiding the risk of indefinite times for discussion, never compatible with the timing of the funding. The definition of the trackwork, for example, is a synthesis moment of many requirements that must be met; their acceptance is never immediate, but it is verified only after a recursive process that assembles one after the other the pieces of a mosaic. It is a team effort involving multiple disciplines and a large number of professionals; they must work in close contact, making sure that the information&rsquo;s flow in the right way, that the taken decisions are transparent, clear, and that are known to all; everyone must have the availability to revise some of the own work or, in extreme cases, to restart the process. A necessary first step of comparison has involved the layout of the railway line and the level of the track. During several meetings, audits, and technical evaluation stages, a series of design alternatives are studied, and are discarded all the hypotheses of trenches or close to the ground parts. The only possible choice was the creation of a tunnel starting from Campegna, that continues along the Sport Park, reaches Steel Mill, Science City and the Park Gate, serving the nodal points in the area. Among others, two engineering aspects are faced in the project&rsquo;s development: the provision of electricity and water for the metro line, and the interference of the line with a large sewer pipe in the area. Another aspect is the integration between the architecture and the landscape as regards the stations and the gateways, with particular attention to the industrial archeology buildings.</p>";"Carmela Fedele

many taxa on large peninsulas. Peninsula effects are caused by differences in colonization and extinction predicted
by island biogeography or by environmental gradients along the peninsula. We compared species-area regressions
for cove patches (i.e., mainland) to regressions for lobe patches (i.e., on peninsula tips) for wet meadow birds
along a highly interdigitated shoreline (northern Lake Huron, USA). We conducted analysis both with and without
accounting for variation in habitat and landscape characteristics (i.e., environmental gradients) of wet meadows.
Species-area regressions for coves did not differ from lobes, nor did these results differ when we accounted for
gradients. Similarly, few species were more abundant in coves. Peninsula effects may have been lacking because
lobe patches were located ≈ 800 m on average from the mainland, and birds are highly mobile and can easily
sample patches over these distances. One important caveat was that wet meadow patches > 5 ha were located in
coves, so coves would still be important considerations in conservation plans because of the contribution of large
patches to reproductive success, dispersal and population dynamics. ";"Sam Riffell

"DOAJ:c1a28f65a1a94f3980c70fca05c3a2ae";"THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS EFFICIENT MASS VALUATION";"";" In the article the theoretical basis for determining the effectiveness of mass valuation of land in present-day conditions are described. The concept defenitsy effect and effectiveness as economic categories and their classification values for mass valuation of land are presented.              The effectiveness of mass valuation of land in the settlements defines the structure of local budget and economic activities undertaken by local authorities on the basis of the results of the mass appraisal of real estate.            Mass valuation is regular and it is characterized by high degree of standardization of procedures and a significant increase in the role of statistical methods for processing data related to the use of the most significant factors influencing the parameters of the object to its cost, as well as the need to determine the value of the objective laws change equivalent, which is only possible when using economic and mathematical methods and statistical analysis. Quality control results of mass valuation carried out principally in other ways, as obtained by applying statistical machine results can be checked as soon statistical methods. This shows the relevance of research topic and lack of elaboration for Ukraine problems of efficiency of mass land valuation.
Scientific research conducted through the use of the dialectical method and techniques of abstraction, comparative analysis and synthesis, the article various models and methods of valuation of land for taxation purposes are analyzed. In addition, the group explored methods used, comparisons, and more.

In economic theory and practice problems and determine the effect of efficiency aimed at profit is quite relevant. Economists consider cost-effectiveness, such as economic efficiency. In this case, the production can be attributed to the activities to conduct and organization of mass valuation of land. This pushes many different positions on criteria and indicators of economic efficiency, the composition of results and consideration of cost, given different definitions of efficiency and offered various ways to measure. The question of social, environmental and other efficiency are considered generally as elements that complement economic efficiency.

For land evaluation work efficiency are the following types: economic (increase in tax collection and tax payments); ecological (removal of the negative impact on the earth, the environment); social (improvement of living conditions of the population in a particular area); information (identifying objects not previously recorded, increasing the number of taxpayers).

Achieving economic or social effect due to the need for ongoing and one-time costs. The ongoing related costs included in cost of production.

In order to improve the efficiency of monetary value of land mass based methods, in our view, to apply emergency measures to correct the situation in the monetary evaluation assessments, namely:

 - need to develop clear and understandable regulations for the implementation of mass land valuation, passage of expertise, information and other aspects of the implementation of inventory and evaluation work;

- should develop new or significantly alter already existing methods so that they meet the requirements of international law, international standards of evaluation, and allow the user to understand the simple manufacturing process works;

- appraiser who performs the mass appraisal should be fully independent and protected by law from public authorities.";"Koshel A.";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-08-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"UKR";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/7260/7037";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"5"

As the program was streamlined to fit the different agro-climatic condition of the country, the extension approach practiced in the Tigray region (research area) was called Integrated Household Extension Program.

Aim: This article reports on research aimed at measuring the technical efficiency levels of extension participants and non-participants; measuring the impact extension service on technical efficiency.

Setting: The research was conducted in the northern part of the country, where agriculture is the main sources of livelihoods. Moisture is the most critical factor in the production system. The land holding size averages 0.5 ha per household compared to above three ha 30 years ago; indicating the high population pressure in the area.

Methods: A sample of 362 agricultural extension service participants and 369 non-participant farm households from the northern part of Ethiopia, participated in the study. The stochastic production frontier technique was used to analyse the survey data and to compute farm-level technical efficiency.

Results: The results showed an average level of technical efficiency of 48%. It is suggested that substantial gains in output and/or decrease in cost can be attained with the existing technology. All the variables included in the model to explain efficiency were found significant and with the expected sign, except education and number of dependants.

Conclusion: The research tried to assess the impact of a new extension service (participatory in nature) on farmers’ productivity in a semi-arid zone, as compared with the conventional extension service and found in the literature areas with relatively better climatic conditions. Hence, if extension administrators could work to uplift the average and below average farmers into better performing farmers level, the overall production and living condition could improve substantially in the research area, and more or less in the rest part of the country.";"Kidanemariam Gebrehiwot";"";"University of Pretoria";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2017-06-30";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ETH";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajems.v20i1.1349";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"";"";""

This is an important subject, since the study of changes in plots value in space and time enables the evaluation of urban rent, which is essential for a fair and effective planning. The analysis confirm past hypothesis which are well known to real estate market operators. The first resulting fact is that the changes in building plots value are concurrent to those in real estate value and the increase occurring in the last years is in relative terms higher than the past one. This seems to confirm that, during real estate market expansion, most of the increase of buildings’ value is attributable to the land rent. The second observation is about value dynamics over time: it has been observed that, during an expansion in demand, the value significantly increases in central areas, much more than in peripheral ones; this means that absolute rent arising from
shortage in urban areas is higher than the differential rent created through urban expansion in peripheral areas. Finally, it was highlighted that the factors affecting the value in building areas play different roles, depending on their location relative to the urban centre, identifying differently structured market segments.";"Paolo Rosato";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-12-31";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_2_14_1e";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"9"

However, the most commonly used concept to relate pattern to process in landscape ecology, the so-called patch-corridor-matrix model, perceives the landscape as a planimetric surface. As a consequence, landscape metrics, used as numerical descriptors of the spatial arrangement of landscape mosaics, generally do not allow for the examination of terrain characteristics and may even produce erroneous results, especially in mountainous areas. This brief methodological study provides basic approaches to include relief  properties into large-scale landscape analyses, including the calculation of standard landscape metrics on the basis of “true” surface geometries and the application of roughness parameters derived from surface metrology. The methods are tested for their explanatory power using neutral landscapes and simulated elevation models. The results reveal that area and distance metrics possess a high sensitivity to terrain complexity, while the values of shape metrics change only slightly when surface geometries are considered for their calculation. In summary, the proposed methods prove to be a valuable extension of the existing set of metrics mainly in “rough” landscape sections, allowing for a more realistic assessment of the spatial structure";"S.

While changes in the planning process are aimed at mechanisms for urgent action in the transformed circumstances in the sense of a deeper understanding of the causes of phenomena and prediction of future changes, modification of specific measures suppose to be related to the regulatory framework for new and existing construction that will lead to reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and the development of resistance to settlements' extreme impacts. The focus has shifted to land-use planning and the development and application of building regulations. It is considered that planning at the local level is an appropriate instrument for solving the problem of climate impacts in the community. In general, urban planning is an instrument of implementation of national strategies for mitigation and adaptation at the local level. Successful implementation of the strategy is based on a developed vertical and horizontal institutional and procedural coordination. In the circumstances of specific context of post-socialist urban restructuring, which is characterized by a lack of developed institutions and appropriate procedures, it is difficult to expect the entire application of prescribed procedures and harmonization of vertical and horizontal spatial development policies. Accordingly, it is recommended that policies be aimed at short-term improvements that are based on existing climate risk management and short-term projections of climate impacts. Among the main recommendations of the regional climate change adaptation strategies related to policy-makers in the field of urban development is to establish new and efficient use of existing legislation in the field of environment and planning. It is believed that most countries in the region have adequate legislation and efforts should be directed towards more effective implementation of existing planning and building regulations especially in areas exposed to climate impacts. In the absence of a national strategy of adaptation to climate change, urban planning guidelines could be determined by comparative analysis of regional recommendations in the field of urban planning and the existing legislative framework in Serbia.";"Maruna Marija";"";"Institute of Architecture and Urban & Spatial Planning of Serbia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2012-12-31";"sr";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"SRB";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.5937/arhurb1236050M";"http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0354-6055/2012/0354-60551236050M.pdf";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-SA";"http://scindeks.ceon.rs/PublicationPolicy.aspx?issn=0354-6055&lang=en#ppLC";"6"

The phenomenon was particularly pronounced in the period spanning 1990-2007, when the construction of housing on a mass scale was a clear indicator of the second circuit of capital accumulation, with space playing a key role through the work of David Harvey. This led to a property bubble – one of the defining features of the economic and financial crisis in Spain between 2008 and 2013. In this contribution to the subject, we analyse the factors that triggered unchecked speculative urban growth in the context of the financialization of land.

This is a main issue, since it affects the evaluation of developed lands as well as investment properties under construction. The lack of data is one of the difficulties encountered in the evaluation process. The assessor may happen to face lacking data in a market segment even in a transparent market. Unlike exact science observations, real estate information is not repeatable, either in time or space. Therefore, approaches providing value judgments, even with low amount of information, are scientifically and professionally effective. This paper describes the operating application of a procedure called MCA, used to determine the estimating equation through a low number of comparable data (D’Amato, 2015), to a reduced data table for the prediction of the placement value of properties under construction. Starting with the MCA application, the estimating equation is determined by using procedures for the determination of marginal prices (Simonotti, 1997). This application concerns the determination of the estimating equation related to the residential apartment market in Santo Spirito district in Bari.";"Maurizio d’Amato";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2015-06-30";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_2_15_3e";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"11"

The modern system of planning land- use in Ukraine now is not formed and balanced and does not provide positive results in achieving its high economic efficiency and environmental safety. Territorial planning of land use wasn’t needed by system of state and municipal administration because there are problems in the territorial land management which are related with insufficient compliance current needs of sustainable development. If planning of development in the cities (towns) is developed and makes of base planning documentation (general plans) then the area of land ownership and land use outside towns isn’t covered completely creation of land documents.

        In Ukraine in most scientific research view separate aspects of influence territorial use of planning the spatial organization of economic activities of local communities.

        For the new community situation in use land and natural resources became difficult, first of all through:

-underestimation of the complexity and specificity of land reform during land and economic reforms in Ukraine;

- local community hasn’t full information about  rights to land and other natural resources, their potential use and protection of the state;

- incompetence of system solving problems of land reform in the local councils, for example : remove communities from order of land in their territories, lands of state and municipal property aren’t separated, land reform and land tenure systems, especially in agriculture are incomplete;

- unsatisfactory legal and information support and protection of property rights of villagers to land and other natural resources;

- ignoring the problems of putting into economic turnover of land as a capital resource and integrated approach to village territories in  development  the transformation of land relations, absence of a balanced state land politics of planning of land use and land management with local communities and mechanisms of its implementation;

- lack of consistent state politics for the integrated development of land legislation, conduct and financing of state and municipal land management and land cadastre, formation of investment-attractive land-use;

- very poor information infrastructure of the land market and the lack of a balanced public politics formation and development of the non-agricultural land and agricultural use;

- lack of information ensuring for rural population about questions of opportunities for use of land and other natural resources in their territories in market conditions;

        This can be realised through the Program use and protection of land and natural resources in the community.

        As a result of their realization we can get:

- increase the investment attractiveness and efficiency of use potential of land and other natural resources, environmental security of land tenure;

- rationalization (optimization) of land use and creation of investment-attractive and sustainable land-use;

- improving the efficiency of land lease, especially in the agricultural and recreational facilities;

The programme has the potential to contribute to the simultaneous achievement of three goals to which South Africa is committed, namely: • job creation, • broad-based black economic empowerment, and • achieving expressed conservation and environmental objectives. The programme is currently being developed in the form of two ongoing pilot projects that, taken together, employ 576 previously jobless people, have created several small enterprises, and are beneficially affecting thousands of hectares of severely degraded land in South Africa’s rural areas (EOI2, 2006). The programme may be categorised in the context of South Africa’s economy as either “economic development” through poverty alleviation and in future perhaps part of the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP), and clearly has the potential to enable people in South Africa’s rural areas to make the transition from the “second” (informal) to the “first” (formal) economy.

"DOAJ:12f86765a51a40208e6f418e05cdc22f";"THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF EVALUATION OF EFFICIENCY OF SOIL CONSERVATION MEASURES IN AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE ";"";"In the article modern scientific and theoretical positions concerning determination of the effectiveness of soil protection measures on agricultural lands are investigated.

It is analyzed that the protection of land from degradation is one of the most important problems of agriculture, as this process leads to a significant decrease in soil fertility and crop yields. That is why in today's conditions, when the protection of agricultural land became urgent and a priority task, the scientific substantiation of the economic assessment of the damage caused by the degradation of land to agriculture, as well as the development of methods for determining the economic efficiency of the most progressive soil protection measures, technologies and complexes based on their overall Comparative evaluation.

It was established that ground protection measures are a system of various measures aimed at reducing the negative degradation effect on the soil cover and ensuring the preservation and reproduction of soil fertility and integrity, as well as increasing their productivity as a result of rational use.

The economic essence of soil protection measures is the economic effect achieved by preventing damage caused by land degradation to agriculture, as well as for obtaining additional profit as a result of their action.

The economic effectiveness of soil protection measures means their effectiveness, that is, the correlation between the results and the costs that they provided. The excess of the economic result over the cost of its achievement indicates the economic efficiency of soil protection measures, and the difference between the result and the expenditure characterizes the economic effect.

Ecological efficiency is characterized by environmental parameters of the soil cover, namely: the weakening of degradation effects on soils; improvement of their qualitative properties; An increase in production without violation of environmental standards, etc.

Economic efficiency reflects the use of land resources when performing soil protection requirements.

Social efficiency is determined by the improvement of social organizational and territorial conditions of population living: preventing losses of clean products due to soil contamination; reduction of payments from the social insurance fund; Reduction of expenses of the society for treatment of workers in connection with pollution of soils, etc.

When introducing soil protection measures, a soil protection effect is necessary under the condition of an increase in productive capacity of the land only if it is differentiated according to the soil, relief, climatic conditions and specialization of agricultural enterprises with the obligatory application of anti-degradation measures. Therefore, in today's environment, the organization and planning of soil protection measures should take place on the basis of a regional program-targeted approach. Its essence consists in analyzing the initial state of the region, identifying problems and formulating the goal, identifying their priorities. This makes it possible to make an effective decision on the implementation of an optimal set of soil protection measures.

Consequently, the general criteria for the economic evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of soil protection measures are the preservation and improvement of the qualitative characteristics of agricultural land and the environment and the increase of production per unit of land at the least cost.

Indicators of economic efficiency of various types of soil protection measures play an important role in the design and implementation of soil protection measures against degradation. With the proposed approaches, the relevant bodies of land relations, in particular, when developing projects and other documentation on land management, as well as directly landowners and land users, can reasonably plan some or other measures and allocate the necessary material resources for their implementation. This ensures the restoration of degraded lands and the timely prevention of degradation processes.";"Shevchenko O.";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2017-08-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/9517/8524";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"6"

can be quantified by using indices related to the patch-corridor-matrix model. This model conceptualizes
landscapes as planar mosaics consisting of discrete patches. On the other hand, relief variability is a key factor for
many ecological processes, and therefore these processes can be better modeled by integrating information concerning
the third dimension of landscapes. This can be done by generating a triangle mesh which approximates
the original terrain. The aim of this methodological paper is to introduce two new constructions of triangulations
which replace a digital elevation model. These approximation methods are compared with the method which was
already used in the computation of 3D-landscape metrics (firstly for parameterized surfaces and secondly for two
landscape mosaics). The statistical analysis shows that all three methods are of almost equal sensitivity in reflecting
the relationship between terrain ruggedness and the patches areas and perimeters. In particular, either of the methods
can be used for approximating the real values of these basic metrics. However, the two methods introduced
in this paper have the advantage of yielding continuous approximations of the terrain, and this fact could be useful
for further developments. ";"M.-S. Stupariu

Taiwanese businesses have gradually turned to develop in China under the pressure of increasing domestic wages and land costs for expanding factories as well as the enhancement of environmental protection. Mainland China presents the advantages of ample land, low labor costs, monoethnicity, and easy language communication making it an attractive major investment location for Taiwanese high-tech industries. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to measure overseas investment efficiency evaluation of Taiwanese high-tech businesses in China, where the Delphi Method is used for selecting the inputs of the number of employees, R&D expenses, and gross sales in total assets. Sensitivity Analysis is further utilized for acquiring the most efficient unit and individual units with operating efficiency. The research results show that 1.Three high-tech businesses that present constant returns to scale perform optimally with overseas investment efficiency 2.Two high-tech companies with decreasing returns to scale appear that they could improve the overseas investment efficiency by decreasing the scale to enhancing the marginal returns, and 3.Sixteen high-tech enterprises reveal increasing returns to scale, showing that they could expand the scale to enhance the marginal returns and further promote efficiency.";"Ridong Hu

Drawing on multi-sited empirical research, we argue that the recognition and valorization of custom and common property management is a prerequisite for sustainable and equitable land tenure reform in Timor-Leste. In a four-community study of the relationship between land access and the practice of rural livelihoods in eastern and western districts of Timor-Leste, where customary management systems are dominant, we found different types of traditional dispute resolution, with deep roots in traditional forms of land management and with varying levels of conflict. The article shows how customary land tenure systems have already managed to create viable moral economies. Interviewees expressed a desire for the government to formalize its recognition and support for customary systems and to provide them with basic livelihood support and services. This was more important than instituting private landholding or state appropriation of community lands, which is perceived to be the focus of national draft land laws and an internationally supported project. We suggest ways in which diverse customary institutions can co-exist and work with state institutions to build collective political legitimacy in the rural hinterlands, within the context of upgrading the quality of rural life, promoting social and ecological harmony, and conflict management.";"Simon P.J.

"DOAJ:d8f3787de24a486f8589f5ff91d8fec3";"Micro-enterprise predicament in township economic development: Evidence from Ivory Park and Tembisa";"";"Background: In South Africa, the idea that the township economy needs to be ‘revitalised’ has begun to gain significant political traction. The Gauteng provincial government has responded to this challenge by setting out a strategy that promises to channel resources and create opportunities for micro-enterprises. The paper responds to development interventions such as this through interrogating the nature of the challenges facing micro-enterprises that need to be overcome in South African townships.
Aim: In response to the developmental need to stimulate micro-enterprise growth in South African townships, the paper poses the question: what approaches are most likely to have a positive impact on township businesses, given current micro-enterprise dynamics?

Setting: Primary research was undertaken in two neighbouring townships in Gauteng province, in Ivory Park and Tembisa.

Methods: The data comprises a geospatial census of enterprise activities, a survey of select firms and qualitative interviews with business owners. The research utilised a small-area census approach to obtain data on business activities within an area of approximately 2km2 in each site. The census enumerated 2509 micro-enterprises in Ivory Park and 1722 micro-enterprises in Tembisa. Firm interviews were conducted with business owners in four sectors: grocery retail, liquor retail, hair care and early childhood development centres.

Results: The business census identifies a strong similarity in the structure of the townships’ informal micro-entrepreneurship despite the considerable differences in the socio-economic status of the respective case sites. The enterprise survey highlights the resource constraints of township businesses and thinness of local markets. Interviews with entrepreneurs reveal four main pathways through which individuals enter into self-employment with the most dynamic enterprises established by inward investing entrepreneurs. Spatial considerations exert an influence on the position of enterprise sectors, whilst access to land and business infrastructure are notable constraints.

Conclusion: Reflecting on the evidence, the paper concludes with making a call for a more low-geared development approach, focusing on lessening the legal, institutional and regulatory obstacles to enterprise growth as a first step. Municipalities have an important role in liberalising the spaces and places where township informal enterprises can and should be permitted to trade as well as creating a more favourable business environment. The challenges of crime and finance demand more purposeful action from the national government.";"Andrew Charman";"";"University of Pretoria";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2017-05-31";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ZAF;018";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajems.v20i1.1617";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"";"";""

Scenario results are further limited by roughly discriminated land use types at low spatial resolution or they are restricted to single sites and isolated crops. Here, we exemplify a well data based comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a drought endangered agrarian region in Northeast Germany using a 2050 climate scenario. Coherently modelled results on water balance and yields indicate that agricultural production may persist, whereas wetlands and groundwater production will be negatively affected. The average percolation rate decreases from 143 mm a-1 to 12 mm a-1, and the average yield decline broken down by crops ranges from 4% for summer wheat to 14% for potatoes (main cereals: 5%).";"H.

Il considère que les dynamiques à l’œuvre dans le processus de mondialisation (politiques néo-libérales, compétition territoriale, suburbanisation) conduisent à de nouvelles contraintes pesant sur les villes. Une des réponses les plus pertinentes que les villes peuvent générer repose sur le changement d’échelle de leurs institutions en bâtissant de nouvelles structures ou en les restructurant pour renforcer leur capacité d’action. Ce processus conduit à reconfigurer les modes de gouvernance et donc le pouvoir urbain sur de nouvelles bases géographiques. Ce type de manipulation territoriale est un instrument qui agit sur l’allocation des ressources entre acteurs, en inclus certains, en exclue d’autres, établit de nouvelles priorités sur l’agenda politique. Cinq types de dynamiques institutionnelles sont présentées et analysées à partir de cas concrets: 1) les villes fusionnées 2) le gouvernement à plusieurs niveaux 3) la coopération partagée 4) les communautés urbaines et 5) les villes non contiguës. Une première évaluation est menée en tentant de mettre jour l’efficacité, le contrôle démocratique et la capacité à générer du développement économique respectifs de ces cinq modèles qui présentent tous des avantages et des inconvénients. Le recours à l’un ou l’autre de ces modèles s’explique essentiellement par les valeurs auxquels il renvoie et par des contingences politiques et économiques. Ils ne garantissent pas non plus un type particulier d’effet même si un changement d’échelle bien maîtrisé peut renforcer la position d’une ville face à la mondialisation.<br>This article explores the relationship between globalization and urban rescaling. It suggests that forces emanating from globalization (neo liberal politics, increased competition, economic restructuring and suburbanization) have created new pressures on cities. One of the more effective responses cities can take is to re-scale their territories. Territorial re-scaling is defined as the remaking or the reconfiguration of land in order to exercise decisional and policy control. Re-scaling serves to restructure governance and ultimately power along particular geographical lines. This kind of territorial manipulation is a tool which can allocate power, include or exclude different actors, shape priorities and shrink or expand policy nets. Five types of re-scaling are specified as 1) consolidated jurisdictions 2) multi-tiered jurisdictions 3) linked jurisdictions 4) urban communities and 5) jumped scales. Each of these types is reviewed, explained and examples furnished. Also furnished is empirical evidence on the effects of different types of re-scaling with respect to their efficiency, democratic accountability and economic development. Each re-scaling has its advantages and disadvantages and no type is seen as necessarily “better” or “worse” than another. Much depends on the values being sought and the circumstances facing a city. Finally, there are no guarantees that a particular outcome will be attained, though skillful use of re-scaling can bolster a city’s position as it faces the challenges of globalization.";"H.V.

Traffic, environmental and economic problems arising from high growth of personal car, inappropriate distribution of land use, and car-orientation of metropolitan area, necessitate adoption of TOD. In recent years, more researches on urban development and transportation have focused on this strategy. This research considering metro stations as base for development, aims to model metro users' travel behavior and decision-making procedures. In this regard, research question is: what are the parameters or factors affecting in the frequency of travel by metro in half-mile radius from stations. The radius was determine based on TOD definitions and 5 minute walking time to metro stations.  A questionnaire was designed in three sections that including travel features by metro, attitudes toward metro, economic and social characteristics of respondents. Ten stations were selected based on their geographic dispersion in Tehran and a sample of 450 respondents was determined. The questionnaires were surveyed face to face in (half-mile) vicinity of metro stations. Based on a refined sample on 400 questionnaires ordered discrete choice models were considered. Results of descriptive statistics show that 38.5 percent of the sample used metro more than 4 times per week. Trip purpose for 45.7 percent of metro users is work. Access mode to the metro stations for nearly half of the users (47.6 percent) is bus. Results of ordered logit models show a number of significant variables including: habit of using the metro, waiting time in station, trip purpose (working, shopping and recreation), personal car access mode to the metro station, walking access mode to the metro station and being a housewife.";"Amir Reza Mamdoohi

Oltre alla mappa catastale e alla computerizzazione di tutti i terreni (catastali e ipotecari), la documentazione ha reso più affidabile, flessibile ed economico il sistema ipotecario e catastale e ha contribuito a mantenere per 200 anni una sorta di ordine sociale nell’ambito della proprietà fondiaria, facilitando così l’instaurarsi di un clima di fiducia.

The conflict occurred in the preparatory phase of a large-scale plantation, before any oil palms were planted. After protest from local communities, the project was abolished. This case enables an empirical enquiry of land tenure as well as the meaning of land and associated resources for people’s livelihoods in a pre-plantation situation. The article aims to understand how people’s responses to the oil palm plantation project are rooted in the way they give meaning to the land that is targeted for conversion. Using a functional analysis of property relations, the article shows that people value multiple functions of land, including food security, income security over generations, flexibility to respond to crises and opportunity, and the ability to retain autonomy and identity as farmers. One of the factors that contributed to the conflict was the expectation that a conversion of diversified agricultural land and forest into a monoculture plantation, run by a company, would change the functionality of land and associated resources in a way that would negatively impact livelihood opportunities, lifestyles, and identity.";"Rosanne E. de Vos";"";"Society for South-East Asian Studies";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-06-30";"de;en";"land conflicts";"Land Conflicts";"";"IDN";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14764/10.ASEAS-2016.1-2";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"http://www.seas.at/our-journal-aseas/";"21"

In addition to the cadastral map itself, the computerisation of all land, cadastral and mortgage, documentation has made the French cadastral and mortgage system more reliable, flexible and economical, and has contributed to maintaining a form of social order for 200 years in the area of land ownership.

A methodological proposal to support the Public Administration";"";"The paper presents a research project submitted to the MIUR (Ministry of Education, University and Research), in response to the Notice of PRIN (Scientific Research Programmes of Relevant National Interest) for the year 2012. The ""Fairness, Land register and territory government"" project addresses the core of property taxation and, in particular, how such fairness can be guaranteed in Italy only through a process of revision of the land register estimates. In Italy, in fact, land register values have been completely disconnected from the real market values of the assets and, therefore, from their characteristics and quality.
The project aims to define the most appropriate methodology for the revision of land register values of the entire national heritage, which satisfy the requirements of scientific rigour and which are also applicable. 
It considers the timing of the estimate of the values as a specific step in a broader methodology, which includes the node of technological infrastructures and databases.

The present paper examines such influences in a microscopic scale. In this study the role of socio-economic factors is also studies and compared to that of urban form. Two case-study neighborhoods in west of Tehran are selected and considered, first of which is a centralized and compact neighborhood and the other is a sprawled and centerless one. A Multinomial Logit Regression model is developed to consider the effects of socio-economic and land use factors on urban travel pattern. In addition, to consider the effective factors, cross-sectional comparison between the influences of local accessibility and attractiveness of the neighborhood centers of the two case-study areas are undertaken. Also the causality relationships are considered according to the findings of the survey. The findings indicate significant effects of age and household income as socio-economic factors on transportation mode choice in neighborhoods with central structure. One the other hand, no meaningful association between socio-economic or land use variables are resulted by the model for the sprawled case. The most effective land use concept in micro-scale is considered to be satisfaction of entertainment facilities of the neighborhood. Also the descriptive findings show that the centralized neighborhood that gives more local accessibility to shops and retail generates less shopping trips. In considering the causal relations, the study shows that providing neighborhood infrastructures that increase or ease the accessibility to neighborhood amenities can lead to higher shares of sustainable transportation modes like walking, biking, or public transportation use.<br />";"Houshmand Ebrahimpour Masoumi";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2013-06-30";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"IRN";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/1484";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"15"

Normally, in studying landslide we investigate different influencing factors such as gender land, atmospheric rainfall, gradients’ change, earthquake, volcanic eruption, subterranean water vibration, and human causes in the form of different models. These facts are blamed as the main share in appearing this phenomenon. However, correlative and sufficient condition for genesis such a phenomenon is historical base of lands’ bed, which needs specific formative process. There are several studies focused on distribution and dispersion of slides and their reasons. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of landslide and its effects on instigating instabilities. The preliminary results indicate that distribution of this phenomenon is associated with climate from a side and historical formative process on the other side. The weather condition of Iran is divided into four groups of cold, hot, humid and humid hot hole. Every region has its own special geomorphic properties and either directly or indirectly affects on landslide occurrence. In order to study this effect, we use Arc GIS 9.3 software dispersal map of Iran’s main landslides and formative systems on the other side and by local analyzing these two collections are evaluated based on their vicinity relationship using local-statistical techniques. Results of this research shows that the main part of this landslide occurs in cold hole and humid hole and only about 8 percent are happens in hot holl. In addition, density of landslides are more in thermodynamic bound of cold and hot hole as well as cold and humid hole.";"Mojgan Entezari Najafabadi

Treelines will not advance in a closed front parallel to the shift of any isotherm to higher elevations and more northern latitudes. The effects of varying topography on site conditions and the after-effects of historical disturbances by natural and anthropogenic factors may override the effects of slightly higher average temperatures. Moreover, the varying treeline-forming species respond in different ways to a changing climate. Forest advance upwards and northwards primarily depends on successful regeneration and survival of young growth rather than on increasing growth rates of mature trees. Every assessment of treeline response to future climate change must consider the effects of local site conditions and feedbacks of in-creasing tree population in modulating the climatically-driven change. Treeline-shift will influence regional and local climates, pedogenesis, plant communities, animal populations and biodiversity as well as having a considerable effect on economic changes in primary production. A better understanding of the functional relationships between the many treeline-relevant factors and treeline dynamics can be achieved only by extensive research at different scales within different climatic regions supported by as many as possible experimental studies in the field together with laboratory and remote sensing techniques.

Among the several reasons of the slowness in which the current program of urban regeneration proceed (NaplEst) is the generic identification of the demand for new functions in an area which plays a strategic role in the metropolitan context. The article, starting from an analysis of the land values in the space of the metropolitan city, wants to highlight their evolution. With specific reference to the peripheral areas, it is possible to catch new values, more significant with regard to the past, further confirmed by some investment choices aligned with the territorial dynamics. In this new and discontinued framework of land values, the logistic function for the regeneration of the retro-port areas seems a more realistic proposal, in accordance with the “State Plan of a first Intervention for the South industrial ports”.

Innovative Economy includes six main components: education; science; human capital, including high quality of life and highly qualified specialists; innovation systemthat includes legislative framework and material components of the innovation system (technology transfer centers, business incubators, technology parks, technopolises, innovation centers, clusters, territory of development of high technology venture business etc.); innovative industry that implements innovations; favorable environment of functioning of scientific and educational system, work and life of innovators.

The number of major components of an effective innovation economy in land management can be reduced to four: high-quality scientific and educational system in the broad definition; effective innovation system; an effective system of activity in sphere of land management, is able to produce innovative products; favorable environment for research and educational system.

In the field of scientific innovation activities model of innovative land management should offer, first of all, capitalization of new knowledge and land use. Branch to a lesser extent should focus on inclusion directly in structure of implementing pilot projects of land management  and more – to stimulate interaction with the application and the market launch of scientific and technological developments, generate in this direction new approaches, that play a role  of of communication center in the chain «Science – real market of high technologies use and protection of land and other natural resources».";"Tretyak A.M.

Questa pratica intende sopperire alla carenza di informazioni sul mercato immobiliare e alla conseguente assenza di raccolte sistematiche di dati di mercato.
Questa tradizione si ritrova nelle stime catastali svolte per gli immobili rurali (1886) e per gli immobili urbani (1939). Il reddito catastale è stimato per un immobile rappresentativo ed esteso a tutti gli altri immobili con punteggi arbitrari (numeri puri). Il valore degli immobili è derivato dal reddito catastale con moltiplicatori fissi. 
La proposta di riforma delle stime catastali (2013) prevede l’impiego di funzioni statistiche predeterminate piuttosto che gli automated valuation model applicati nel mass appraisal.
Vi sono dunque ampi spazi per razionalizzare le valutazioni. Per le valutazioni di mercato il processo di razionalizzazione si basa sul confronto tra l’expertise immobiliare e i metodi basati sulla rilevazione dei dati e sulla comparazione.

"DOAJ:bf984422a2a845ee9820bdd706193d24";"THE DIVISION OF LAND ON THE MAIN INTENDED PURPOSE AS A FUNCTION OF LAND USE MANAGEMENT IN UKRAINE";"";"Attribution of lands to categories in Ukraine is considered as one of the areas of the state, as a result of which a category of land, which defines the legal regime of use. Compliance with such a regime is one of the main responsibilities of land users, and its failure may be grounds for bringing such persons to legal liability and termination of their land rights.

Like the other functions of government, referring to the land categories are specific areas of public administration in the field of land use and protection, so there is every reason to consider the distribution and redistribution of land on the main intended purpose as a special management function in this area.

But overregulation land redistribution for the intended purpose promoted in Ukraine of corruption in this area, and large transaction costs in the activities of individuals and legal entities. This realization led to research in this area.

The main purpose of the research paper is to justify the need to improve approaches to classification of land on the main intended purpose, taking into account land use classification system ECE. 

 The basis of the classification system in Ukraine rests NACE classification system. Grading system for a long time successfully used the materials for statistical reporting, cadastre and other purposes, but has a number of shortcomings and needs further improvement, especially in the transition to automated technology cadastre. In developing the classifiers used is the hierarchical model, but the formation of values classifier was carried out not by the scheme when set all the possible values of the generalized classifier and then removed the so-called ""false values"", and by incorporating a classifier most common and known values, because these classifiers usually do not meet the criteria of completeness.

Earth Ukraine are divided on: 1) the main purpose - the category of land; 2) types of purpose - species and subspecies of land in the marginal category; 3) the nature of use - lands and functional use; 4) Ownership.

The article substantiates that the development of national land use classifications should take into account the recommendations of the European Economic Commission (EEC) at the United Nations that are listed in the ""standard statistical classification of land use ECE"". In particular, the selection criteria of the requirements to provide the necessary information mechanism and taxation of land rights registration and use of a hierarchical model that is based on a mixed-use criteria for the types of land cover and activities.

"DOAJ:baa1e1721aa64268b8101d7c671253f0";"Equity of cadastral valuation and simplified methods";"";"Real estate taxation has been intensely debated lately. The main issue concerns the formation of taxable values based on the current cadastral incomes. More specifically, the point is made against the iniquity that the current surveyed values generate in the fiscal system, thus the necessity of overcoming it.
It is known that the iniquity depends on the failed revision of valuation fees (related to the two-year period 1988-1989) and on the classification (sometimes still related to the urban cadastral) as well as on the modalities used to calculate the taxable basis through the multipliers (the IMU ones, particularly).
These are the expression of a conventional (and certainly distorting) rate of return procedure which have become tools for the income variation. During the last twenty years, the Government and the Parliament have found the solution to the problem of iniquity in the revision of the current cadastral incomes. Nevertheless, they never managed to start a veritable reform process. In fact, during these years, they have just managed to introduce temporary measures as for instance paragraph 335 e 336 of article 1 of Law 311 of December 30th
for the revision of the classification of some territorial backgrounds or of some real estate units, thus managing to control the most evident iniquities. Some other norms were approved in order to conduct remote surveys to identify properties which were never listed in the cadastre office. More than once, other possible suitable solutions have been discussed which could have been, with a fast implementation and low use of resources, a first step towards the recovery of an equity of real
estate taxation. Unfortunately, these came out to be temporary measures all the same. Last in order and worth of mention is the Ministry of Economic and Finance document by the Finance and Economy Department (hereinafter MEF) named “Ipotesi di revisione del prelievo sugli immobili” (Revision of real estate taxation proposal, August 2013) in which there is a list of all the different kind of interventions on real estate taxation, together with quantitative and qualitative valuations among which the use of the databases of the Observatory of real estate market to update the taxable basis of the Imposta municipale unica (IMU, Municipal one-tax). The solution eventually adopted by the Parliament is an overall revision capable of reforming the entire current cadastral valuation system without resorting to intermediate solutions. In fact, it has recently approved the Enabling Law 23, of 11th March, containing «Dispositions for a more equal, transparent and growth-oriented fiscal system» in which, in the article 2, a reform of the cadastral valuation system is taken into account. It is important to notice how any contrary vote has been expressed against the Enabling Law’s text while its first reading prior to the vote in the Chamber of Deputies on September 25th 2013, as well
as in the final vote which took place on February 27th 2014. Only during the first reading and vote in the Senate (February 4th 2014), 12 contrary votes were registered. These elements show how the awareness of the urgency to restore an equal real estate taxation system is largely spread and accepted. What emerges from the Parliamentary debate is that different political forces are fully aware of the necessity to restore an equal real estate taxation system as well as of the complexity of the reform and its long implementation process. The auspice is to have this system implemented as soon as possible, possibly before a five-year period. About this delicate issue, also the experts in the field and the scientific world of reference have participated in the debate about the necessity of a cadastral reform through several studies. On the one hand, they want to provide empirical proof of the taxation iniquity caused by the current system; on the other hand, they want to propose possible solutions to correct this situation.
Among these studies, there is the recent paper by Rocco Curto, Elena Fregonara, Patrizia Semeraro (2014) “Come rendere più eque le rendite catastali in attesa della revisione degli estimi?”( How can land registry values be made fairer pending a review of valuations?) in which a rapid and simple methodology to vary the current real estate rent through corrective coefficients of location is proposed. In this way, the taxable basis on real estate fees is re-defined in order to reduce the current fiscal iniquity caused by the obsolescence of the incomes based on the current cadastre office. However, a temporary correction to implement while waiting for the reform of the entire cadastral system. In particular, in their paper, Curto et al. (2014) propose to multiply the value of the current income by a coefficient obtained as a ratio between the average prices of a given census microzone and a reference index that “the ratio between an index price which most accurately sums up property values in individual municipalities or aggregations of municipalities in the case of the smallest municipalities (determined on the basis of market observations constituting the entire statistical sample) and the corresponding price indices of the values of each Microzone, defined on the basis of market observations (sub-samples)” (p. 62).
In the remainder of the paper, the methodology underlying the hypothesis contained in the MEF’s “Revision of real estate taxation proposal”(August 2013) is explained. Secondly, the methodological differences of corrections of real estate incomes proposed in the cited document by the MEF and in Curto et al. (2014)’s article are then compared. Subsequently, some empirical proof is supplied relating to the two taxable-basis equity recovery methods. Lastly, further consideration on the effective and
generalized implementation of the proposed methods will be made.";"Gianni Guerrieri

This practice makes up for the lack of information on the real
estate market and to the consequent absence of systematic collections of market data. This tradition is in the cadastral appraisal for the rural (1886) and urban properties (1939). The assessed income is appraised for a representative property and wide to all the other properties with arbitrary scores (pure number). The assessed value is derived from the income with fixed multipliers.
The reform of the cadastral appraisals (2013) provides the employment of predetermined statistic functions rather than the automated valuation models applied in the mass appraisal.
There are therefore ample spaces to rationalize the Italian valuations. For the market appraisal the process of rationalization is based on the comparison between the expertise and the market comparison approach.

Abbiamo esaminato in che misura e quanto velocemente i prezzi degli immobili residenziali abbiano reagito ad un cambiamento nei fondamentali. La conoscenza delle principali dinamiche
e cause nella formazione dei prezzi rappresenta infatti un buon punto di partenza per ogni valutazione e/o attribuzione di diritti edificatori e di politica di gestione del territorio. L’integrazione delle informazioni presenti nelle banche dati pubbliche rappresenta infatti un evidente obiettivo che non può non tenere conto del sostanziale sottoutilizzo dell’informazione disponibile.
Nel presente lavoro si è applicato ad un campione di valori immobiliari di livello regionale e riferito al periodo compreso tra il 2004 e il 2009, un modello Vector Autoregressive (VAR), al fine di consentire l’analisi delle determinanti sottese alla costituzione dei valori immobiliari. Tale tecnica ha consentito inoltre di stimare,
attraverso l’introduzione di appropriate variabili dummy, anche l’effetto di una particolare normativa finalizzata a incrementare la trasparenza del mercato stesso. Lo studio, innovativo sul panorama italiano, ha evidenziato un potente impatto dei valori delle aree edificabili e nel breve periodo anche dell’offerta di
nuove costruzioni mentre non è risultato significativo l’effetto del tasso di interesse sui valori di mercato residenziali. Un punto di particolare interesse è rappresentato dall’analizzare come i prezzi delle abitazioni abbiano reagito alla normativa fiscale adottata nel 2006. Si è riscontrato che i principali fattori esplicativi sono il reddito disponibile, l’offerta di nuove abitazioni, il numero di unità vendute, il tasso di disoccupazione e, in accordo con la letteratura, i prezzi delle aree. Quest’ultimo fattore è risultato essere uno dei più significativi specie dopo l’adozione della nuova disciplina fiscale del 2006.";"Nicola Lazzari

The MiraMap project in Turin";"";"The paper intends to illustrate an innovative approach to urban planning and shared Administration based on the use of collaborative digital platforms involving the Public Administration /
citizen.
This perspective is expressed in the MiraMap pilot project in Turin, in the District of Mirafiori Sud, which has been drawn up by a research group of the Politecnico di Torino. The project implements and develops a previous experience carried out in 2013 (Crowdmapping Mirafiori Sud), the main purpose of which was to determine whether the use of ICT could generate and support processes of social inclusion.
Through the reading of the MiraMap process, of its objectives, of the methodology adopted, of its phases and lines of action, are highlighted the interdisciplinary and technical reasoning relative to: the structuring of relations with the institutions, in particular with the Public Administration, in the processes of planning and management of public space; the triggering of the processes of inclusion, participation and civic engagement; the identification of contributions that these trials can generate in the construction of a
renewed urban governance. Lastly, this contribution outlines a possible methodology for monitoring and evaluation of ex-post impact, based on Community Impact Assessment/Evaluation (CIA/CIE), that evaluates in a descriptive manner the impacts - monetary and non-monetary - that have derived from the project in
relation to the various actors involved.
The use of ICT can foster the process of transparency and strengthen the accountability of the Public Administration, provided that the technology is an enabling factor and one of exclusion. The detailed analysis of the case provides ideas for reflection on this innovative approach: the citizen/PA relationship
can contribute in the medium-long term to conveying positive socio-economic impacts on the territory, making the citizen more informed and involved and the Administration more responsible, conscious of the needs “from below” and able to facilitate and activate inclusive processes and micro-projects throughout the territory.";"Cristina Coscia

Uma alternativa amplamente empregada para a análise da imagem de produto em geral é o mapa perceptual, instrumento composto por um diagrama que representa a imagem de vários elementos de uma mesma categoria em relação a diferentes atributos. Esse método começa a ser aplicado à análise da imagem do destino turístico, facilitando a análise das qualidades de cada lugar e do posicionamento da imagem do destino em relação a seus concorrentes. Logo, os mapas perceptuais facilitam a interpretação dos resultados do processo de mensuração da imagem do destino, contribuindo substancialmente para a gestão e o marketing de destinos turísticos. O presente artigo utiliza mapas perceptuais para analisar a imagem de alguns dos mais importantes destinos turísticos brasileiros na visão do consumidor paulistano com relação aos atrativos naturais e culturais, oferta de entretenimento, serviços turísticos, segurança e hospitalidade. O objetivo principal é ilustrar a aplicação dessa técnica de análise, discutindo-se suas contribuições e restrições e colaborando-se para o desenvolvimento metodológico da pesquisa nessa área.

Per questo motivo diversi enti pubblici in tutto il mondo stanno promuovendo nuove strategie adottando approcci innovativi come il Building Information Modelling (BIM). Paesi come Regno Unito, Germania, Francia e Spagna stanno lavorando in questa direzione investendo nella digitalizzazione del settore. Anche in Italia, sebbene l’implementazione, sempre più diffusa, delle tecnologie information-based non sia accompagnata da una strategia governativa, sono stati pubblicati bandi pubblici che richiedono l’uso del BIM. Inoltre, al fine di trarre maggiori vantaggi da un approccio BIM-based, si stanno diffondendo processi collaborativi che prevedono un coinvolgimento dei diversi attori fin dalle prime fasi del progetto. In questo modo è possibile anticipare la risoluzione di eventuali criticità prima di entrare in cantiere, individuando nello stesso tempo soluzioni ottimali per l’intero ciclo di vita di un fabbricato. All’interno della metodologia BIM, un ruolo chiave è rivestito dal Model Checking grazie al quale è possibile verificare e validare i progetti non solo in fase progettuale, ma anche durante tutte le fasi del processo. Per garantire risultati affidabili, il controllo deve partire da un’iniziale pre-check, definito BIM Validation, che validi il contenuto informativo dell’Information Model per poi procedere ad ulteriori analisi quali Clash Detection e Code Checking. L’Information Model deve essere il risultato di un’accurata fase di modellazione per poterne validare il contenuto geometrico e alfanumerico garantendo risultati affidabili per procedere, poi, con successive analisi BIM-based.";"Angelo Luigi Camillo Ciribini

Their substantial involvement and integration in most areas of operation, positioning as a factor of productive forces and significant for the sustenance of the population provide an opportunity to consider these unique resources and key to the country.

The current situation in Ukraine revealed that land resources are gradually drawn into the economic turnover. In such circumstances, the land resources acquired traits and abilities to generate market value. They have gradually become involved in the activities of the individual sectors of the economy and contribute significantly to the development of business processes. Thus, the extensive use of monetary signs associated with new, innovative approaches.

As experience shows, the most common today is the conversion mechanism of land resources in the capital believe the activities of the trust funds and securitization, which should be based on reliable data for the integrated assessment of land resources. In General, the methods of these procedures are evolving, so it is advisable to use foreign experience. At the same time, it should be noted that to achieve an acceptable level of capitalization is possible thanks to the use of other regulatory instruments. In our view, it is appropriate to include certain additional funds (if we consider capitalization as a broader process).

An important issue is the structure of formation of cost. So, the cost depends on the category of established and emerging processes that must be taken into account in the process of research the cost of signs of land resources.

From a methodological point of view, the settled (ordinary) monetary signs land resources belongs to the normative score as basis for the definition of determining the value of land. Although this rating does not reflect the real market value of the land, even in regions with high rates. Many unique properties of Ukrainian land are simply ignored.

The analysis of evaluation indicators nominal payments for the land in the Consolidated budget for the period 1999-2015. points to existing growing trend (with the exception of individual points the change of trend). In General, the existence of such processes shows positive trends, however, given the existing capacity, payments for the use of land resources could be much greater. The question is as to the formation of such payments and low current rates that are charged to users of land resources.

It is not worth that a significant portion of the profits, which is formed in the APK, is generated by the export of grain. So there is the potential of raising fees for use of the resource.

One of the tools for solving this problem can be considered in view of the potential signs of value are activated under the influence of new processes, namely: capitalization, corporatization, securitization, and the like.

Land holds a special place in the structure of natural resource potential of the state. Identifying high cost performance, they are attractive for Ukrainian and foreign investors. In addition to ordinary usage, cost characteristics (especially those that are based on new processes) form favorable conditions for active use of the resource as environment to attract capital.";"Stetsyuk Myhajlo

mountain areas of Europe and North America, large numbers of red deer have become a threat to the maintenance
of high-elevation forests and attempts to restore the climatic treeline. In northern Fennoscandia, overgrazing by
reindeer in combination with mass outbreaks of the autumnal moth are influencing treeline dynamics. Moose are
also increasingly involved damaging treeline forest. In the Alps, the re-introduction of ibex is causing local damage
to subalpine forests and tree establishment above the forest limit as well as aggravating soil erosion. High-elevation
forests and treeline in Europe are susceptible to the deleterious impact of wild ungulate populations because of
former extensive pastoral use. Rodents may damage tree seedlings and saplings by girdling, root cutting, bark
stripping and burrowing. Hares damage young trees by gnawing. Large numbers of small rodents may occasionally
impede tree regeneration by depleting the seed sources. Rodents do not contribute to forest expansion beyond the
current treeline. Among birds, nutcrackers are highly effective in influencing tree distribution patterns and treeline
dynamics. Without the nutcracker caching of stone pine seeds any upward advance of the trees in response to
climatic warming would be impossible. Some bird species such as black grouse, willow grouse and ptarmigan can

With the collapse of the Lomé Convention in 1996, St. Lucia saw its banana export market suffer a steep decline.  Since then, Lomé St. Lucia has focused on market-led international tourism as the new engine of growth.  Market-led development is fraught with economic cycles of up and down that lead to economic uncertainty and catastrophe for many people of limited resources.  Much government revenue is spent on tourist-oriented infrastructure at the expense of a well-funded social security system.  A new, morally oriented economic philosophy is called for at this time.  The focus should be on a basic-needs approach and the welfare of the population rather than the needs of the market for continual growth and profit.  In this regard, the paper examines the role of family land tenure in providing a common good to help alleviate the hardships of economic downturn. For thousands of co-owning heirs that may need refuge from the vagaries of the international market, family land can provide temporary economic or subsistence shelter.  With an economy of limited opportunity, government policy informed by a sense of moral obligation should encourage family land as a form of social security for those numerous co-owners working in off-farm enterprises such as tourism, in which economic uncertainty is ever present.";"Jack Thornburg";"";"Lindenwood University";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2011-04-30";"en";"local community;rural population;urban population";"Urban Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://www.lindenwood.edu/jigs/docs/volume2Issue2/essays/1-20.pdf";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"";"";"19"

A realização da pesquisa contou com os seguintes procedimentos metodológicos: levantamento de dados em órgãos e instituições governamentais (IBGE, SETUR/RN, Prefeitura Municipal); levantamento, georreferenciamento e mapeamento dos estabelecimentos comerciais e de serviços; registros fotográficos; e realização de entrevistas com 98 empresários dos segmentos comercial e de serviço. Os resultados indicaram que houve crescimento dos comércios e serviços à medida que houve a expansão do lazer no litoral analisado, e que sua dinâmica de funcionamento e dos fluxos que convergem para esta área são regidos pela sazonalidade. O estudo concluiu que apesar de ter ocorrido o crescimento dos comércios e serviços decorrente da expansão do lazer, a economia local é bastante fragilizada devido a sazonalidade e a centralidade de Natal, que embora impulsione os fluxos dos municípios analisados, também inibe o crescimento de comércios e serviços na área.

Transformation of land relations violated the the traditional forms of organization of agricultural production, reduced the efficiency of  capital investmenst in improvement of using and protection of land.

Therefore, to improve the efficiency of agricultural land use in conditions of formation of market economy, general urgent of time is an in-depth analysis of the types and forms of land use which have found their consolidation at the legislative level.

Land management is carried out throughout the country. It enveloped lands irrespective of unequivocal purpose, ownership and the character of using. But goals and objectives of land management, it’s content may be different. An important feature of land management are and it’s types. The current Land Code of Ukraineas the the Law of Ukraine ""On Land Management"" don’t contain legislative provisions on division of land management for certain types. Meanwhile, it should be noted, that normative and legal acts on land management of the Soviet period (Fundamentals of land legislation of the USSR and the United Republics 1968). Land codes 1978., 1990, 1992 there are two separate types of it - intereconomic (Modern terminology of A.M. Tretyak - territorial) and internaleconomic. Modern practice of the actions in the field of land management as evidenced by about the existence of another and a third type of land management – separational. Each of them is characterized by a specific purpose, carried out at different levels.

Given that the process of implementation of land management for the object of land relations and cadastral accounting taken land plot, made sharing of agricultural land, where the owners of land shares allocated of land ownership, land use system, especially agricultural enterprises, significantly changed. All this has caused the emergence of a new type of territorial land management, which is aimed, especially in agriculture and environmental protection, on the organization of land use of legal entities and citizens, on the basis of combining of land plots, that being at different property rights. Therefore, should provide as a type of land management territorial planning of land ownership, land use, whose task is the formation of their territory, as is the case in developed foreign countries.

Concerning intraeconomic land management, that under current conditions it’s explanation is somewhat different in new approaches to the regulation of land relations and the introduction of land use administration.

In terms of European integration, which is the basis of foreign policy identity Ukraine, acquires particular significance modernization of the state, forming an effective and efficient system of public administration (Public Administration), able to introduce systematic and consistent decisions, submission of all tasks of foreign and domestic policy achievement of the conditions and criteria membership in the European Union, particularly in the field of biodiversity conservation and land use management of protected areas, as its component.

The signing of the Association Agreement between Ukraine, on one hand, and the European Union and its Member States, of the other part (the Agreement) offers new opportunities and creates new standards in various areas of public life, including environmental protection. Sectoral cooperation in the field of environmental protection in the Agreement stipulated in Chapter 6, which is called ""Environment"" Chapter V «economic and sectoral cooperation."" For Ukraine, the implementation of EU legislation in the field of the environment occurs within the eight sectors governed by 29 sources of law (Directives and Regulations) of the EU in this area. Directive and Regulation establishes common rules and standards that need to be transposed (transferred) to domestic law. These rules and standards are not the subject of discussion and be completely achieved, otherwise stipulated penalties. Unlike modern environmental legislation of Ukraine, which in many respects is a declarative sources of EU law determine the quantitative and qualitative results, which should reach every country within a specified period of time. The feature of EU Directives is that States must adapt their legislation to achieve the goals set Directives, but decide for themselves how they achieve it.

The main causes of biodiversity loss necessitated justification of various economic tools for conservation, both market and non-market, fiscal, legal, management, etc., depending on the natural features and economic systems and customs of a country. These measures provide a set of tools to overcome the negative features of the market, policy and institutional failures and to encourage people to preserve biodiversity in the course of business. Economic instruments can be used to improve the efficient allocation and use of natural and environmental resources so as to better reflect the social costs of using these resources. Eliminating the shortcomings of the national economic and environmental models of biodiversity management and environmental land use, finding ways of upgrading will become an effective instrument for the adaptation of the European model of sustainable use and conservation of all components of biological diversity.

In these circumstances, especially important is the creation of reliable theoretical and methodological principles of adaptation experience of the European system of protected areas, implementing the use of ecological and economic tools and mechanisms to encourage local authorities and communities in which the impact of conditionality EU will promote reform of state environmental control in Ukraine according to European standards.";"L.

Despite the EIPs configurations being essentially based on the overall idea of sustainability, the problem of defining their proper location inside the territory and the consequent land use model, to minimize land consumption, have not always been central in the wide range of studies and practices concerning the EIPs. Nevertheless, the specific problem of a drastic reduction of land consumption at the EIP planning stage acquires a crucial role and, therefore, needs to be carefully assessed inside the perspective of sustainable urban development. In this framework, the paper firstly aims at facing the nontrivial relationship between the EIPs’ theorizations and implementations and the reduction of land consumption by referencing specific studies and shared tools, where new developments have been favored despite the conversion and redevelopment of existing industrial parks; secondly, it focus on an Italian case study and its emblematic EIP planning processes, in order to deepen the contradictions between sustainable spatial planning and eco-industrial parks. Finally, some final conclusions will be presented, in order to integrate some main issues concerning the reduction of land consumption inside the more traditional EIP design processes.";"Elisa Conticelli and Simona Tondelli";"";"Molecular Diversity Preservation International";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-08-31";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/admsci4030331";"http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3387/4/3/331";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/admsci/about under Copyright/Open Access Section";"18"

An Assessment by Pandora 3.0 Model for Land Use Decision Making";"";"Landscape connectivity is one of the major issues related to biodiversity conservation and to the delivery of Ecosystem Services (ES). Several models were developed to assess landscape connectivity but lack of data and mismatching scale of analysis often represent insurmountable constraints for the correct evaluation and integration of ecological connectivity into plans and assessment procedures. In this paper a procedure for ES assessment related with Habitat and Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) is proposed. The method is based on the connectivity measure furnished by the last version of PANDORA model and uses a modified formulation of current ES evaluation. The implementation of the model in a real case has highlighted its potential multi-scale workability. The spatial approach of the model aims at furnishing a further tool for the spread of ES and landscape ecology concepts into procedures of assessment (e.g. EIA, SEA) and land use planning at different administrative scales.";"Raffaele Pelorosso

"DOAJ:85f22477bf33485bb39472ad0f75bedd";"BEFORE THE SALE RIGHTS TO AGRICULTURAL LAND";"";"One of the most important problems of the Ukrainian economy is the formation of a civilized land market. We have to admit that the process of formation of private ownership of land in Ukraine entered into a protracted and uncertain nature. Another introduction in Ukraine of the moratorium on sale of agricultural land due to the lack of resolution of many land issues and not sformovat market infrastructure. Because for the majority of producers of agricultural products the sale of lease rights is an innovation. On the sale of lease rights still they are almost not heard, and especially not used in practice, although the possibility of disposal of property rights, which is owned and leasehold, provided by norms of the Civil code of Ukraine.

The issue of land bidding (auction) is relevant, because the law of Ukraine set the priority of this method of trading in the sale or lease of land.

The auction is open and transparent way the exclusion of land resources of the territorial community, that is, eliminates the influence of corruption and receipt of funds in local budgets adds the ability to invest in the economy of human settlements and agriculture. Among the economic benefits to the development industry is not only improving the investment climate, replenishment of budgets of all levels and approaching the level of EU countries in matters of land. Holding of auctions is very attractive from the point of view of filling the local budget, the sale of land has its advantages, namely a quick and significant revenue.

The lease right may be alienated in accordance with the current legislation of Ukraine and some legislative solution is not needed.

The procedure of land auctions includes the following steps:

1. The organizer of land sales (public authority or local authority) determines the list of land plots of state or municipal property and rights thereto, which are exposed at the land auction as separate lots.

2. The decision of a public authority or local authority on the land auction.

3. Drawing of lots for the land auction includes: creation, coordination and approval of the project land for allotment of land (in case of changing the target purpose of the land plot and in case the boundaries of the land are not established in kind (on ground); state registration of the land plot; state registration of property rights to land; the receipt of the statement of regulatory monetary evaluation of land plot in case of sale of land auction the right to lease it; an expert monetary valuation of land, except in cases of sales of land auction the right to lease it; the establishment of the starting price sale of land, which on the lands of state and communal ownership cannot be lower than expert monetary valuation of land; the establishment of a starting annual rent of the lands of state and communal ownership may not be less than the amount of rent;

4. A contract between the organizer of land sales and land auction administrator (business entity, which is licensed to conduct land auctions) for the tendering.

5. Publication in print media and on the official website announcement indicating the date of tendering and list of lots. The absence of a land market is a rejection of the economic methods of land redistribution and, as a consequence, the introduction of administrative, which is a deviation from the formation of a market economic system. In all countries with a market economy with a high level of industrial development of agriculture and agribusiness was primarily achieved through the active participation of the state in providing legal and financial stability. This eliminates the preconditions of naturalization of agricultural production, and also introduced the principle of - land to those who it works better.";"KUSTOVSKA О.

This paper uses both Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and statistical tools to empirically test this hypothesis. With local land use and trip making data as inputs, it first calculates two common indices of land-use mixture - entropy and dissimilarity indices, using GIS tool, supplemented by Microsoft Excel. Afterwards, it uses Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to calculate the correlation matrices among land-use mixture indices, socioeconomic variables, and home-based work/other trip rates, followed by a series of regression model runs on these variables. Through this study, it has been found that land-use mixture has some but weak effects on home-based work trip rate, and virtually no effects on home-based other trip rate. In contrast, socioeconomic variables, especially auto ownership, have larger effects on home-based trip making.  ";"Yin - Shan MA

However, in spite of considerable international press, there is still little evidence to substantiate this claim. This study proposes a method through which the cost-effectiveness of EbA strategies can be evaluated against alternative adaptation options, and contributes to South African literature on the subject. The potential cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration is assessed as a means of securing the carrying capacity of land for pastoralist communities of the Kamiesberg communal area in South Africa under projected future climate conditions. The conventional alternatives would be to respond to increasingly dry conditions by drilling boreholes and using supplemental feed for livestock. It was assumed that the EbA interventions would occur upfront, whereas the alternatives are more likely to be implemented in reaction to droughts over a longer time period. The study found the implementation of conventional alternatives to be more cost-effective than EbA as a means to sustaining livestock stocking rates, with EbA being twice as costly. However, this is framed from the perspective of those directly affected (the landowners), and does not include the benefits to broader society.";"David Black

Il tema è importante poiché lo studio dell’andamento del valore dei suoli nello spazio e nel tempo permette di valutare la formazione della rendita urbana, indispensabile per realizzare una pianificazione equa ed efficace.
Le analisi confermano ipotesi già formulate in passato e ben note agli operatori del mercato immobiliare.
La prima evidenza emersa è che l’andamento del valore delle aree edificabili è concorde con quello del valore immobiliare e che l’incremento osservato negli ultimi anni in termini relativi è significativamente superiore a quello avvenuto in passato. Ciò sembra confermare che, durante le fasi di espansione del mercato
immobiliare, buona parte dell’incremento di valore dei fabbricati è catturato dalla rendita dei suoli. La seconda considerazione riguarda la dinamica del valore nel tempo: è stato rilevato che nei periodi di espansione della domanda, l’incremento di valore delle aree centrali è nettamente superiore a quello delle aree periferiche; ciò significa che la rendita assoluta generata dalla scarsità nei centri urbani è superiore alla rendita differenziale creata con l’espansione urbana nelle aree periferiche. Infine, è stato evidenziato che il ruolo dei fattori che influiscono sul valore delle aree edificabili sembra differenziarsi in funzione della

The focus dwells on the praxis and urban planning perspectives as a link and means for realizing the public interest in space and the role of 'urban transplants' as a lever of urban development. It has also been pointed to a certain discrimination of the property status and property rights through the category of 'public interest', which is articulated by way of urban planning. The unfairness of the existing planning system towards private property and 'taxation' of entrepreneurial activities is evident, especially in urban land use i.e. installing the height of the land rent. It is expected that urban planning is competent upon the background of societal democratization, privatization and introduction of market institutions where the perspectives shift towards democratic transformation, the regulatory role and protection of property rights and different actors’ interests in using urban land.

It demonstrates the social construction process at work in the evolution of real estate market risks. The objective is to highlight the conditions that allow or impede the implementation of ‘opportunistic’ and ‘conservative’ risk strategies. By analyzing the market entry of financial investors in the Cuautitlan industrial real estate market - an ‘emerging’ real estate market in Mexico City - this paper demonstrates that, due to the joint action of land developers, non-financial as well as financial real estate investors, this market moved from being ‘too risky’ to becoming an opportunistic market, and then a conservative one. There were two important phases in the transformation process. First, the contribution of land developers was fundamental to the transformation of the market from being too risky to being opportunistic from the perspective of financial investors. Two different types of land developers are evident: some are not willing to help financial investors’ entry in the market while others developed a business plan designed to facilitate financial investments. In the second phase of the market’s risks transformation, opportunistic financial investors enabled the conditions for the arrival of conservative financial investors, thanks to their presence in emerging markets and the diffusion of information.";"Louise David";"";"Articulo – Journal of Urban Research";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2012-11-30";"en;fr";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"MEX";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/articulo.2163";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"https://articulo.revues.org/2860";""

Information about the quantity and quality of lands summarizing by the central executive authority that implements the state policy in the sphere of land relations. Summarized information on the quantity and quality of land on gratis personnel provided to state authorities and local governments according to Order of conducting of State Land Cadastre.

One of the main problems of accounting quality of lands is in Ukraine now is not only the absence of regulatory documents, but also the reliability of available information According to it’s providing is necessary of availability of actual information about the status of land resources.

The absence of qualitative characteristics land plots in cadastral system complicates state control over land use and protection, because there are no grounds for levy fines for the catastrophic decline of soil fertility.

If with soil units identified, so the indicators that characterize them more difficult. That indicators, which were the basis for accounting of the quality of lands should check up to modern realities and condition of soils.

According to the Law of Ukraine ""On Land Protection"", in the field of land protection and restoration of soil fertility establishes the following standards:  maximum allowable soil contamination; qualitative condition of soils; the optimum ratio of lands; indicators of land and soils degradation.

Standards of qualitative conditions of soils establishing in order to prevent their depletion and are used for monitoring the qualitative quality of conditions of soils.

Standarts of quantative condition of soils are determining the level of pollution, optimal nutrient content, physical and chemical properties, etc..

The main problem of State Land Cadastre of Ukraine is the almost complete lack of information from the accounting of land quality. Filling the layer of ""soil"" in the Public Cadastral Map, according to the approved nomenclature list agro-industrial groups of soils, most likely does not correspond to the current state. It is connected with outdated information about the soils, because it was based on data from large-scale of soil surveys, which for several decades have not conducted.

Conducted analysis shows that land reform in Ukraine leads to a change of ownership of land, contributes to solving problems of citizens by land plots, enactment of payment for land usecreation of conditions for the development of land market. Thus changing land relations, is formed legal and regulatory framework of land reform and land market.

However, positive developments in the implementation of land reform to end of the 90-th years have not led to a radical and effective upgrade of agricultural production, recovery of investment processes in other branches of industry, improving of welfare of the population. Land reform measures didn’t receive adequate financial support. The ultimate goal - an economically-effective and environmentally safe use of land in Ukraine - has not been achieved.

Further reforming of land relations contributed to the adoption in October 2001 of the Land Code of Ukraine in the new edition that created the legal principles of land reform. Since it’s adoption appeared legal framework that allows you to create land market. The Land Code of Ukraine solved question of compliance of Constitution of Ukraine, harmony between rules of the Land Code with rules of land laws and decrees of President of Ukraine. It contains rules of directly of direct action, in contrast to the general declarations.

The next step in the development of land relations on the period of 2011 - 2020 years became Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from 26.10.2011 y. № 1072-р «On approval of the action plan for land reform and create a transparent market of agricultural land» This plan envisages simplification of procedures for establishing of  the boundaries of settlements, on amendments to some legislative acts of Ukraine concerning the abolition of free land privatization, about analyzing, systematization, organizing, organizing and bringing to a common electronic format of cadastral information; draft resolution on approval of documents regulating the administration of state land cadastre, approval of the Concept of the National Program of land use and protection, ect.

One of the final stages of the land reform in agriculture should be the implementation of land market.

The historical review of land reform, evaluation of its positive results and negative effects allow asserting, that in general it was carried overly inconsistently and not always scientifically substantiated. Its end result, due to the transition to a market economy, would be sharing and transfer of land to peasants to private ownership, establishment on this basis of market-oriented farms, implementation of fully functioning land market. The intermediate stages (the transfer of land to collective ownership, issuance of land certificates) only slowed reform, the numerous laws and regulations confused its essence and caused many irregularities in land relations.";"Barantsov B.";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-05-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"UKR";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/7213/6998";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"9"

treeline dynamics during the period 1915 to 2007 in the Swedish Scandes. The purpose is to give a concrete face of
the landscape transformation which is associated with the recorded treeline shifts. The main focus is on stand-level
structure of past and present treelines and the advance zones, where climate change elicited responses by Betula pubescens
ssp. czerepanovii, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris. All species shifted their treelines upslope by a maximum
of c. 200 m in elevation. Most sites, however, manifested changes of smaller magnitudes. This relates to topoclimatic
constraints which decouple treeline performance from the macroclimate. The general character of sites which
support large and small treeline shifts, respectively, are outlined. The spacing, age structure, growth rates of the tree
advance zones are accounted for each of the concerned species. In temporal and spatial detail, the different tree species
responded individualistically according to their specific ecologies. Current spread of young seedlings and saplings
to increasingly higher elevations in the alpine tundra is particularly highlighted as it may represent the forefront
of future treeline advance. It is argued that the current evolution of the treeline ecotone represents a fundamental,

As for the capital of Ukraine - Kyiv, it is a great cultural, historical and commercial and industrial center. So we can safely say that Kyiv is characterized by all the environmental problems that are inherent in all large cities. This, above all, traffic pollution, changes in the air quality, noise pollution, emissions of chemicals into the atmosphere, pollution, toxic waste, the problem of waste. But a special place in this region occupies a radioactive problem due to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Also, nearby, in the Kyiv region Kiev reservoir are with not the best environmental conditions. The most important components of ecosystems: the air of the city, urban and suburban water sources, soil city. International experts conducted a study in 215 cities around the world.

Using GIS, we have quantitatively and visually analyzed the correspondence between land-use distribution and Arab residential patterns and their changes in the period between 1983 and 2008 in five mixed Arab-Jewish Israeli cities. Results show a correspondence between the dynamics of Arab/Jewish residential patterns and the spatial distribution of various land-uses. Arab residential patterns diffused faster towards areas with relatively inferior land-uses than towards areas with more attractive land-uses, in which a gentrification process occurred. Moreover, large-scale non-residential land-uses act as spatial partitions that divide between Arab and Jewish residential areas. Understanding the association between the urban environment and residential patterns can help in formulating an appropriate social and spatial policy concerning planning of land-uses and design of the built environment in mixed cities.

The system of common environmental criteria optimization of land use in terms of radiation contamination is presented. The order and sequence of application of common environmental criteria of optimal land use in terms of radiation contamination are determined.             Rational use and protection of land large scientific-technical, social, economic, and environmental issue of our time, the solution of which depends achieve both economic and social goals of our society. This is primarily due to the exceptional role of land in the production of wealth, constraint, and the inability to replace land resources and anthropogenic environmental changes in large areas, causing activation of soil erosion, creating man-made landscapes, flooding, and flooding large areas of land pollution products and waste industrial production, radionuclides, chemicals. The feature of the land is also not the same quality and fertility of different plots, property continuously improved when used properly.            The Chernobyl disaster a substantial part of the territory of Ukraine dangerous radiation situation, about 20% of the long term are the basis for the manifestation of small doses of radiation is created. This necessitates the analysis of areas of land for their suitability for agricultural production.            Significant impact on agricultural production in many regions of Ukraine were consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Thus, about 20% of Ukraine have a long-term basis for the display of small doses of radiation. Research methods of organizational systems, environmental, economic, and technological measures to ensure stable functioning of agro-ecosystems based radiation factor is carried out.            In research still missing environmental and economic analysis of the relationship between the efficiency of land use and economic-economic factors, but some parts of this communication were studied in various aspects of individual experts (both soil scientists, surveyors, and economists). However, some previously developed land and security measures are based only on the results of fragmentary (in key areas) and the component (mostly soil and geo-botanical) studies. This approach to basic research in the field of sustainable land use, particularly in terms of radiation contamination, does not sound scientific foundations placement agricultural and industrial production, study land protection measures, is not conducive to the stability of the environment.            Analyzing the system of generally defined environmental criteria optimization of land use should be noted that they are essential and should be used in the analysis of land use in terms of radiation contamination. It should only determine the order and sequence of their calculation. This will create a coherent methodology for optimizing land use in terms of radiation contamination. The order of calculation of main criteria defined on the PC provides:- Calculation of radionuclide transfer from soil to plants, taking into account the density of pollution.- Determination of eligibility agro-industrial groups of soils for growing crops, depending on the density of pollution.- Determining the fate of contamination of agricultural products relative to the control level, depending on the density of pollution.- Calculation washout of soils. A definite order and sequence of generally defined environmental criteria the optimum use of land in terms of radiation contamination allows to analyze the status of land use and recommendations for further land use. Methodological foundations are based on the current economic and mathematical methods and the use of electronic computer engineering, advanced research in the field of radiology, ecology, land use and so on.

Il loro tratto caratteristico è costituito da comunità che difendono il loro territorio da aggressioni esterne che possono essere costituite tanto da manufatti invasivi, quanto da insediamenti umani sgraditi. Questo articolo si propone di rispondere a tre domande: 1) perché si sono diffusi in questi ultimi venti anni? 2) qual è il “vero” oggetto del contendere? 3) come possono essere affrontati, con quali possibili sbocchi?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non esiste una risposta univoca a queste domande. Analizzando i discorsi che circolano su questo tema, emergono sei tipi di risposte che giungono a risultati diversi. I conflitti territoriali vengono infatti visti di volta in volta (a) come manifestazioni particolaristiche che impediscono il soddisfacimento di interessi generali, (b) come l’effetto di attori interessati che strumentalizzano a proprio vantaggio le paure delle popolazioni; (c) come l’esito della sproporzione tra costi concentrati e benefici diffusi; (d) come reazione a rischi inaccettabili; (e) come resistenza dei luoghi ai flussi che li invadono; (f) come richiesta di un diverso modello di sviluppo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La conclusione è che i conflitti territoriali sono fenomeni a molte facce. Se ci concentrassimo – come spesso viene fatto nel dibattito corrente – su una sola di esse, rischieremmo di accontentarci di una visione semplificata e, per ciò stesso, distorta.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;In contemporary societies, territorial conflicts, i.e. conflicts concerning unwelcome facilities or LULU (Locally Unwanted Land Use), tend to be more frequent and widespread than social conflicts. These conflicts are characterized  by the protest of local communities that fight for the defence of  their land from external aggressions, such as invasive artefacts (motorways, high speed lines, waste disposal plants, etc.) or human settlements (Roma camps, mosques, immigrants, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article aims to answer to three questions: 1) why these conflicts have increased in last decades? 2) what is their real stake? 3) how can be dealt with and with which possible outcomes?&lt;br /&gt;There is no single answer to these questions. If we take into consideration the discourses that are made on this issue, six types of narratives emerge that go in different directions. The territorial conflicts are seen, from time to time. (a) as the expression of particularistic and egoistic points of view that prevent the fulfilment of the general interest, (b) as the pressure of vested interests that exploit to the fear of the population for other purposes; (c ) as the consequence of the imbalance between concentrated costs and distributed benefits; (d) as a reaction to risks that are deemed unacceptable;  (e) as the resistance of the places against the flows that invade or cross them; (f) as a demand for a different model of development.&lt;br /&gt;The conclusion is that such conflicts are multi-faceted phenomena. If we pay attention - as the current debate often do -  only on one of these several dimensions, we risk to content ourselves with a  simplified and, thereby, distorted interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;";"Luigi Bobbio";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2012-01-31";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/article/view/569";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"9"

Scenario-based cellular automata urban growth modeling and policy applications";"";"The formation of ‘Urban Networks’ has become a wide-spread phenomenon around the world. In the study of metropolitan regions, there are competing or diverging views about management and control of environmental and land-use factors as well as about scales and arrangements of settlements. Especially in China, these matters alongside of regulatory aspects, infrastructure applications, and resource allocations, are important because of population concentrations and the overlapping of urban areas with other land resources. On the other hand, the increasing sophistication of models operating on iterative computational power and widely-available spatial information and analytical techniques make it possible to simulate and investigate the spatial distribution of urban territories at a regional scale. This research applies a scenario-based Cellular Automata model to a case study of the Changjiang Delta Region, which produces useful and predictive scenario-based projections within the region, using quantitative methods and baseline conditions that address issues of regional urban development. The contribution of the research includes the improvement of computer simulation of urban growth, the application of urban form and other indices to evaluate complex urban conditions, and a heightened understanding of the performance of an urban network in the Changjiang Delta Region composed of big, medium, and small-sized cities and towns.";"ChengHe Guan

Priority land reform was to be the formation of land market relations that would ensure continued efficient reallocation of land resources based on market self-regulation. Implementation of large-scale land reforms in these areas has caused huge problems of acute social, economic and environmental. Properly not the rational use and protection of land resources, reproduction of the productive potential of agricultural lands.

Particularly acute problem of management and expanded reproduction of land resources as a basis for sustainable development of Ukraine. Pressing problem today is to resolve these matters in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. Particulary attention should be focused on the implementation of integrated land use by solving problems of  the rational use of land, an important aspect of which is to optimize land use.

Irrational land use system has led to serious environmental consequences, namely the presence of such manifestations of land degradation as erosion, technogenic pollution, secondary alkalinity, flooding and landslides.

The high level of tilled land, including hills, a significant expansion of crops cultivated crops and almost complete cessation of work package for soil protection, violation of the cultivation leads to land degradation.

The current state of land use Cherkasy region does not meet the requirements of environmental management. Violated environmentally acceptable ratio of arable land, natural grasslands, which adversely affects the stability of agricultural landscapes.

Optimizing the efficiency of land use requires evidence-based approach to land. So based on upgraded inventory system and effective land management by taking into account environmental and economic component of their assessment, you can achieve a significant positive impact on the economy of the region and the state as a whole.

The current system of land use must meet the following parameters: include complex of soil-reclamation measures to expanded reproduction of soil fertility, built on the optimal structure of agricultural land formations, consider advanced technologies and harmoniously coordinated in agricultural ecosystems. World experience shows that the efficiency of agriculture is possible only in conditions of heavy use soil by reducing investments in unproductive land.

Land resources are one of the most important types of resource area. In modern conditions for intensive agricultural cultivation should involve productive agricultural land, one third should remain in it’s natural state that provide ecological balance in nature and will help produce more gross yield per unit area.

The implementation of the proposed measures to optimize the structure of agricultural land Cherkasy region, namely the withdrawal areas and unproductive soils from intensive cultivation and further their conservation, will effectively use land without significant adverse effects on soils and simultaneously achieve a given economic effect. So, to start rationalizing land use should decrease the rate of tilled area to the optimum value (40%).

This paper is based on a critical literature review together with expert interviews. It comments on the methodology of spatial benefit-cost analysis (benefit for price premium ‘generated’ by the amenity; costs for price discounts ‘generated’ by the risk) in relation to design of housing and hazard management mechanisms within the context of urban land use in contemporary Trondheim, Norway. The particular issue at stake concerns potential quick clay landslide hazard areas. Prior research suggests that the role of situation by a coast, lake or river should not be overlooked when assessing possibilities for financing general water related hazard abatement schemes. This is potentially a win-win-situation: safety enhancing public works could be financed based on the added value of new developments at the given location. The purported kind of innovative financial mechanism however requires close cooperation between private developers and local authorities – in other words, governance instead of government – as well as flexible legal codes. Unfortunately the study area to a great extent lacks such institutional possibilities due to an outmoded conceptualization of the role of government intervention.</span></p>";"Tom Kauko";"";"Firenze University Press";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2013-08-31";"en;it";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NOR";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.13128/Aestimum-13170";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.fupress.net/index.php/ceset/about/editorialPolicies#openAccessPolicy";"16"

The common characteristics of these concepts are singled out based on the analysis of current legislation of Ukraine. These characteristics are following: 1) the restrictions and encumbrances are established for the use of land by its owners and users; 2) they are established in the framework provided by law or agreement; 3) they stay in force within the term established by law or contract; 4) change of legal of the land plot title does not terminate the established restrictions or encumbrances; 5) All restrictions in land use are a subject to state registration (Art. 110 Land Code of Ukraine).

Based on the views systematization of domestic scientists and own views there are obvious need to justify a separation of overall concept of ""restrictions in land use"" and ""encumbrances of land rights"" into two separate concepts, taking into account the target criteria as the primary and as well the forms and grounds of their establishment to develop scientifically grounded definitions that reflect the specific attributes of these restrictions and encumbrances.

Consequently, restrictions in land use and the encumbrances of land rights are separate economic and legal categories that do not depend on each other and limits of land rights and other natural resources.

The author's definitions of the studied concepts are suggested.

Restrictions in land use is a definition of the limits and conditions of land use and other natural resources (mode of land use) in socially significant interests (public benefit and safety, environmental, historical and cultural values, creating the necessary conditions for other state needs) in land management documentation on the basis of local authorities decisions or in court order. Restrictions in land use have territorial and individual character on a specified land plot.

Encumbrance of land rights is the restriction of land rights by the law or act of authorized authority, by official or contract in the way of imposing a ban on the use of the land, including through its alienation as servitude or obligation adopted by land user voluntarily or in court order to ensure the legitimate interests of stakeholders, which are expressed in granting them additional rights and in laying the responsibilities on land user. Encumbrances of land rights arise only individually on specifically identified land plot and are in direct connection with this land plot and follow it in case of transfer of ownership of such land plot to another person.

Using these concepts in research and law-making will differentiate the scope of their application in land and other relations.";"Tretyak A.M.

If clarification of the concept of tourism and tourism product was essential to explain to some extent the reasons for the offer (why tourism activities born and develop?), the opportunity to single out, among the various definitions that have been proposed in the literature, the characteristic features of the destination seems equally significant to get to the explanation of why management system offered (comprehensive and complex product). The basic questions are: What drives tourists to go from s place of habitual residence to a place in which the natural, environmental and cultural region are completely different from starting? What does turning a geographical place into a tourism destination? Because some tourists prefer certain destinations than the other? What is the impact of tourism in terms of territorial and urban mobility? The transport system can be considered a resource-generating competitive advantages? The framework of the article is represented by the Marshallian theory of industrial district which puts the land and its resources behind the development of the local system. It tries to overlay the framework VRIO (Value, Rarity, inimitably, Organization), derived from the Resource Based View, in determining whether a particular resource area can generate a sustainable competitive advantage and lasting. Stakeholder Theory is the framework that leads the analysis of the impact of tourism development policy on local businesses and the framework of Corporate Social Responsibility leads in environmental issues. Against this background, in this paper will be exhibited in the various contributions of the literature on tourism systems starting from the basic that tourist is a person who drives a process of spending a part of his income in a place other than in his habitual residence. The choice of the destination to enjoy the tourist facilities and carry out the complementary activities of consumption is the result of a complex decision-making process based on selection among alternative competitive solutions that are able to respond to a set of needs and aspirations to equal costs and level of services required. Then you will be taken into consideration of the manner in which a geographic location becomes a tourist destination and the way in wich the structural characteristics (accommodation services, catering, equipment) and infrastructure (accessibility geographical, social and economic) are able to express a point of ""emotional"" for tourists; the encounter between supply and demand is seen according to the post-Fordist framework of ""Mutual Value"" that drives the service process in tourism businesses and the way in which an assets (tangible and intangible) may be able to generate a competitive advantage in the market. Hereinafter the tourism phenomenon is related to the concept of territorial mobility to highlight the impact that it creates on environmental and urban planning, and the need to monitor and plan the phenomenon for structural and infrastructural adjustment of the territory in the way of sustainability. Finally will be exposed some cases of urban and extra-urban mobility in tourism according to a perspective that sees the urban and suburban transport a real resource (VRIO) generating competitive advantage for the local system.<br>Il turismo e le attivit&amp;agrave; da esso generate si combinano con il fattore territoriale dando luogo al processo di fruizione del servizio turistico caratterizzato essenzialmente dalla contestualit&amp;agrave; dell&amp;rsquo;erogazione e del consumo di un&amp;rsquo;entit&amp;agrave; in buona parte immateriale in un contesto geografico scelto dal consumatore e definito destinazione turistica. Se la chiarificazione del concetto di turismo e di prodotto turistico &amp;egrave; risultata essenziale per spiegare in un certo senso le ragioni dell&amp;rsquo;offerta (perch&amp;eacute; nascono e si sviluppano le attivit&amp;agrave; turistiche?), altrettanto significativa sembra l&amp;rsquo;opportunit&amp;agrave; di enucleare, tra le varie definizioni che sono state proposte nella letteratura specialistica, gli elementi caratteristici della destinazione turistica per arrivare alla spiegazione delle ragioni del management del sistema di offerta (prodotto complesso e globale). Le domande di fondo sono: Cosa spinge i turisti a partire dal luogo di abituale dimora per recarsi in una localit&amp;agrave; che presenta caratteristiche naturali, ambientali e culturali completamente diverse dalla regione di partenza? Cosa fa trasformare un territorio in una destinazione? Perch&amp;eacute; alcuni flussi turistici prediligono determinate destinazioni rispetto alle altre? Quale &amp;egrave; l&amp;rsquo;impatto sul piano della mobilit&amp;agrave; territoriale ed urbana? Il sistema dei trasporti pu&amp;ograve; essere considerato una risorsa generatrice di vantaggi competitivi per una destinazione turistica? Il framework dell&amp;rsquo;articolo &amp;egrave; rappresentato dalla teoria marshalliana del distretto industriale che pone il territorio e le sue risorse alla base dello sviluppo del sistema locale. Ad esso si tenta di sovrapporre il framework VRIO (Valore, Rarit&amp;agrave;, Inimitabilit&amp;agrave;, Organizzazione), derivato dalla Resource Based View, per stabilire se una determinata risorsa del territorio, nel caso di specie il sistemi di trasporto urbano ed extraurbano, pu&amp;ograve; generare un vantaggio competitivo sostenibile e duraturo. Per l&amp;rsquo;analisi delle problematiche dell&amp;rsquo;impatto sul territorio delle politiche di sviluppo turistico e del Destination Management &amp;egrave; utile il riferimento alla Stakeholder Theory ed un approccio Corporate Social Responsability (CSR). Date queste premesse, nel paper vengono esposti i vari contributi della letteratura specialistica sui sistemi turistici partendo dall&amp;rsquo;assunto di base che il turista &amp;egrave; un soggetto che attiva un processo di spesa di parte del suo reddito in un luogo diverso dalla sua abituale dimora. La scelta della destinazione in cui fruire dei servizi turistici e svolgere le attivit&amp;agrave; collaterali di consumo &amp;egrave; il frutto di un processo decisionale complesso basato sulla selezione competitiva tra soluzioni alternative che siano in grado di rispondere ad un insieme di bisogni ed aspirazioni a parit&amp;agrave; di costi e di livello di servizi richiesti. Successivamente viene preso in esame il modo con cui una localit&amp;agrave; geografica diviene destinazione turistica e come le caratteristiche strutturali (servizi di alloggio, ristorazione, accessori) ed infrastrutturali (accessibilit&amp;agrave; geografica, sociale ed economica) possano essere in grado di esprimere un richiamo ""emozionale"" per il turista; l&amp;rsquo;incontro tra domanda ed offerta viene visto in un&amp;rsquo;ottica postfordista secondo il framework &amp;ldquo;Mutual Value&amp;rdquo; che assegna un ruolo fondamentale alla componente dei servizi presente nell&amp;rsquo;offerta di vendita dei beni (materiali ed immateriali) per generare un vantaggio competitivo sul mercato. In prosieguo il fenomeno turistico viene messo in relazione al concetto di mobilit&amp;agrave; territoriale per evidenziare l&amp;rsquo;impatto che esso genera sul piano ambientale ed urbanistico e la necessit&amp;agrave; di monitorare il fenomeno e pianificare le azioni di adeguamento strutturale ed infrastrutturale del territorio nella direzione della sostenibilit&amp;agrave;. Infine verranno esposti dei casi di mobilit&amp;agrave; urbana ed extraurbana di tipo turistico secondo una prospettiva che vede il trasporto urbano ed extraurbano una vera e propria risorsa (VRIO) generatrice di vantaggio competitivo per il sistema locale.";"Pasquale Boccagna";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2010-11-30";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/article/view/144";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";""

as in other countries. Often, landscapes or landscape types are treated in the literature as essentialist or
at least as uncontested categories. We analyse two examples of local controversies about wind energy, in
which “landscape” is employed by supporters and opponents alike, from a poststructuralist and discourse
theoretical angle. The aim is to identify and compare landscape constructs produced in the micro discourses
of wind energy objectors and proponents at local level (a) within each case, (b) between the two cases and (c)
with landscape constructs that were previously found in macro discourses. One major finding is that several
different landscapes can exist at one and the same place. Furthermore there seems to be a relatively stable
set of competing landscape concepts which is reproduced in specific controversies. The paper concludes by
highlighting practical consequences and by identifying promising avenues of further research.";"Antje Otto";"";"International Association for Landscape Ecology (Chapter Germany";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-10-31";"en";"land use;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"DEU";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.3097/LO.201438";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.landscapeonline.de/submission-instructions";"17"

One important indicator for the evaluation of this value is the structural diversity of the landscape. Although Landscape Metrics (LM) represent a well-known instrument for the quantification of landscape patterns, they are hardly used in applied landscape and environmental planning. This study shows possibilities for the integration of LM into a commonly used method to assess scenic quality by the example of a Landscape Structure Plan. First results indicate that especially Shannon’s Diversity Index and Edge Density are suitable to achieve an objective evaluation of the structural diversity as indicator for scenic quality. The addition of qualitative parameters to the objective structural analysis is discussed. Moreover, the use of landscape scenery units and raster cells as basic geometry has been compared. It shows that LM can support the evaluation of the aesthetic quality in environmental planning, especially when integrated into commonly used evaluation methods.";"H. Herbst

Sobre sua população os sacerdotes praticavam um olhar vigilante, avaliando com atenção as mudanças que se produziam numa sociedade em ebulição, temendo sobremaneira o contato entre visitantes e visitados. Ali, o turismo estilhaçou a ordem estabelecida, perturbou as tradições, abalou os costumes ali existentes, rompeu com a confortável rotina. Entretanto, a semente da natureza enquanto atrativo turístico estava sendo preparada, valorizada inclusive pelos próprios sacerdotes. Assim, quando germina, o turismo local passa a ter um novo caminho, uma manobra astuciosa, que constrói um modelo moderno, até então não existente na cidade, afastando-se dos homens e suas construções culturais, passando a construir uma atividade onde a natureza estaria ao centro de um potente discurso total. Este ato transformador será posto em prática na década de 1950, mas apresentará um claro efeito colateral: o esquecimento da cidade e seus atrativos culturais. Todavia, a localidade não se metamorfoseava somente em seus costumes, que pareciam testados a todo o momento. A materialidade urbana, igualmente, passava por um veloz processo de ruptura entre antigo e moderno, sendo devorada pela aparente necessidade de se constituir uma imagem renovada da cidade, distanciando-se da antiga representação colonial.  Ruiria ela também, tempos depois, seguindo as tendências padronizadas, impostas pelo capitalismo imobiliário. Em meio a esse processo, a cidade é renomeada, edificando-se uma nova identidade. Surge a Cidade Veraneio. A soma desses fatores levará ao contemporâneo distanciamento entre turismo e espaço urbano, contrapondo-se à valorização turística da natureza ali existente.";"Itamar Ferretto Comarú ";"";"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2015-12-31";"pt";"land development (urbanization)";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"https://periodicos.ufrn.br/turismocontemporaneo/article/view/6940 ";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"https://periodicos.ufrn.br/turismocontemporaneo/about/submissions#copyrightNotice ";"22"
"DOAJ:46a5d4796f4141e99a5ce946fe5856d3";"NEW METHODS OF NORMATIVE MONETARY EVALUATION OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS: POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS";"";"Approaches to the normative monetary evaluation of agricultural lands, adopted by the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated March 23, 1995 No. 213, did not allow to accomplish objective actualization of the indicators, as they did not take into account changes in the economy and the system of agricultural land use that occurred during the implementation of land reform in agriculture. So there is no doubt of the necessity to take into consideration the   changes and to improve methodical approaches to the evaluation of agricultural land.

The resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated November 16, 2016 No. 831 adopted the updated ""Methodology of normative monetary evaluation of agricultural lands "".

According to the paragraph 3 of the methodology, normative monetary evaluation of agricultural lands  is determined in accordance with the requirements of capitalized rental income for agricultural lands of natural and agricultural districts of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, regions, cities of Kiev and Sevastopol in accordance with the Annex and indicators of soil evaluation by drawing up scales of normative monetary evaluation of agricultural industrial groups of soils of natural and agricultural areas (for farmlands).

The first question that arises regarding the updated methods is a natural-agricultural zoning. In fact, in this methodology there is no list of borders, natural agricultural areas in the section of the territories of village councils and settlements included in one or another area. If we use the map of the natural-agricultural zoning and the reference book to it proposed for consideration by the site of State Geocadaster of Diagrams, it contains other boundaries, and another list of village councils, settlements, for example in the section of the mentioned Radekhiv district, than the natural-agricultural zoning was previously approved. So, one of them combines 29, and others combine 2 village councils each. This reference book does not have a column regarding the name of the natural-agricultural district. It is therefore difficult to determine any areas classified as village councils as well as settlements.

Analyzing data concerning the evaluation of agricultural lands according to the old and new methods it was determined that the value of arable land in the study area decreased overall by more than 7 thousand UAH but in some areas of councils - almost by 2 times. Such a decrease in the value of land is not logical, because the production of agricultural products during 1995-2001 inthe district did not diminished, but rather increased.

New methods of normative monetary evaluation of agricultural lands for proving the objectivity of the results, requires grounding of information regarding the determination of the boundaries of natural-agricultural regions and objectivity of differentiation of indicators of capitalized rental income from the general (in Ukraine) to partial one (the land plot).";"A.

The valuation model is based on an axiological square, in which four kinds of appreciation are taken into account. A WBS pattern explains in detail each appreciation, so that every piece of the green-web can be characterized and assessed within a general framework oriented to provide the aggregate value of the path to which they relate. The DRSA tool is used to generate the preferences structure of the target segments users. It is used as basis for extracting and the processing data. It allows to identify the preferences structure to support the WebGIS tools to generate the green way that best meet the user’s preferences.";"Salvatore Giuffrida

In the light of the actual urban debate, it can be useful to do an in-depth study. In fact, the quality of urban life and collective well-being cannot be separated from the identification of a network of public services and facilities, that organizes and structures the city. That network is not resolved in the themes of pre-school and compulsory education, public interest, green spaces, car parks and public interest, but rather has a wider variety of types. Noting the failure of attempts to define, a priori, a quantity of universally valid services, it is necessary to rethink the ways and criteria of most of the infrastructural facilities. The ""Piano dei Servizi"" is the tool for the implementation of a concrete policy of services for public interest, and it means the transition between a planning standard, in terms of quantity, in a standard that meets quality requirements. It represents a specific section of the urban development plan, which has to consider problems and shortcomings, and try to solve them by finding opportunities which physical locations offer. In this way a planning standard is not configured as an abstract quantity, but as the material composition of the urban plan, which results in a land use and land development proposal.";"Roberto Gerundo

"DOAJ:bb2b10a28dab46f99d325f8bc8853d78";"Environmental indicators for evaluating properties";"";"Property evaluation for tax purposes has traditionally relied on urban and building criteria, mostly resulting from concepts driven by the commercial attractiveness of the property under evaluation, its building and the site itself. Due to the world climate and ecological crisis, awareness has risen about the need for other indicators, which can evaluate the quality of a property, even referring to its potential environmental impact.
Technical standards for the evaluation of buildings’ environmental sustainability, which have been developed since the first years of this century, both nationally and internationally, take into account the impact of the building and its relevance for the life-cycle of materials and elements, with reference to the three sectors of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. The social sector includes indicators referring to the user’s health and comfort, which also interact with the morphological and spatial characteristics of the building.
However, there is a lack of methodological tools for the evaluation of said indicators and existing ones are mainly of a qualitative type. This paper suggests a methodological approach for the quantitative evaluation of sustainability indicators, relying on the accessibility of a site’s climate resources by the property, as a criterion to evaluate the potential for the reduction of negative environmental impact, as well as a criterion to improve users’ life quality.";"Mario Grosso

"DOAJ:5d53eafba63d4d238944dd15fb1fba8c";"LAND MANAGEMENT REGULATION AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR PLANNING IN UKRAINE";"";"The presence of problems in the territorial management of land indicates that the system of state and municipal management does not meet the modern requirements of sustainable (balanced) development. The explanation is simple - if the planning of the development of territories of settlements takes place on the basis of approved urban planning documentation (master plans), then the territory of land tenure and land use outside their borders is notfully covered by development of land management documentation.

In this regard, the importance of the development and implementation of land management regulations at the practical level as an important land-use planning tool is substantiated.

Essential and meaningful signs of the concepts of ""urban planning regulations"", ""land management regulations"" for conducting researchesare found.

The National Standard defines the concept of urban planning regulations, such as the use of land plots, established within the respective territorial zones and defines the types of preferential and related use of land, the limits of permitted construction, reconstruction of construction objects and is used in the design, construction and subsequent operation of Objects.

The draft law of Ukraine ""On zoning of land"" proposed the definition of land management regulations as approved in accordance with the established procedure text materials, that determine the parameters of the permitted use of land (land use regime) and acceptable changes in these parameters. However, this draft law is not harmonized during the 10-year period at the state level, therefore the proposed terms and definitions do not fully comply with modern requirements. Therefore, it is proposed to supplement them with other terms and definitions.

Based on the research carried out, the author's definition of land management regulations should be understood as the procedure for land use, which is established within the respective territorial zones, with the definition of the legal regime of the territory of land use, which specifies the boundaries of the land plot, restrictions on the land use and the types and parameters of permitted land use, types of predominant and concomitant use of land plots, which indicate prohibited activities and responsibilities in relation to taking certain actions.

It’s established that land management regulations should become an integral part of the land management project on land zoning. For this purpose, a methodological approach to the formation of the legal regime of land use in land zoning according to their categories is proposed. The given division of land by types and subtypes of land use will allow to properly form territorial restrictions on land use with subsequent differentiation to land plots.

A combination of urban planning and land management regulations will contribute to the achievement of sustainable (balanced) land use.";"O. Dorosh

remote sensing techniques. Information on LULC is needed for the assessment of ecosystem services and
is used as input data for mapping and modelling. This information is important for decision-making and
management of ecosystems and landscapes. In this study, LULC were analysed in two agricultural areas in
Northern Germany by means of a pixel-based maximum likelihood classification approach of 11 Landsat
TM 5 scenes between 1987 and 2011 followed by a post-classification refinement using the tool IRSeL. In
this time period, grassland declined by about 50 % in both case study areas. This loss in grassland area can
be associated with changes in provisioning ecosystem services as the supply of fodder and crops and the
number of livestock declined from 1987 to 2007. Furthermore, an on-going increase in maize cultivation
area, which is nowadays more and more used as biomass for biogas production, documents the addition of
another provisioning service, i.e., biomass for energy. Combining remote sensing and research on ecosystem
services supports the assessment and monitoring of ecosystem services on different temporal, spatial, and

Entende-se a importância do território e a valorização das particularidades à medida em que se procura dar ênfase ao heterogêneo e entender a diversidade regional como potencialidade. A região deve ser entendida como particularidade dinâmica, na qual as ações endógenas presentes no território ganham força. Nesse sentido, observa-se que a região Extremo Sul teve, no seu processo de formação, fatores históricos estruturantes que influenciaram as características da região, ainda perceptíveis no seu contexto atual. A abordagem teórico-metodológica referenciada no materialismo histórico dialético apoiou-se na pesquisa qualitativa, com ênfase no estudo de caso, utilizando a análise de conteúdo como procedimento de interpretação de dados. Observou-se, a partir das entrevistas com os gestores públicos do turismo na região, que existe a compreensão de que é preciso atuar de forma regionalizada, contudo a região ainda sofre com a falta de protagonismo dos gestores em desenvolver ações para dinamizar e desenvolver o potencial regional. Por fim, compreender o território no contexto do planejamento e gestão do turismo requer buscar respeitar, nas ações de planejamento, os aspectos que particularizam determinado território, ou seja, perceber as particularidades como potencialidades para o turismo.

The case study of the Amalfi Coast";"";"Cultural landscapes are a key resource for sustainable development. Among them, terraced landscapes are classified as “evolutive living” landscapes (UNESCO, 2012), an expression of the historical interrelationship between man and his territory. Currently many terraced landscapes are considered at risk because of the changed socio-economic conditions. The need for conservation and effective management of change of this exceptional heritage poses the question of identification of functions and complex values of the landscape, taking into account the needs, views and preferences of local communities. This study aims to identify the terraced landscape values and services based on the ecosystem services theory. It is addressed the issue of evaluation and mapping of cultural services in
terraced landscape, with reference to the site of the Amalfi Coast in Campania. The categories of services have been evaluated with the involvement of the local community through a semi-structured questionnaire administered online. The integration of multi-criteria evaluation and spatial analysis in GIS (Geographic
Information System) has led to the construction of maps of cultural services, which allow displaying the complex relations that link communities to the landscape. The tools for collaborative mapping (Volunteered Geographic Information – VGI) have been used for the construction of some of the maps of cultural services, integrating the results of the questionnaire with data related to the direct experience of the users.";"Antonia Gravagnuolo";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-06-30";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_1_16_5e";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"25"

On the other hand, air emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines can be regarded as a negative pressure over the environment. In the coming decades, road transport is likely to remain a significant contributor to air pollution in cities. Many urban trips cover distances of less than 6 km. Since the effectiveness of catalytic converters in the initial minutes of engine operation is small, the average emission per distance driven is very high in urban areas. Also, poorly maintained vehicles that lack exhaust aftertreatment systems are responsible for a major part of pollutant emissions. Therefore in urban areas, where higher concentrations of vehicles can be easily found, air pollution represents a critical issue, being it related with both environment and human health protection: in truth, research in recent decades consistently indicates the adverse effects of outdoor air pollution on human health, and the evidence points to air pollution stemming from transport as an important contributor to these effects. Several institutions (EEA, USEPA, etc.) focused their interest in dispersion models because of their potential effectiveness to forecast atmospheric pollution. Furthermore, air micropollutants such as Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds (PAH) and Metallic Trace Elements (MTE) are traffic-related and although very low concentrations their dispersion is a serious issue. However, dispersion models are usefully implemented to better manage this estimation problem. Nonetheless, policy makers and land managers have to deal with model selection, taking into account that several dispersion models are available, each one of them focused on specific goals (e.g., wind transport of pollutants, land morphology implementation, evaluation of micropollutants transport, etc.); a further aspect to be considered is the model scale: not every model can be usefully implemented in all conditions, e.g. for a careful simulation of the transport of pollutants in a range of 50 – 500 m, it is recommended to select Lagrangian or Eulerian tridimensional models, instead of Gaussian models, which may be preferable to simulate dispersion over longer distances. In addition, emission factors have to be evaluated as well, considering that nowadays vehicles release pollutants in the environment depending on both their engine and technological innovation level. Dispersion models are commonly used in order to define pressures on the environment, although phenomenon complexity and numerous interactions require continuous innovation. The paper aims to explain dispersion models implementation and to introduce the most used models available for both the transport sector and the GHG emissions in order to help land managers to better assess air quality thanks to a deeper comprehension of pollutants dispersion.";"Davide Scannapieco

model and landscape metrics have been the predominant approach to describe the spatial arrangement
of discrete elements (“patches”) for the last two decades. However, the widely used approach of using landscape
metrics for characterizing categorical map patterns is connected with a number of problems. We aim at stimulating

review of existing techniques and clarifying their pros and cons as well as demonstrating how to extent common
approaches in landscape ecology (e.g. the patch-corridor-matrix model). The extension into the third dimension
means adding information on the relief and height of vegetation, while the fourth dimension means the temporal,
dynamic aspect of landscapes. The contribution is structured around three main topics: the third dimension of
landscapes, the fourth dimension of landscapes, and spatial and temporal scales in landscape analysis. Based on
the results of a symposium on this theme at the IALE conference in 2009 in Salzburg and a literature review we
emphasize the need to add topographic information into evaluations of landscape structure, the appropriate consideration
of scales; and to consider the ambiguity and even contradiction between landscape metrics.";"Lucian Drăguţ

Assim, o objetivo deste artigo é o de descrever as práticas alimentares locais tradicionais e as inovações introduzidas em diferentes contextos históricos, entre outros, no de sua adesão ao turismo. Metodologicamente associada à História Oral, os dados da pesquisa foram coletados em entrevistas semiestruturadas, pesquisa documental e observação realizada na festa 35º Noite Italiana. Durante o processo analítico, os dados foram listados em indicadores associados à Inovação e Diversidade Cultural, dois princípios da economia criativa brasileira. Conclui-se que a comida hoje apresentada ao turista como ""italiana"", resulta de um imaginário de italianidade associado as identidades locais, que atualizam o que, em outro momento histórico, foi o alimento diário de Antônio Prado.";"Susana Gastal

The proper design and location of parking facilities, in fact, contributes to an efficient use of the transportation system (or it may reduce its efficiency, when these infrastructures are not properly planned). This paper discusses the role of parking as part of the policy packages for strategic planning aimed at increasing the sustainability of urban and metropolitan areas. In particular, the integration of parking strategies in a comprehensive vision for the future of a city may significantly improve the allocation of resources and the reduction of the overall environmental externalities. The role of parking in the strategic planning of cities is discussed through the analysis of several recent projects in the city of Bari (Italy). The paper discusses the way these projects are linked (or eventually not linked) to broader strategies for urban mobility, and how they might be coordinated into policy packages that promote more sustainable transportation. The use of an integrated land use transportation modeling approach to simulate the long-term evolution of the urban area may significantly contribute to estimate the long-term effects of the proposed policies. This approach may successfully support the process of policy evaluation and the selection of the optimal strategies to implement.";"Giovanni Circella";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2010-04-30";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/120";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";""

O cenário é produto da insegurança alimentar gerada pelo distanciamento da agricultura local das áreas adjacentes ao espaço urbano, contexto já identificado em algumas civilizações no passado. Sob a perspectiva, assume-se que ações de planejamento urbano devem estar integradas a estratégias de produção de alimentos a incluir iniciativas em favor da agricultura urbana e periurbana, e de práticas da permacultura. A considerar tais premissas, o objetivo da pesquisa é demonstrar os desafios do planejamento urbano no Brasil quando analisado sob a ótica da agricultura urbana. Entende-se a necessidade de assumir novos conceitos e modelos de composição do espaço, associados à permacultura e sua prática experimental, considerando a integração dos contextos urbanos (zonas intraurbanas, periurbanas e rurais) que atualmente não apresentam claras inter-relações. Para aproximar o estudo à realidade brasileira foram analisadas, conjuntamente, as políticas sociais do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e os marcos legais das políticas urbanas, a incluir o Estatuto da Cidade (Lei 10.257/2001) e a Lei 6.766/1979. Os resultados apontam que há uma lacuna quanto às ações e práticas de agricultura urbana no âmbito legal de uso e ocupação do solo e, portanto, sugerem-se algumas diretrizes de aplicação.

The climate change process is providing an uncertain future, supporting the forecast of big cities collapse. The scenery is product of the food insecurity issue generated by the distance between the local farmers and the urban surrounding areas, a situation already reported in civilizations in the past. Considering this perspective, it is assumed that urban planning actions must be integrated to food production strategies such as urban and peri-urban agriculture and permaculture practices. Based on these premises, this paper aims at demonstrating the challenges of the urban planning in Brazil when analyzed under the urban agriculture point of view. It is clear the necessity of assuming new concepts and models to organize urban spaces, associated with permaculture and its experimental practice, considering the integration of urban contexts (intraurban, peri-urban and rural zones) that nowadays are not properly related. In order to develop a Brazilian approach, the social policies of the Ministry of Social Development and the urban policies legal framework – the Estatuto da Cidade (Law 10.257/2001) and Law 6.766/1979 were analyzed. The results point that there is a gap regarding the urban agriculture actions and practices in the legal context related to land use.

Specific institution is the military institutе in the institutional framework for defense land. A special regime and zoning, evaluation, payment and exclusion conditions were established for these lands.

The market economy has changed the land-property relations in the country. Lands for defense used only in the framework that established the state. Recently there was a tendency of land release this subcategory. This has led to their misuse, belonging to other owners. The research problem consists of the setting clear boundaries of defense land and legal regulation mechanisms of land relations.

Public ownership rights applies only to the defense lands. They are located only in the state ownership. The subject is the state that implements ownership (right to possess, use and dispose of the lands of Defense). It ensures the defense of the country and territory for military sites, airfields, parts, ammunition depots. Functional use of defense land is divided into public (military schools), socio-cultural (health centers, recreation centers), industrial (military and industrial objects), residential (cantonment), commercial (commissary), special (military installations), transport ( carpark, bridges), engineering (antennas, radars), storage (defense deport). The land  for  military unit were given for permanent use with the justification of the project design documentation sizes. The military part of the land for permanent use with the justification sizes by the project design documentation.  Safety, security and other areas are created around military and other defense installations.

There are restricted areas, prohibited areas. They have a special regime. Reform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the State Special Transport Service leads to the release of land and real estate. Reform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the State Special Transport Service leads to the release of land and real estate. Military depots with fuel for rockets and other types of substances, military training grounds are dangerous both for people and for the ecological situation of the environment. If in the future they will not be used for their intended purpose, they should be brought to its original state.

This land is advisable to assign a recovery mode, which provides clearing from dangerous objects and substances. After these steps, you can change their intended purpose. These funds come from the alienation of the State budget exclusively for defense purposes. Land alienated at land auctions. Contractor of land sales is determined on a competitive basis. He receives from the CMU authority to the exclusion of military property. He must have a license to conduct land auctions. He must conclude the two treaties: the first - with the organizer about their carrying out, and the second - with the Ministry of Defence (in terms of the implementation of real military equipment of objects).

The literature focuses on the preferences in relation to physical and demographic aspects, such as land uses, facilities, transportation facilities, transportation services, car ownership, income, household size and travel accessibility. However, this study suggests social and cultural issue such as racial diversity which is literally to be a significance context. The case study reported here is based on Iskandar Malaysia’s development region. Reliability Analysis and Factor Analysis are applied to determine that religious and culture are influential in terms of residential location preferences. These findings add a different perspective on travel behavior studies, which are heavily dominated by researches from Western Europe, North America and Australasia.

Después de constatar que los nuevos procedimientos para incorporar suelo de propiedad social al crecimiento ordenado de las ciudades no han sido suficientemente exitosos para disminuir su ocupación irregular, se concluye que ello se debe a dos razones principales: en primer lugar, se mantiene una sobrerregulación del Estado sobre los propietarios de las tierras ejidales y comunales, que es necesario eliminar; y en segundo término, la capacidad de los gobiernos municipales para ordenar y planificar el desarrollo urbano es todavía muy limitada, debido a que los avances reales de la reforma municipal de 1983 han sido insuficientes. Para finalizar, se sugiere plantear en nuevos términos la noción de reservas territoriales, y se apuntan las grandes áreas de la administración municipal en las que es necesario centrar esfuerzos<br>It is discussed how the legislative reform of the Article 27 in 1992 in Mexico affected the urban land management, particularly, the forms of creating urban reserves from ejido land. As it is shown, the new mechanisms under which ejido land may be disestablished in order to prevent irregular urban growth, mainly by informal alienation proccess, have been unsuccessfully. Two main aspects explain these results. Firstly, ejidatarios still not have the complete autonomy to control their own land by themselves; instead, federal and states govenments still maintain several options to modify the ejidatarios decisions. Secondly, planning agencies and municipal governments frequently have a low administrative and financial capacity, to exercise effective authority over land development processes.

Nell’ambito del progetto SEEMPubS (Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Spaces), conclusosi ad agosto del 2013, è stata analizzata, dal punto di vista teorico ed operativo, la possibilità di utilizzare un network di sensori per il monitoraggio dei consumi e di incrementare la consapevolezza relativa ai consumi energetici da parte degli utenti degli ambienti di studio e di lavoro. L’evoluzione di tale progetto è rappresentata dall’avvio del progetto DIMMER (District Information Modeling and Management for Energy Reduction) il 1 ottobre 2013, nel quale il livello di analisi viene esteso dall’edificio (scala edilizia) al quartiere/distretto (scala urbana) ampliando contemporaneamente i settori di analisi.

Namely, the setting up of policies for increasing mobility, reducing its adverse impacts, has been assumed as one of the main European goal for gaining the challenge of international competition. Hence, from the end of the Nineties, the EU addressed its efforts towards the identification of innovative solutions for a sustainable urban mobility, promoting research and initiatives in multiple areas, from transport infrastructures to traffic management, from public transport services to urban planning. The European documents set up starting from 2000, the results achieved by the European research and the guidelines provided by the Seventh Framework Programme point out the need for overcoming the sectorial approach which has for long characterized transport planning and policies. At present, grounding on integrated approaches, new ideas and practices are emerging, driving towards a closer relation between transport planning and land use planning at different scales. Nevertheless, in the European strategies and researches, the solution to the difficult relation among cities, mobility and environment is, up to now, mainly committed to the integration among sectorial policies grounded on knowledge and competencies still very far one from each other. The awareness that an effective integration requires new areas of interdisciplinary thinking and competencies and innovative practices and tools, is still weak.<br>Il rapporto citt&amp;agrave;, mobilit&amp;agrave; e ambiente ha assunto nell&amp;rsquo;ultimo decennio un ruolo centrale nelle strategie, nelle iniziative e nei programmi di ricerca dell&amp;rsquo;Unione Europea.

A tal fine, a partire dalla fine degli anni Novanta, l&amp;rsquo;Europa ha indirizzato i propri sforzi verso l&amp;rsquo;identificazione di soluzioni innovative per una mobilit&amp;agrave; urbana sostenibile, promuovendo ricerche e iniziative in settori molteplici, dalle infrastrutture di trasporto alla regolamentazione e gestione del traffico, dai servizi di trasporto pubblico alla pianificazione urbana. I principali documenti prodotti in ambito europeo dal 2000 ad oggi, gli esiti dei programmi di ricerca e gli indirizzi per le future attivit&amp;agrave; di ricerca delineati nel settimo Programma Quadro sottolineano la necessit&amp;agrave; di superare la settorialit&amp;agrave; cui &amp;egrave; stata a lungo improntata la pianificazione dei trasporti per delineare approcci, pratiche e strumenti, basati su una visione integrata del rapporto citt&amp;agrave;, mobilit&amp;agrave; e ambiente e orientati ad una pi&amp;ugrave; stretta correlazione tra pianificazione dei trasporti e pianificazione urbana e territoriale. Risulta tuttavia ancora debole, nelle strategie e nelle prospettive di ricerca delineate per il prossimo futuro dall&amp;rsquo;Unione Europea, la consapevolezza che la risoluzione del difficile rapporto citt&amp;agrave;, mobilit&amp;agrave; e ambiente richiede non solo una maggiore integrazione tra politiche di settore, frutto di un coordinamento tra scelte effettuate sulla base di saperi e competenze ancora troppo distanti, quanto l&amp;rsquo;effettivo superamento della separazione tra ambiti disciplinari tradizionalmente disgiunti e l&amp;rsquo;individuazione di nuovi campi di riflessione, nuove professionalit&amp;agrave; da cui potranno emergere approcci, strumenti e pratiche realmente innovative.";"Adriana Galderisi";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2007-12-31";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/article/view/20";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";""

Indubitavelmente, a atividade turística tem grande importância para a economia mundial, sendo uma alternativa de grande valor para muitos lugares que não possuem potencial nos setores primário e secundário, mas possuem recursos naturais e/ou grande valor histórico. Além da importância econômica, o turismo também possui grande valor sociocultural e psicossocial, pois lida com sonhos, realizações, conhecimento e troca de experiências culturais. E, assim como no turismo, a terceira idade se mostra com mais força e exigente em relação às atividades de lazer, saúde, prestação de serviços, políticas e educação. Tal segmentação tem ganhado bastante destaque, pois está promovendo a qualidade de vida e, consequentemente, a longevidade. Através de uma pesquisa de natureza exploratória-descritiva, a partir de um estudo de caso, o presente estudo teve como objetivo principal, investigar os fatores motivacionais que impulsionam a realização da atividade turística de idosos na cidade de Manaus. Neste, foram entrevistados 20 idosos de um grupo da terceira idade, frequentadores de um Centro Estadual de Convivência do Idoso. Os dados foram analisados qualitativamente, organizados em categorias temáticas, dentre estes pudemos verificar as principais necessidades encontradas pelos idosos que realizam viagens, fatores motivacionais que estimulam a atividade turística na terceira idade de um centro de convivência da cidade de Manaus e a compreensão da contribuição do público idoso para o turismo.

Un’innovazione finanziaria per gli investimenti immobiliari";"";"Questo articolo presenta una panoramica del crowdfunding e delle sue potenziali applicazioni al settore immobiliare. La crisi economica globale del 2008 ha condotto a una paralisi dell’economia che ha comportato la riduzione della fiducia nel sistema bancario e nei servizi finanziari in generale. Nell’ultimo decennio una delle tecniche di finanziamento più rivoluzionaria è stata il crowdfunding, cioè la possibilità di essere finanziati dalla “folla” (crowd) attraverso l’utilizzo di Internet. Il crowdfunding nel settore immobiliare ha origine negli Stati Uniti nel 2012 con il Jumpstart Our Business Start-up Act (JOBS Act), dove da allora si sta sviluppando a ritmi elevati. In Italia, il crowdfunding per progetti nel settore immobiliare non si è ancora sviluppato in quanto la legge in concreto non ne consente l’utilizzo; tuttavia esistono alcune piattaforme che stanno utilizzando il concetto in modi differenti, raccogliendo un certo interesse. Il Real Estate Crowdfunding può rappresentare un’interessante opportunità per i privati che vogliono investire nel settore immobiliare, ma non hanno abbastanza capitale per partecipare a grandi transazioni
o esperienza nella gestione. In quest’articolo, dopo un’iniziale descrizione del crowdfunding in generale, ci si focalizza sulla sua
applicazione nel settore immobiliare, analizzando il mercato statunitense dove vi sono le piattaforme più sviluppate. Infine, si presenta una panoramica del mercato italiano, spiegando le normative e i limiti del crowdfunding e descrivendo la modalità operativa sviluppata da alcune piattaforme per superare legalmente
tali limitazioni. Negli Stati Uniti sono già operative oltre 125 piattaforme con una raccolta superiore a un miliardo di dollari; in Italia invece ci sono ancora limiti per le start-up che si occupano di crowdfunding e sono state create solo poche piattaforme che operano con un modello parzialmente diverso.

Apesar de também ser comercializado por vendedores ambulantes nas principais praias do litoral natalense, o Mercado Público da Redinha é o ponto original onde se comercializa esse prato. Muitos turistas que visitam a capital potiguar desejam conhecer a gastronomia típica, mas o mercado atrai especialmente turistas locais e moradores como opção de entretenimento. Realizou-se um estudo de natureza quantitativa descritiva, cujos dados foram obtidos através de formulário composto por 15 questões respondidas por 31 usuários do Mercado. Para análise, as questões foram organizadas em categorias que abrangeram o perfil dos usuários e suas opiniões em relação à infraestrutura do mercado, à frequência de visitação, meio de divulgação que os levou a conhecer o Mercado, percepção sobre qualidade de acesso e demandas de melhorias. Em relação à gastronomia, indagou-se sobre o cardápio servido, o gosto e apresentação do prato, o valor cobrado e a opinião sobre a qualidade do atendimento. Os resultados evidenciaram pontos negativos como a falta de saneamento adequado e regular que também comprometia a higiene; bem como a falta de infraestrutura como principal reclamação entre os entrevistados. Em relação aos pontos positivos foram incluídos: preço justo, bom atendimento e gosto agradável do prato. A maioria dos entrevistados indicaria o mercado a outros e, apesar dos diversos problemas apontados, os usuários, especialmente, do sexo masculino, são atraídos em busca da ginga com tapioca para beber com amigos na semana. A revisão da dinâmica interna do Mercado pode fomentar como estratégia para incluí-lo no roteiro do turismo gastronômico regional.";"Charllys de Oliveira Lima

The key subject is how to allocate optimized weight into effective parameters upon urban growth and subsequently achieving an improved simulation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithm was used to allocate the weight via an iteration approach. In this way, weight allocation was carried out by the ANN training accomplishing through time-series satellite images representing urban growth process. Cellular Automata (CA) was used as the principal motor of the model and then ANN applied to find suitable scale of parameters and relations between potential factors affecting urban growth.

This is why several public entities worldwide are promoting new strategies and adopted innovating approaches such as the Building Information Modelling (BIM). Countries like the UK, Germany, France and Spain are working on it through investments in the industry digitalization. In Italy, despite the fact that the growing implementation of information-based technologies is not supported by a governmental strategy, public calls for tender requiring BIM have been set up. In addition, in order to benefit from a BIM-based approach, cooperating processes are being arranged to involve several parties from the very first stages of the project itself. This way flaws will be sorted out in advance and out of the construction site, and at the same time ideal solutions will be identified for the entire building lifecycle. Within the BIM methodology, a key role is played by Model Checking, which enables verification and validation of all projects, not only in the design phase, but also throughout the process phases. In order to guarantee reliable results, an initial pre-check should be carried out, the so called BIM Validation. This validates the data content of the Information Model and subsequently carries out analyses such as Clash Detection and Code Checking. The Information Model must come out of a meticulous modelling phase, in order to validate its geometric and alphanumeric content and ensure reliable results first, and then proceed with subsequent BIM-based analyses.";"Angelo Luigi Camillo Ciribini

associated legal opportunity to develop new traffic noise protection measures, this study investigated
properties of sustainable noise abatement in a community next to the A8. A two-stage empirical survey
was conducted integrating a citizen and an expert Delphi survey. The results show that the noise from
the motorway heavily affects the quality of life in health, economic and ecological respects. Sustainable
noise abatement should take into consideration ecological and social aspects like landscape integration
and contribution to local development due to the unique location of the municipality. Enclosed motorway
canopies are particularly beneficial to meet these criteria. The costs for sustainable noise abatement
measures should be weighted as less important; however, financial costs are crucial for the federal
government due to the requirements of the Federal Pollution Control Act. Hence, residents and experts
assume that noise barriers as the cheaper noise abatement measures will be implemented. However, the
results of the study and the latest developments in the expansion plans suggest that the implementation of
enclosed motorway canopies, which go beyond the legal requirements, is feasible through extensive citizen
participation and community-specific planning.

Dall’approvazione di tale suddivisione della città in segmenti territoriali omogenei sono trascorsi 18 anni, un periodo di tempo in cui il tessuto della città si è modificato, sia sul piano urbanistico sia a causa delle variazioni importanti del mercato immobiliare, prima fra tutte la crisi economico-finanziaria che ha comportato una costante decrescita dei prezzi dal 2010 ad oggi. Negli ultimi anni, propedeuticamente all’aggiornamento delle Microzone, l’Osservatorio Immobiliare della Città di Torino (OICT) ha condotto una serie di studi tra cui la sub-segmentazione delle Microzone in Porzione Porzioni Territoriali Storiche (PTS), individuate sulla base di una lettura storico-urbanistica del territorio senza mettere in discussione i confini delle Microzone.
L’obiettivo del presente articolo è quello di illustrare le PTS e verificare quale apporto può dare un’unità territoriale più piccola delle Microzone alla spiegazione dei prezzi, tenendo conto che al diminuire dell’estensione dell’ambito territoriale, ci si deve confrontare con campioni di dati sempre meno numerosi e rappresentativi.
Al fine di studiare la capacità esplicativa della variabile posizionale, unitamente a una serie di variabili relative alle caratteristiche delle unità immobiliari e degli edifici, nella formazione dei prezzi si è applicato un modello edonico su un campione di unità immobiliari offerte sul mercato nel quadriennio 2013-2016. In particolare, a partire dalla sub-segmentazione territoriale delle Microzone in PTS, si è applicato un modello edonico tradizionale: nella prima applicazione si è assunta quale variabile posizionale la “Microzona” , mentre nella seconda la “PTS”.
Entrambe le applicazioni hanno generato risultati significativi, con coefficienti di determinazione (Adjusted R2) elevati e un’ottima capacità esplicativa delle variabili considerate. La “location”, il cui peso è riconosciuto storicamente anche a livello internazionale, continua a essere, anche nelle fasi di crisi del mercato immobiliare, una delle caratteristiche più determinanti nella formazione dei prezzi di offerta, sia considerata  attraverso la Microzona, sia attraverso la PTS.";"Rocco Curto

For the long run, we propose a preliminary analysis on the existence of a “convergence” process among Italian regional house prices series.
From the empirical point of view we implement, for both periods, a principal components technique and a panel data model using a time series (from the first half year 2000 to second half year 2011) of a cross section (19 regions) released by Real Estate Market Observatory belonging to the Italian Revenue Agency.

The Need for a Paradigm Shift";"";"Transit oriented development (TOD) has gained popularity as a means to address urbanizations problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution and affordable housing strategies. It simply refers to integration of urban development and public transportation facilities, together with some other characteristics such as “intensified land uses near TOD stations”, “landownership and car-ownership variety”, mixed use, “lower car dependency”, compact form, mass transit stations, open spaces, walkability, etc.
The major contention of this paper is to discuss the general concept of TOD, its benefits and challenges in Iranian urban context. It is discussed here that TOD has several positive outcomes considering the existing urbanization trends in Iran. It may be used as a practical instrument to deal with rapidly urbanizing country in which motorization rate is increasing and air pollution is the serious cause of life loss. However there are several challenges which should be faced. The need for an Iranian version of TOD, which re-narrated the theory according to local situation, is the first challenge. A paradigm shift in the government, shifting the priority from housing schemes to mass transit systems is the second challenge needed to be taken into consideration. The third challenge is the overlapping and parallel institutions dealing with mass transit systems in urban and regional transportation planning and insufficient planning instruments. The integrated transportation and urban planning system is necessary here, and there is an urgent need to develop a national TOD guideline with the potential to develop local versions for each city.";"Mahta Mirmoghtadaee";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-10-31";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"IRN";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/3923";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"11"

Despite significant advances in transport technology and fuel formulation, transport energy consumption has increased in most EU countries over the last three decades. This increase in consumption occurred as a result of factors such as higher car ownership, a growth in automobile use and an increase in vehicle distances traveled. As travel and land-use are a function of one another, it is often hypothesized that changing urban structure can result in changes in energy consumption. Understanding how different land use characteristics may influence travel behaviour and the corresponding energy consumption is crucial for planners and policy makers in order to develop strategic actions to shrink the environmental footprint of the urban transportation sector. The aim of this article is to review the current literature on the connections between land use, travel behavior and energy consumption. In particular, this paper seeks to identify the determinants of transport energy consumption in urban areas by reviewing evidence from empirical studies. To this aim, nine characteristics of land use are presented and their effects on both travel behaviour and energy use are discussed Our review shown that, in contrast to the focus on the effect of the built environment on travel, only few researchers have empirically investigated the linkage between the built environment and transportation energy use. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: Tahoma;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">The research described in this paper has been developed within the </span><span style=""font-size: small;"">PON</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">04a2_E </span><span style=""font-size: small;"">Smart Energy Master project.

Impact on Industrial Buildings Property Values";"";"<p>Infrastructures, through externalities, modify the territorial status quo: by creating advantages and disadvantages, they lead to inequalities and territorial cohesion problems, calling for a setup of territorial equalization mechanisms. In this paper, the estimation of the costs and benefits generated from the building of the new Cispadana regional motorway (Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy) is described. The study focuses on the price variations of the industrial buildings property values in the real estate market after the new motorway will be built, aiming at developing a forecasting method, which could be repeatable and applicable to other kinds of externalities. Thanks to the hedonic pricing method, which is recurring in transport literature, using a multiple linear regression model based on ordinary least squares method (OLS), the contribution of the accessibility on the industrial buildings' pricing has been isolated; it was then possible to forecast the rise in the industrial buildings prices that will be due to the accessibility variation produced by the new infrastructure. The purpose of such a procedure is the setup of equalization mechanisms, which can re-balance the territorial effects though he so-called “land value capture” tools. Thanks to a relatively quick phase of development and implementation, the  described application could be used as a tool for the ex-ante evaluation of different infrastructure projects and as an ex-post analysis tool for the monitoring of an existing infrastructure. Finally, thanks to the chance to understand the contribution of each territorial feature to the final price of the good, this application could be very useful in participatory planning processes because it could provide a common knowledge base which could be used to support the public administration’s capability of negotiation with the private partner, both in the  participatory planning processes and in the public-private partnership procedures.</p>";"Simona Tondelli

Considering the methodological approach to the establishment of ecological networks we can constitute, that it is an environmental frame of spatial infrastructure, land conservation and environmental areas, major part of land is the basis of the structural elements of ecological network.

Designing an ecological network is made through developing regional schemes of Econet formation, regional and local schemes for establishing an ecological network areas, settlements and other areas.

Land Management uses design of structural elements of the ecological network in the village council, as a rule, begins with ecological and landscape mikrozonationof the village council, held during the preparatory work for the land drafting and finishing the formation of environmentally homogeneous regions, which represents the tied system components of ecological network, environmental measures in the form of local environmental restrictions (encumbrances) to use land and other natural resources. Additionally, there are some project organization and territorial measures that increase the sustainability area, such as: key, binders, buffer areas and renewable ecological network.

- Protection zones along telecommunication lines, power, land transport, around industrial facilities to ensure normal conditions and reduce their impact on people and the environment, adjacent land and other natural objects;

- Sanitary protection zones around facilities that are open and underground water sources, water intake and water treatment plants, water pipes, facilities and other recreational purposes, for their sanitary-epidemiological protection;

- Buffer zones around facilities that are sources of harmful substances, odors, increased levels of noise, vibration, ultrasonic and electromagnetic waves, electronic fields, ionizing radiation, etc., to the separation of objects from residential buildings;

Las categorías del análisis remiten a cuatro familias de acción colectiva: acción reivindicativa, participación institucional, acción comunitaria y lógica de ruptura. El artículo muestra que las características del movimiento social en los períodos analizados corresponden a articulaciones particulares de estas orientaciones a la acción. El período de las primeras ocupaciones de terrenos está dominado por una lógica puramente reivindicativa, que subordina la participación institucional y se apoya en la comunidad. En el período de la promoción popular la iniciativa institucional y política se articula con la organización comunitaria, a la vez que intenta canalizar la acción lógica reivindicativa, mientras que esta última se vincula con acciones rupturistas. Durante la Unidad Popular el movimiento está dominado por la asociación de una lógica reivindicativa y la mantención de la institucionalización, cuya expresión típica son los campamentos. La acción comunitaria pasa a un segundo plano, mientras que la lógica de ruptura no se articula con los elementos anteriores. La acción de los pobladores en los 80 se organiza sobre la base de la crisis de la acción reivindicativa y la institucionalización; la prioridad otorgada a los sentimientos comunitarios se acerca, de forma minoritaria pero real, a las fuerzas de ruptura revolucionaria<br>What does characterize the collective action of Santiago's pobladores from 1957 to 1987 as the action of a social movement? I propose an analytical framework of four orientations that organize the collective action of pobladores: negotiation of urban rights, institutional participation, community action and revolutionary politics. The history of this urban social movement yields different hierarchies of these elements in the organization of its action. Early land seizures are a negotiation of rights supported by an active community; this nuclei subordinates the relationship to the institutions of the political system. In the years of populism the state initiative tied to a myriad of community organizations outshines the negotiation of rights that, at some point, shows its links to revolutionary politics. In the days of Allende, pobladores channel their negotiation of rights to an institutional arena that pervaded community life; revolutionary politics is somewhat isolated from the mainstream.

The ageing pioneers of Maurepas";"";"Construites à partir des années 1960 sous l’impulsion du Schéma directeur d’Aménagement et d’Urbanisme de 1965, cinq villes nouvelles ont vu le jour en région parisienne. Leur aménagement laisse entrevoir une volonté de répondre à des besoins urbains identifiés, se conjuguant parfois avec l’offre d’espaces, de services ou d’équipements envisagés alors comme novateurs. Maurepas, rattachée jusqu’en 1984 à l’agglomération nouvelle de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, a été façonnée en partie par ces aspirations. Elle constitue aujourd’hui une commune à la population vieillissante et à l’urbanisme marqué par des jeux d’échelle, des cloisonnements et par une relative uniformité. La configuration de la ville laisse entrevoir la volonté d’ébaucher « un nouveau genre de vie urbaine »(Pachaud, 2006) manifeste durant les années soixante et soixante-dix tandis que l’histoire de la commune permet d’envisager les difficultés inhérentes à l’intercommunalité. Au cœur de cette histoire se retrouvent des ménages de la classe moyenne, entrés dans le périurbain comme des pionniers. Portés par l’idéologie d’une ville-nouvelle où « tout est à construire » et qui leur ouvrait, parallèlement, des perspectives nouvelles en termes « d’espaces à soi », ces derniers sont aujourd’hui âgés de plus de soixante ans. Quarante ans après leur installation, leurs discours sur la ville révèlent l’existence de plusieurs ordres de tension : tension entre ruralité et urbanité, d’une part, tension entre adhésion, différenciation et réflexivité, de l’autre. Ces tensions peuvent être mises en parallèle avec les évolutions de la ville et la façon dont les formes urbaines sont mises en question dans l’espace des débats publics. Ces différents éléments nous conduiront à envisager les résistances et les projections à l’œuvre ainsi que les processus de subjectivation qu’elles révèlent parfois.<br>Through the impetus of the 1965 “Schéma directeur d’Aménagement et d’Urbanisme” (Strategic plan for land development and city planning), five new cities were built in the 1960s in the outskirts of Paris. Their development suggests the will to meet precise urban needs sometimes coupled with space availability, and services and equipment offers then thought of as innovative. Maurepas – until 1984 part of the new built-up area of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - was shaped in part by these aspirations. Today, its population is ageing and its urban layout reflects power struggles and is characterized by partitioning and relative uniformity. The city’s design hints at a will to build “a new style of urban life” (Gladieu, 2003). During this evolution, trailblazing middle-class households settled the area and took centre stage. They were driven by a belief in a new city where everything was to be built and that offered new perspectives in terms of personal space. They are now over sixty. Forty years after they settled in, their discourse on the city shows several sources of tension: on the one hand, tensions between rural and urban areas, and on the other, tensions between adherence, differentiation and reflexivity. These tensions can be paralleled with the city’s evolution and the way public debates on urban forms are being framed. These different elements lead us to consider the existing resistances and projections as well as the subjectivization processes they sometimes reveal.";"Rémi Tréhin-Lalanne

We develop the model on the basis of the Solow-Uzawa growth model, the neoclassical neoclassical growth theory with externalities, and ideas from tourism economics. The economy consists of three – service, industrial, and public - sectors. The production side is based on the traditional growth theories, while the household behavior is described by an alternative utility function proposed by Zhang. We introduce endogenous land distribution between housing and supply of services. The industrial and service sectors are perfectly competitive subject to the government’s taxation. The public sector is financially supported by the government. We introduce taxes not only on producers, but also on consumers’ incomes from wage, land, and interest of wealth, consumption of goods and services, and housing. We simulate the motion of the national economy and show the existence of a unique stable equilibrium. We carry out comparative dynamic analysis with regard to the rate of interest in the global market, the total productivity of the service sector, tax rate on the service sector, tax rate on consumption of services, human capital, the propensity to consume services, and the impact of public services on the productivity of the industrial sector. The comparative dynamic analysis provides some important insights into the complexity of open economies with endogenous wealth, public goods, and externalities.

During the land reform in Ukraine to land management encountered new challenges that focus on the implementation of land policy and land relations fundamental change. Accordingly, to land management faces new challenges.

Today for events to decentralize power facilities, new land - the territory united local communities should determine for whom the prospect of organizing the use and protection of land and other natural resources. However, the current land law the answer to this problem does not. Instead, normalization is an attempt to issues related to improving the quality of drafting documentation spatial planning (urban planning documents) establish procedures for integrated development plans of local communities, the introduction of rules regulating local area to establish procedures for planning, construction and other use areas and about objects, improving public hearings to address public interests and relieve tension in the planning and construction of the territories.

However, planning documentation does not solve the problems of perspective development of the organization use and protection of land and other natural resources. There is a need to distinguish between objects of regional urban planning and land management. This is because the urban planning regulations covering mainly two categories of land (settlements, industry, transport, communications and other purposes), not including agricultural land, which houses objects of capital construction. However, they make up for Ukraine just 4.2% of the total area. For the remaining seven categories of land (agricultural land, forest and water resources, conservation, recreation, recreational purposes) land use planning and their protection should be based on land documents.

For a reasonable solution for the sustainable development of land use in rural areas must both technologically interconnected circuits develop spatial planning, land management schemes and schemes establishing an ecological network within the area councils.

In this regard, we propose to change the ideology (concept), spatial planning for land development, directing it to priority land use tasks as part of the documentation for land management on the territory of the councils, including the consolidated territorial communities, which needs to assess the land resource and other natural resource potential of the territory, to reconcile and harmonize territorial and land-property interests of the state and territorial communities, citizens and businesses, to give proposals for improving local systems and land use patterns; to establish a balanced use of the properties of the earth as a natural object, natural resource and real estate.";"N.

La crisi climatico-ecologica a livello planetario ha portato alla consapevolezza di dover utilizzare indicatori diversi, in grado di valutare la qualità di un immobile anche in rapporto al suo potenziale impatto sull’ambiente.
La normativa tecnica sulla valutazione della sostenibilità ambientale degli edifici sviluppata dai primi anni di questo secolo, a livello sia nazionale, sia internazionale, considera l’impatto dell’edificio e la sua pertinenza, in relazione al ciclo di vita dei materiali e degli elementi che lo compongono, per i tre ambiti della sostenibilità: ambientale, economica e sociale. Appartengono a quest’ultimo, alcuni indicatori del benessere e della salute degli utenti, che interagiscono con le caratteristiche morfologiche e localizzative dell’edificio. Gli strumenti metodologici per la valutazione di tali indicatori sono, tuttavia, carenti e, comunque, di tipo prevalentemente qualitativo. Il presente articolo propone un approccio metodologico per la valutazione quantitativa degli indicatori di sostenibilità, basato sull’accessibilità dell’immobile alle risorse climatiche di un sito, come criterio di valutazione della potenzialità di riduzione dell’impatto negativo sull’ambiente, ma anche di miglioramento della qualità di vita degli utenti.";"Mario Grosso

Por el contrario, el análisis empírico demuestra que factores como la forma urbana son respuestas del libre juego de fuerzas económicas y sociales modeladoras del espacio. En consecuencia, lo que domina es un patrón de urbanización en vez de un proyecto de urbanismo; las cuales son modalidades muy distintas de hacer ciudad.Este articulo pretende demostrar que la forma urbana, derivada de la aplicación del instrumento normativo en una comuna perimetral metropolitana como es Maipú, es uno de los impactos no previstos por el Plan Regulador, pero que podría incorporarse en un nuevo instrumento de planificación urbana./ Metropolitan Santiago is one of the many Latin American cities which has been developed according to a spread model of urbanisation. This pattern has caused at least two types of consequences: economic and physical ones. The former is shown in the speculation of land value at the rural fringe of the metropolitan area which has low prices, these have suddenly increased after the normative changes in the land use, from rural to urban. The later shows location of massive low-income housing and commercial malls regardless connection to the urban fabric and spatial shaping of the existing city. This results in a chaotic urban form resembling a ""patchwork"".This paper reviews the scope of a Chilean policy instrument called ""Plan Regulador"" used to control physical urban growth, particularly sprawled on the fringe of the city. It is believed that as a consequence of this Plan, normative procedures are not good enough for achieving its objectives. Conversely, urban form appears to be a result of a profitability plan made by private developers.

In particular, zemleohoronni measures in the developed world are implemented through rural development policy, based on the conduct of the common agricultural policy, the creation of funds to support farmers, provide technical assistance, development of national programs and future development plans. For the European Union development policy documents on the development of land areas for 5-10 years - the overall trend. Land management activities are conducted in foreign countries on the basis of approved design documentation for land management different direction.

Found that the use of land and resource potential in the world is subject to the requirements of environmental safety. Agrarian relations in these countries are based on incentive levers, with direct execution of the rules of use and protection of land. By 2020, the strategy of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union provides funding for joint agricultural market, direct subsidies to farmers and stimulate agricultural development. Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union for its activities fully demonstrates the ability of European economies to maintain the same level of development.

State administration of environmental impact on the economic interests of the tenure or land use in countries with market economies include: tax exemptions (to make environmentally oriented activities), soft loans (available on interest rates for environmental investments), subsidies (for the implementation of environmental programs ) and subsidies (for growing products without pesticides) entities.

It is proved that the system of economic instruments in environmental policy Ukraine needs to improve, because it is poorly developed. Experience in other countries shows that as we strengthen land management tools (instruments for land administration), and its supporting tools to succeed in the system of rational land use. By tools include: a) political system; b) planning of land use; c) the economic and legal methods of state regulation of land relations and land market; d) guarantee of land ownership, land ownership and land use, taxation of land. By supporting tools include: a) the registration of rights to land, b) land cadastre) the arrangements for evaluation, accounting and inventory of land use and others.

For the improvement of the economic levers offer: 1) to work out mechanisms refund agrarian agricultural land ownership and land use using innovative technologies for the conservation and protection of soil; 2) simplify the subsidies, grants, benefits for land users at the expense of local budgets (from the land tax and compensation of losses of agricultural and forestry production); 3) Improve mechanisms to stimulate rational land use.

In addition, it is believed that it should be the private owners of the major organizations that implement environmental policy for the protection of land and carrying out effective environmental management due to their ownership or land use. Therefore, at the state level need to develop a program to encourage private sector agricultural producers.";"l.

This study addresses the question of food security, a step that is in contrast with agricultural planning considerations of the past that have mainly focused on maximizing profits or relied on a closed mathematical model. Two teams of experts identified production limitations affecting long-term planning and the ability to ensure food security under these conditions. It was found that there are five key factors important for the decision process: population, land, water, technology and international trade. The data show that today Israel imports a very large scale of virtual land and virtual water in terms of agricultural products.

A first benchmark is EU accession, but it does not apply to non accession transitional economies. Moreover, a delay is going to appear between accession and the full benefit of common policies – a second transition period will open in May 2004. Convergence criteria are likely to postpone the end of transition for decades, if not for ever. Institution building varies significantly among transition countries, but the non accession countries are trapped for a long time in a no man’s land between the former system and a market economy with its necessary institutions. Our privileged analysis is that transition ends when the economic phenomena that are specific to transition will vanish (and the associated concepts will  disappear). These are assumed to be transformational recession, transitional unemployment, barterisation, the typical informal sector and managerial entrenchment. They are not going to fade away without a second stage of transition.

Ukrainian spatial planning system is divided into urban planning and land management planning.According to the Law of Ukraine ""On regulation of urban development"" urban planning documentation is developed for: the entire territory of Ukraine, the region (a part of Ukraine’s territory) and as well for settlements and their parts.According to the Law of Ukraine ""On Land Management"" most land management documents are developed on the local level.Only two types of land management documentation are developedon the regional level, namely: a) land management schemes and feasibility studies of land use and land protection of administrative units; b) land management projects for the establishment (changing) of the boundaries of administrative units. Such projects as land management projects on ordering the territory for urban needs and land management projects on ordering the residential areas are developed on the local level.Other land management documentation is developed for a particular land parcel (setting boundaries, separation, change of purpose and so on.), or has a narrow specialization (area organization of agricultural land parcels, or providing the environmental and economic assessment of crop rotation). It’s found that almost all planning tolls belong to urban planning.

Austrian spatial planning has three levels with clear division of competences in all areas. Planning occurs at the level of the federal government, the federal land and the community. Also nominal spatial planning and professional planning in various fields, which has a significant impact on the environment is defined. Analysis of planning competencies at various levels shows that the lower the level of planning, the higher competence in nominal spatial planning and the lower in professional planning.

At first a concept of local development which contains the ideas and goals of development without a clear spatial reference (so-called vision of future) is developed. Based on this concept a plan for targeted purposes is developed.It clearly defines the boundaries of land parcelswith appropriate purpose. The next step is to make a plan of development for areas that are designated for residential, public or industrial building.This plan put restrictions and requirements for newbuildings,namely for their superficiality, compactness, density and possible use. Like the planning hierarchy, there is also a hierarchy of planning and cartographic materials of all planning levels.

During the process of comparing the approaches to spatial planning in Austria and spatial planning in Ukraine was found that the spatial planning system of Ukraine requires conceptual changes.

Therefore, it is proposed to upgrade the system of spatial planning to a hierarchical system, to refuse from separation of urbanplanning and spatial planning and land management and to update the tolls of this process at the local level (at the level of local communities).

It is proposed instead of the Master Plan of settlement, which in the present conditions of land relations reforming is not able to ensure the effective planning processes to implement a plan for target purposes and restrictions for the entire community and to develop on this basis detailed plans for areas designated for built up. This approach will provide a unified system of spatial planning for the successful development of both urban and rural communities.";"Dorosh A.M";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-08-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"UKR;AUT";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/7261/7038";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"7"

Standardization of transportation units allow to simplify transport logistics operations and enable the integration of different types of transport. Currently, container transport is the most popular means of transport by sea, but recent studies show an increase in its popularity in land transport. In the paper presented the concept of a&nbsp;comprehensive intermodal planning system in a distributed environment which enables more efficient use containers in the global transport. The aim of this paper was to formulate and develop new concept of Internet Intermodal Planning System in distribution environment, supporting the common interests of the consignors and the logistic service providers by integrating the transportation modes, routing, logistics operations and scheduling in order to create intermodal transport plans.

	Methods: In the paper presented and discussed the new approach to the management of logistics resources used in international intermodal transport. Detailed analysis of proposed classification of variety transportation means has been carried out along with their specific properties, which may affect the time and cost of transportation. Have been presented the modular web-based distribution planning system supporting container transportation planning. Conducted the analysis of the main planning process and curried out the discussion on the effectiveness of the new web-based container transport planning system.

	Result and conclusions: This paper presents a new concept of the distributed container transport planning system integrating the available on the market logistics service providers with freight exchange. Specific to container planning new transport categories has been identified which simplify and facilitate the management of intermodal planning process. The paper presents a modular structure of Integrated Internet Planning and Scheduling system that combines in one place freight exchange with logistics service providers along with all possible clients dispersed around the world. Comprehensive integration of many participants in the intermodal transport process creates new opportunities for access to distributed logistics services.

A direct relationship between the increase in the concentration of harmful substances in the atmospheric air of the contaminated area and the increase in the incidence of the population, including diseases of the respiratory system, circulatory systems, blood and blood-forming organs, endocrine, nervous systems is established.

Problems of ensuring environmental safety are traditionally among the priority areas of state-legal regulation. National environmental policy is aimed at achieving the strategic goals: preservation of natural objects and complexes, ecosystems, maintenance of their integrity and life support functions, sustainable development of society, improvement of the quality of environment and life, improvement of population health and demographic situation, provision of environmental safety state. And this is possible only in carrying out the assessment and consistent reduction of environmental risks for human health. There is a high risk of emergencies of natural and man-made nature in Ukraine. In Ukraine there are 23,767 potentially dangerous enterprises and other objects, the accidents on each of which can lead to emergencies of anthropogenic and natural state, regional, local and object level. Each year, up to 300 emergencies of natural and man-made nature are recorded, resulting in death of people, causing significant economic losses. Environmental policy in modern conditions is considered as an integrated factor of social and economic development of Ukraine, which helps to ensure the transition to sustainable development of the economy and the introduction of an environmentally balanced system of nature use.

Provision of environmentally and technogenically safe living conditions of citizens and society, preservation of the natural environment and rational use of natural resources is assigned by the Law of Ukraine ""On the Fundamentals of National Security of Ukraine"" to the priorities of the national interests of Ukraine (Article 6).

The environment is considered safe when its state meets the criteria, standards, limits and norms, established in the legislation, concerning its purity (non-contamination), resource intensity (non-extinction), environmental sustainability, sanitary requirements, species diversity, and ability to satisfy citizens' interests.

Today there is an increase in anthropogenic impact on the atmosphere, which is manifested mainly due to its pollution, and therefore inevitably affects the state of ecosystems and human health. That is why the study of problems associated with atmospheric air pollution - an extremely important natural component of human life and human life - is now becoming particularly acute and urgent. At present, the total air pollution in the large and medium-sized cities of Ukraine is 2-4 times higher than the permissible level and is dangerous for the health of the population. Consequently, the problems of ensuring environmental safety for the population of Kyiv, as many large cities of Ukraine, are very relevant.

"DOAJ:74e1d3efc3b04201ac24a4ea0337f939";"PECULIARITIES OF METHODOLOGICAL PROCESS OF FORMING RESTRICTIONS IN LAND USE";"";"In the practice of regulation of land relations certain requirements to formation of land use restrictions and encumbrances of land rights are formed. Their systematization process will improve the regulation of the legal regime of land use as legal provisions form the essence of the land use restrictions and encumbrances of land rights and should be considered in their formation.

As land use regime with restrictions in land use and other natural resources is interconnected, it is proposed restrictions to use spatial organization as a basic classification criteria. Spatial organization is formed by environmental management structure upon which different functional types and forms of land use, with the general trends in the exploitation of natural resources, land use and protection are integrated.

The article states that the restriction of land use are divided into physical and administrative. Physical limitations – a bottleneck that do not enhance the efficiency of land- and environmental management system. However, the administrative limitations are stereotypes and beliefs that cannot be questioned, combining 80 to 95% of all restrictions. It is noted that there are several types of limitations, which include: restrictions of the available potential, restrictions due to public interest, execution time limit and market limitations (balance between supply and demand).

Under the subtype of land use is meant the basic direction of use of land and other natural resources. Type of land use – a set of land use subtypes that have a similar intensity of use of land and other natural resources, improving the environment. It is therefore proposed to allocate two groups of natural resource use: a) resource-consuming (which modifies or destroys) and b) resource-saving (which saves) [2].

The first group includes the following land use types: background type, multicentral and central, and the second – disperse (saving). At the regional and territorial land use levels most clearly presented the background type of environmental management, which is interconnected with the zonal features of the landscape. For the background type of environmental management can be considered a priority of biological, land, water, and other resources. The background land use type is divided into subtypes: agricultural, forestry, traditional, resource, industrial and residential (rural).

To ensure systematic consideration of land interests of the state, local communities, citizens and businesses we selected three hierarchical levels of territorial organization of land use, which are characterized by their methodological approaches to the process of forming restrictions in land use. To go from the general (territory) to the specific (land) formation of land use regime institutional scheme of methodological process of restrictions forming in land use is proposed.";"Tretyak A.

The results show, at farm level, a trade-off between environmental and socio-economic sustainability in terms of altitude, of some productive potential of the land and in correspondence with an enlargement of the farm size. Moreover, the land factor plays a potential role also in terms of improvement of the global sustainability; a result this, that attributes great relevance to the land values. For this reason, the variables that explain the economic capacity of the farms assume strategic importance, given that the preservation of the quantity of land available for farming passes through the increase of the agricultural rent which, in turn, determines higher land values.";"Paolo Cupo

Thus far, this correlation has been under-researched at a national level in Greece. As a result, its effects on trip generation and passenger flows has been underestimated at the planning level, leading to the implementation of projects that are neither viable nor sustainable. This paper proposes that land use changes ought to be considered in tandem with transport-related changes at the planning stage. To this effect, we present a three-step methodology for an integrated approach to capturing future trip generation: the identification of future trip-generating poles within the study area; the development of scenarios related to the probability of these changes occurring and their potential magnitude; an estimation of future trends in passenger flows. The methodology is applied to the Metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, Greece. Using data obtained from development plans, national statistical services and research projects’ and studies’ findings, we estimate future trip-generation subsequent to land use change. Data is processed and evaluated by a local experts’ group, representing various key-disciplines of the area’s planning stakeholders.";"Iraklis Stamos

Found that rotation – a reasonable compromise between the main requirements of production, organization of territory and environment, placing crops in view of a favorable combination; compliance with acceptable saturation parameters optimally varying cultures, and thus the possible timing of a return to their previous cultivation while taking into account the duration of the accepted rotation.

Determined that the implementation and observance of crop rotation and better ensure the replenishment of nutrients of the soil, improving and maintaining its favorable physical properties, prevent the emergence of weeds, pests and pathogens cultivated crops and preventing the depletion of soil degradation processes and development.

Found that scientifically based crop rotation is the basis for the use of all complex farming practices, differentiated cultivation, rational use of fertilizers and caring for plants. Rotation is correct – it agroecosystem, which created the best conditions for growth and development of various crops, thus providing a growing high and stable yields, obtaining high quality products.

Soil and climatic conditions, specialty farms, crops structure and their biological characteristics defined as the type of crop rotation and crop rotation order. Each rotation should be selected such status, which would provide the greatest yield per unit area of rational use of all land. Therefore, proper placement crops in crop rotation must necessarily take into account the requirements of crops to their predecessor, thus it must evaluate not only the direct action of the first culture, but also take into account the impact of the latter on the following crops rotation.

On unproductive and degraded lands is recommended rotation of soil saturation with large crops of grasses and crops of solid cover, which makes it possible to avoid or minimize the growing row crops.

Introduce a rotation of soil combined with contour reclamation of the territory, which includes, band allocation of agricultural crops, construction of various water-regulating structures meadow to the degree of degradation of soil and the steepness of the slope. This limits the fields are projected across the slope or parallel horizontally, and to combat deflation - across the direction of prevailing winds.

The study crop rotation over time as a way of preventing the degradation of agricultural landscapes allowed to establish scientifically grounded crop rotation not only performs reclamation feature - provides protection from degradation of the soil and creates a favorable ecological environment in agricultural landscapes, but also can have significant economic efficiency. By comparison the actual amount of sales of crop considering the cost of its production in the administrative districts of Kyiv region (2703,4 million UAH) with a forecast value of crop production while maintaining a crop pattern in the rotation with a corresponding set of crops (3075,8 million UAH) proved that the economic effect of the introduction of scientifically grounded crop rotations in the region will be about 372,4 million USD, and additional income from 1 hectare of crop area – 322,8 USD.

It is proved that, in addition to rotation for a successful fight against land degradation on lands occupied in agriculture also need to implement complex soil conservation measures to protect soil from degradation. To determine the economically justified soil conservation measures were examined the economic impact and effectiveness of each in current market conditions.";"Shevchenko O.

The paper is an attempt at assessing the sustainability of ILGs in the country. The challenges facing the ILGs have heightened public fears that the land groups may not be sustainable. Based on the argument in previous studies that the ILGs are not sustainable, the paper used primary data from two separate questionnaire surveys of randomly selected ILG landowners (including legal settlers) and ILG stakeholders to investigate the problem. The combined sample size of 129 respondents (32.7%) was representative of the total ILG population, while a total of 25 indicators were used to test the respondents’ perceptions regarding ILG sustainability. Findings reveal that only one of the indicators received the positive support of the stakeholders, while no indicator was supported by the landowners. This suggests that the ILGs in PNG are not sustainable legal entities. This dilemma is a consequence of the challenges facing the ILGs, including the issues of corruption in the Lands Department, illiteracy among landowners, poor publicity given to ILGs’ functions, and the dysfunctional ILG legal framework.";"Lepani Karigawa

It shows that the atlas geoenvironmental mapping allows to perform high quality visualization of various spatial and temporal information in dynamic and static states, reflects the geoenvironmental state of objects that vary by rank, trends in its changes, and evaluates the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on it.

         Solution to this problem is possible with the correct choice of cartographic service, which can serve as the basis for creating a wide range of interactive digital atlases. Using the ArcGIS Online service allows you to use a larger range of cartographic imagery, which attracts users. At the same time, there are few examples of the creation of atlases of geoenvironmental issues both in paper and in digital form, so the article discusses actual problems in this area.

The views of various scientists on the nature of geoenvironmental atlas are characterized. It is shown that atlases of geoenvironmental content should have in their structure basic maps of such subjects: physical geography (hypsometric, geological, tectonic, hydrogeological, geomorphological, soil, hydrological, meteorological, biogeographical, etc.); Socio-economic (demographic, labor resource potential, health, industry, agrogeography, forestry, water management, mining, recreation and tourism, etc.); Ecological (ecology-geomorphological, ecology-geological, hydroecological, soil-ecological, bioecological, landscape-ecological, air pollution, medical-ecological, sanitary-epidemiological, etc.); Applied maps (recommendations aimed at solving geoenvironmental problems, optimizing the use of natural resources and improving living conditions of the population and biota).

Building environmental ratings have provided building owners with a credible and objective means to communicate to prospective tenants the environmental qualities of the building they are leasing and, by emphasizing more demanding performance goals and the benefits over typical practice, have begun to reframe expectations. Over the past twenty plus years, building environmental assessment has matured into a legitimate area of research and study. Assessment tools in use worldwide generally fall into two general categories:
1) Those developed by an organization within a country that maintains and manages it and provides the associated educational support and operational infrastructure. All the major recognized systems – BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE, Green Star in Australia, etc., – fall into this category.
2) Those developed by academics either for research purposes or in hopes that they could become a certification system but to date have yet to gain widespread adoption in their respective countries.";"Raymond J.

Human rights have social justice as an essential component and advancing both are considered core competencies in social work. International education in colleges and universities has gained in popularity as has service-learning. Research has been carried out in both these areas. However, less research has been done on the combination of the two. In this paper a course is described during which students spent three weeks in Costa Rica, the land of Pura Vida, learning about its human rights efforts, its language, getting to know its people, and providing service to some of its citizens. An analysis of student surveys and journals revealed a strengthened belief on the part of the participants that they are competent to have an impact on the world as well as having a responsibility to do so.";"Carolyn Bartick Ericson";"";"Indiana University School of Social Work";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2011-04-30";"en";"local community;rural population;urban population";"Urban Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"CRI";"Peer-reviewed publication";"https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/advancesinsocialwork/article/view/671";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/advancesinsocialwork/about/editorialPolicies#openAccessPolicy";"15"

Recently, the increased focus on the issue of land use has transformed the monitoring tools in the objectives of government land policies. This would have required a radical rethinking of the approach, as also is confirmed by the very disappointing results of the policies.
In this paper we propose to investigate the causes of the failure of the soil consumption policies of reduction, focusing mainly on two aspects: the analysis of the structural causes and the effectiveness of the knowledge and monitoring instruments.
In particular, for the latter issue, we explain, also with examples, the possible role of the cadastral and Real Estate Market Observatory databases to support the phase of knowledge in urban planning.";"Maurizio Festa

Per comprendere la dimensione di relazione del sistema Tor Vergata è fondamentale ricorrere all’applicazione del metodo rizomatico e virtuale della performative mapping. Un processo che implica l’attribuzione di un nuovo senso e un diverso ordine a ciò che è preesistente. In questo contesto solo la potenzialità del GIS può orientare nel de-codificare la configurazione territoriale di Tor Vergata che vede nel rizoma, nella molteplicità dei punti di vista e nella differenza, il principio fondamentale del suo agire. La lettura
rizomatica del GIS, infatti, conferisce un’immagine innovativa sostituendo all’idea di precarietà, l’idea di un tessuto non privo di forma, che connota Tor Vergata come “luogo”, non più come periferia.

A unique form of the gentrification process is examined using a case study of a small inner-city neighborhood on Koza Street through the monitoring of the area between 1998 and 2016, and giving voice to both the gentrifiers and gentrified. Almost ninety percent of the population in the area was displaced despite the inclusionary principles of an in situ Rehabilitation Project which has led to a large scale transformation of the physical space of
the street. The study includes four field studies conducted at different time intervals (1998, 2001, 2004, 2009) and a follow-up visit (2016) to the neighborhood, to critically assess the progression of gentrification in Turkey through its phases. Even though gentrification usually refers to the middle class invasion of urban land originally inhabited by the less privileged, our case reveals the effects of successive modes of a gentrification process which starts as an in situ rehabilitation project of a squatter prevention area initiated by a social democratic municipality with the “participation of local groups”, and turns into “gentrification by choice” in the successive years in the shadow of “Third Way” values. What is currently happening could be regarded as “gentrification by force” following urban renewal. In our case, however, the line between the two major components of gentrification, i.e., the “gentrifier” and the “gentrified”, seems to have become ambiguous, which calls for a further analysis of Turkey’s unique political and spatial dynamics.";"Reyhan Varlı Görk

The two projects strictly integrate the urban transformation projects in the implementation of the mobility system. The two societies that realize the project are Bagnolifutura SpA Urban Transformation Society, and Ansaldo STS SpA. The first has the task to act the executive urban plan of Bagnoli-Coroglio; the latter is one of the main company in the global railway &amp;amp; mass transit transportation systems and it is licenseed for design and construction of the line nr 6. The paper, in the whole complex process, wants to analyze particularly the long coordination process among the subjects responsible for the various design and construction phases and the equally hard work necessary for the granting of approvals. In other words, the paper wants to show that the expected and/or obtained results in terms of land-transport integration come not only from a rigorous design process, but mainly from a structured, long and often difficult activity of technical consensus building. For this result many meetings are necessary , field tests, surveys, expert analysis, but also the definite time for closing the significant phases of the procedure, avoiding the risk of indefinite times for discussion, never compatible with the timing of the funding. The definition of the trackwork, for example, is a synthesis moment of many requirements that must be met; their acceptance is never immediate, but it is verified only after a recursive process that assembles one after the other the pieces of a mosaic. It is a team effort involving multiple disciplines and a large number of professionals; they must work in close contact, making sure that the information&amp;rsquo;s flow in the right way, that the taken decisions are transparent, clear, and that are known to all; everyone must have the availability to revise some of the own work or, in extreme cases, to restart the process. A necessary first step of comparison has involved the layout of the railway line and the level of the track. During several meetings, audits, and technical evaluation stages, a series of design alternatives are studied, and are discarded all the hypotheses of trenches or close to the ground parts. The only possible choice was the creation of a tunnel starting from Campegna, that continues along the Sport Park, reaches Steel Mill, Science City and the Park Gate, serving the nodal points in the area. Among others, two engineering aspects are faced in the project&amp;rsquo;s development: the provision of electricity and water for the metro line, and the interference of the line with a large sewer pipe in the area. Another aspect is the integration between the architecture and the landscape as regards the stations and the gateways, with particular attention to the industrial archeology buildings.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Il contributo proposto, partendo dal Progetto Bagnoli e dall&amp;rsquo;ampliamento della linea 6 della Metropolitana verso Bagnoli, vuole analizzare un aspetto fortemente operativo di tali interventi. Si tratta, nel complesso, di progetti in cui la trasformazione urbana in atto &amp;egrave; fortemente integrata all&amp;rsquo;implementazione del sistema della mobilit&amp;agrave;. Due i soggetti attuatori, Bagnoli&lt;em&gt;futura&lt;/em&gt; SpA Societ&amp;agrave; di Trasformazione Urbana cui &amp;egrave; demandata l&amp;rsquo;attuazione del Piano Urbanistico Esecutivo di Bagnoli-Coroglio e Ansaldo STS SpA, azienda leader nel settore del Trasporto ferroviario e metropolitano e concessionario per la progettazione e realizzazione della linea 6.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Dell&amp;rsquo;intero processo si vuole fare particolare riferimento al lungo lavoro di coordinamento tra i soggetti preposti alle diverse fasi progettuali e realizzative e all&amp;rsquo;altrettanto lungo lavoro necessario per il&amp;nbsp; rilascio delle autorizzazioni di legge. In altre parole si vuole dimostrare come i risultati attesi e/o ottenuti anche in tema di integrazione trasporti-territorio derivano non solo da un rigoroso iter progettuale, ma soprattutto da una articolata, lunga e spesso difficile attivit&amp;agrave; di costruzione del consenso tecnico. Sono necessari pi&amp;ugrave; incontri, verifiche sul campo, rilievi, analisi specialistiche, ma anche di un tempo certo di chiusura di fasi significative del procedimento, scongiurando il rischio di un tempo infinito di discussione che non &amp;egrave; mai compatibile con i tempi del finanziamento. La definizione del tracciato, ad esempio, &amp;egrave; un momento di sintesi di molteplici istanze che devono essere accolte, che non trovano mai risoluzione immediata, ma solo dopo un iter ricorsivo che mette a posto prima i tasselli pi&amp;ugrave; grandi e via via quelli pi&amp;ugrave; piccoli del mosaico che si va a comporre. &amp;Egrave; un lavoro di squadra che coinvolge molteplici discipline e un gran numero di professionisti, che devono lavorare in stretto contatto, avendo cura che le informazioni circolino nella maniera corretta, che ci sia trasparenza e chiarezza nelle decisioni che man mano vengono adottate e che queste determinazioni siano note a tutti; tutti devono avere la disponibilit&amp;agrave; a rivedere parte del proprio lavoro o in casi estremi a ripartire daccapo. Una prima necessaria&amp;nbsp; fase di confronto ha riguardato il tracciato planimetrico e la quota del ferro. Nel corso di numerosi incontri, verifiche e fasi di valutazione tecnica, vengono studiate alternative di progetto, scartate tutte le ipotesi di tratti in trincea e a raso, scelta la sola realizzazione in galleria che partendo da Campegna prosegue lungo il Parco dello sport, raggiunge Acciaieria, Citt&amp;agrave; della Scienza e Porta del Parco servendo di fatto i punti nodali dell&amp;rsquo;area. Tra i tanti, due aspetti ingegneristici sono affrontati nel corso del progetto: la fornitura di energia elettrica e di acqua per la metropolitana, le interferenze del tracciato con grossi collettori fognari presenti nella zona. A raso, invece di rilievo l&amp;rsquo;integrazione architettonico-paesaggistica delle uscite e delle stazioni con particolare attenzione alle emergenze di archeologia industriale.&lt;/p&gt;";"Antonio Di Luccio

The digital revolution implies that the cost of making these data available for reuse is negligible, while it increases the opportunity cost of limiting their use to the purpose for which they were originally collected.
The law encourages such reuse, and there is a growing number of technical standards and good practices making that easier and sustainable. In short, nowadays, the publication of open data is a good practice, but also a duty for PAs.
The paper at hand discusses the aforementioned concepts, with the purpose of providing the elements needed to understand the state of the art of open data (as an approach to government, a field of research and a movement).

the technical point of view, the “linked data” formalism is discussed in some details.
The last part of the paper analyses the case of open data concerning government real estate in Italy.

The paper here proposed does not seek to analyse technical innovations of the sector, innovations allowed by new and increasingly efficient aircraft, by new sensors, by increasingly high performance software and more or less restrictive limitations imposed by the norms, all activities and regulations in rapid and, in some respects, tumultuous innovation and subject to other and more specific detail. 
The authors instead wish to propose a reflection on the actual possibilities, in the not too distant future, of the transposition of these technologies within the sphere of cadastral activities, so as to allow the economies and positive findings on photogrammetric measurement within the procedures of conservation of the Italian Cadastre.

By thus, they have developed a Messianic myth. The interpretation of Gush-Emmunim settlers’ experience of landscapes reveals a complex and contradictory structure of sense of space. Settlers’ mythical sense of space may be understood in two strata - imagined and material. The imagined stratum is conceived mainly in transcendental romantic terms while the material is reified according to classic conceptions. Two main contradictions are outstanding: first, between the romantic representation of Jewish landscapes and the classic representation of Palestinian landscapes in the imagined stratum; second, between the romantic representation of the Jewish home space in the imagined stratum and the classical representation of the suburban Jewish home landscape in the material stratum. The first contradiction is inherent in frontier societies as a means to pseudo-rationalize the colonisation of the land, although in general there may be a mixture of romantic and classic attitudes towards the natives. The settlers pioneering myth is highly subsidised by the government and aggressively backed by military force. This enables them to tolerate the surrounding fear, antagonism and hatred. Thus, the landscape they build represents power and domination with no regard to local nature and to the Palestinian landscapes that are perceived by the settlers as part of it. ";"Izhak SCHNELL

According to the Law of Ukraine ""On investment activity"" under the investment necessary to understand ""all types of property and intellectual values invested in business and other activities, which resulted in creating profit (income) or social effect is achieved.""

For the economy of any city, including the city. Kyiv and development of urban land use, renovation of industrial areas deindustrialization of inefficient production centers, it is extremely important investment activity (foreign investment) as one of the most effective mechanisms for the development and activities of national companies.

The purpose of the article to analyze the investment attractiveness of the redevelopment projects of industrial areas to economic development of eco-industrial land use in Kiev, despite the downward trend in investment activity of domestic enterprises, the need for technical and technological modernization of production as well as the entire market infrastructure, redevelopment of industrial areas.

Redevelopment areas – this is a comprehensive activity aimed at changing the existing construction work carried out with the help of large investments (investments) in reconstruction; renovation of; overhaul; demolition; conversion; improving the environment, which results in a positive effect on economic, social and environmental aspects.

Investment and construction projects related to redevelopment of industrial land use (objects) in the management of the city, characterized by considerable risks given the high capital intensity, binding to a specific area, and the impact of other internal and external factors. That is why this investment activity should be ensured exceptional dynamic management to ensure the quality of implementation and the necessary level of profitability and sustainability of urban areas. Thus, the development of industrial zones in the city through redevelopment can be valuable not only from the standpoint of economic development of the territory, but also provided the interconnected nature of urban problems, employment, population, environment and related changes in the social sphere and the administrative and legal system big cities.

In any case, the main, ultimately, the effectiveness of investments factor is the economic efficiency of the project of de-industrialization.

Today the economic evaluation of the effectiveness of investment and construction projects related to the redevelopment of industrial areas carried out in several ways, one of which involves the use of discounted costs of development project.

Summarizing the foregoing, we note that the key advantage of typical projects of redevelopment of industrial areas in Kiev are: the uniqueness of the territory (comparatively extensive area not far from downtown, provision of energy facilities, proximity to important waterway in Kyiv); active participation of local authorities (commitment to the development of transport and social infrastructure, landscaping); balance of residential areas and workplaces (project planning developed under ecological and economic aspects of the functional use of land).

However, the main disadvantages should include: significant capital investments, low returns such projects redevelopment of industrial areas (discount rate redevelopment project for the industrial area, according to our estimates of 41.9%).";"Yevsyukov T. O.

Such opposition and resistance can delay and limit the development of land in and immediately surrounding cities.

In addition to the fact that brownfield regeneration demands a variety of instruments, such as: tax subsidies, the change of land use ownership, soil remediation, planning regulative amendments, etc., the complexity of brownfield regeneration is primarily seen in a number of stakeholders participating in such a process. Thus, the paper focuses on the social aspect of brownfield regeneration - precisely, on researching the community role and reviewing the possibilities for achieving the 'local' interests in complex developmental processes. The main research hypothesis is that brownfield regeneration positively affects the creation of and strengthening the social cohesion in the areas close to the brownfield site. More precisley, the paper presents the ways towards strenghtening social cohesion in the initial phase of the brownfield regeneration process, as well as the effects of such a process in its operationalisation phase on social cohesion. The thesis is examined by two main parameters: 1) participation of local community, and 2) social costs and benefits of brownfield regeneration versus greenfield investment. The research results are presented in the form of argumentative essay. In fact, the critical overview of arguments for and against the main research hypothesis is provided based on the review of interdisciplinary literature in the domain of brownfield regeneration. Such research organisation ensures the identification and description of the measures needed for strengthening social cohesion, as an utmost goal of this research. The final research contribution is about offering the guidelines for similar methodological approach in urban research.";"Minić Marta

Afin d’impulser une nouvelle dynamique à ces territoires en crise, les pouvoirs publics ont fait le choix de politiques de régénération urbaine dans lesquelles la culture a eu progressivement un rôle de plus en plus déterminant. Cet article vise à comparer les deux conceptions des politiques de régénération culturelle, ainsi que leurs retombées territoriales. La première, impulsée par le gouvernement anglais, s’appuie pendant très longtemps sur une conception néolibérale de l’urbanisme, visant à recréer de l’activité économique à court terme, tout en minorant la dimension sociale. La seconde, prônée par le Land de Rhénanie du Nord-Westphalie, développe une approche plus écologique, culturelle et patrimoniale, tout en acceptant un impact économique différé. Ces perceptions différentes du développement économique auront des conséquences notables sur la régénération culturelle métropolitaine qui privilégie trois axes : l’émergence d’équipements culturels, le développement d’industries culturelles et la festivalisation de la culture. Dans les deux cas, même si les impacts territoriaux sont très variables, ils demeurent réels et touchent des domaines aussi divers que la revitalisation du tissu économique, l’amélioration de l’image de marque du territoire ou l’insertion sociale.<br>Two conurbations of the Great Manchester and the Ruhr (and more particularly the valley of Emscher) knew as from years 1960 of deep economic reorganizations related to the progressive stop of their traditional activities: textile industry and coal mining.

This article aims at comparing two examples of policies of urban regeneration and their territorial impact. The first impelled by the English government is based during very a long time on a liberal conception of town planning, aiming at recreating in the short term of the economic activity, while undervaluing social dimension. The second preached by the Land of the Rhineland of North-Westphalia develops a more ecological, cultural and patrimonial approach, while accepting a differed economic impact. These different perceptions of economic development have important consequences on the metropolitan cultural regeneration which privileged three axes: the opening of cultural equipments, the development of cultural industries and the “festivalisation” of the culture.

As a case study, we choose the Land of Călata (Hu. Kalotaszeg), a region from North-Western Transylvania, Romania, focusing on two of its best-known villages: Izvoru Crișului (Hu. Körösfő) and Sâncraiu (Hu. Kalotaszentkirály). Izvoru Crișului is appreciated for carpentry and handicrafts products, whilst Sâncraiu is well-known for its Hungarian folk music and dance festival. In order to illustrate how these activities can lead to economic development, we interviewed a craftsman family from Izvoru Crișului and a dance instructor, cofounder of the International folk music and dance camp that is held annually in Sâncraiu. We also analysed several handicrafts stalls from Izvoru Crișului to see exactly what kind of products were being sold in there. The results show that even though traditional crafts could generate an income for the local people, most of the products sold in Izvoru Crișului are not authentic, but brought there from other regions of Romania or abroad. On the other hand, the international folk music and dance camp from Sâncraiu is the best example of how a one-week event can help local economy by generating income for various stakeholders involved in the organisation and realisation of the event, and be the igniter of a larger agro-touristic activity. In the end, we concluded with several remarks concerning the need for raising awareness among the locals how to benefit from their cultural heritage and traditional occupations and we acknowledged the potential of traditional crafts and folklore as a means of diversifying income possibilities in rural areas.";"Roxana-Maria BUŞ

Proved that one way of solving this problem is the establishment of restoictions of land rights, restrictions in land use. However, the mechanism of regulation establishment, implementation and termination of restrictions on the rights to land are not very functional and needs improvement. Current legislation in Ukraine does not contain a balanced set of regulations that would determine the nature and objectives of the restrictions, including encumbrances of land rights, their types, the reasons establishing and implementing restrictions of ownership and other rights to land and so on.

Based on our analysis, we provide scientifically grounded suggestions on improving the legal framework, particularly, in terms of restrictions on land use and registration in the land management process, as an important means of influence on those rights in order to ensure rational land use and protection it is.

ecosystem services in different contexts ranging from natural to urban environments. Yet, where does the concept reach its limits?
This paper critically reflects the application of the ecosystem service concept in urban environments illustrating the handling of
urban structures (incl. built-up areas) and the risk that the normative principle of the concept could be missed. It is shown that in
theory urban structures refer to a variety of ecosystem concepts. As a starting point for ecosystem service assessments, these could
be classified into natural, managed, constructed and overbuilt systems. Since ecosystem service concepts do not directly refer to
a specific ecosystem definition, but to biophysical structures and processes, all of these classes could be included. However, the
dependency on context and scale makes a differentiation in practical ecosystem services assessment challenging. We conclude
that the ecosystem service concept does not reach its limits in urban environments, but urban environments represent an extreme
case characterized by multifunctionality and a high degree of modification that enables to uncover research challenges applying
in any environment. There is a need for a more transparent reporting of theoretical and methodological assumptions to facilitate
the comparability between ecosystem service assessments. Comprehensive approaches that consider multiple ecosystem services
and include human input, human modification, the ecosystem status as well as their interactions are required to understand the
spatial relations between ecosystem services delivered by different ecosystems.";"Simone A. Beichler

Data were drawn from the Taking Action Project: Using arts-based approaches to develop Aboriginal youth leadership in HIV prevention. ‘By youth, for youth’ HIV education and awareness workshops were facilitated in six Indigenous communities across Canada, incorporating traditional and contemporary art forms to explore how youth perceived the links between structural inequality and HIV vulnerability. Over 100 youth participated, with 70 partaking in individual interviews to reflect on their experiences at the workshops. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo software. Indigenous youth understood culture as a complex construct that included reconnecting to land, body, history, community and ceremony. For many youth, being Aboriginal and participating in cultural activities was seen as important for intergenerational healing, empowerment, health and combatting HIV. Youth spoke excitedly of their attempts to reclaim their languages and cultures despite barriers. They also understood art as a medium for self-expression and as an important site of cultural evolution.

Our project demonstrates that the incorporation of culture within health strategies is important for effective HIV prevention amongst Indigenous youth. Reclaiming Indigenous cultures, languages and ceremonies may help to nurture future generations, diminish cycles of victimisation and combat hopelessness by reconnecting youth to stories of resistance and survival.

Despite their complexity, the predictive power of these models remains relatively weak. This paper presents an example of an alternative modeling framework based on the concept of a Markov chain. The model assumes that land use at any given time, which is viewed as a discrete state, can be considered a function of only its previous state. The probability of transition between each pair of states is recorded as an element of a transition probability matrix.  Assuming that this matrix is stationary over time, it can be used to predict future land use distributions from current data. To illustrate this process, a Markov chain model is estimated for the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, USA (Twin Cities) metropolitan region.  Using a unique set of historical land use data covering several years between 1958 and 2005, the model is tested using historical data to predict recent conditions, and is then used to forecast the future distribution of land use decades into the future. We also use the cell-level data set to estimate the fraction of regional land use devoted to transportation facilities, including major highways, airports, and railways. The paper concludes with some comments on the strengths and weaknesses of Markov chains as a land use modeling framework, and suggests some possible extensions of the model.";"Michael Iacono

Understanding the subway system impacts on the type, combination, distribution and totally the development of basic activities in these centers, have an important role in managing development opportunities created along the Tehran subway lines. The multi criteria and fuzzy nature of evaluating the activity centers development make the issue as complex as cannot be addressed with conventional logical systems. One of the most important methods of multi criteria evaluation is Fuzzy Inference System. Fuzzy inference system is a popular computing framework based on the concepts of Fuzzy Sets Theory, which is capable of accommodating inherent uncertainty in multi-criteria evaluation process. This paper analyze shifts in activity centers along two lines of the Tehran subway system based on three major criteria by designing a comprehensive fuzzy inference system. The data for the present study were collected through documentary analysis, questionnaires and semi-structured interview. The result revealed that the level of the subway system influence on the pattern and process of the development of activities varied with the location, physical environment and entity of each station. Furthermore, empirical findings indicated that the subway line might weaken residential activities while attracting employment and service activities to the city center. Specifically, residential estates moved away from the city center to the suburbs whereas employment and service activities expanded from the existing central business district (CBD). The results can be applied to suggest planning policies aiming at improving the effects of public transit on property developemnet and land use change in a developing country.";"Ali Soltani

The environmental condition of land resources close to critical. Among the largest land area occupied by agricultural land (71% of which - 76% is arable land). Violation environmentally acceptable ratio of arable land, natural grasslands and forests negatively affected the sustainability of agricultural landscapes. Throughout the widespread land degradation processes, among which the most ambitious is the erosion (about 57.5% of the territory), pollution (20% of the territory), flooding (about 12% of the territory).

Sustainable (balanced) land is one of the key factors of sustainable nature of territorial entities and may be formed of a priority, taking into account environmental factors. In ecological optimization based on value criteria ekolohostabilizuyuchyh and anthropogenic pressures lands should necessarily provide for withdrawal of intensive land use, which in its modal properties can not ensure sustainability of land use. However, today in Ukraine within the territories of communities no project development to optimize land use on the basis of sustainable development.

Accordingly, the purpose of the article was the study of certain aspects of Land Management sustainable development of agricultural land within the territories of local communities.

The current structure of the land fund of Ukraine was actually formed in the Soviet period, under the influence of policies of extensive agricultural development. Violation environmentally acceptable ratio of arable land, natural grasslands and forests negatively affected the stability and condition of land, which is confirmed by relevant research. In such circumstances, balancing the land proposed to carry out in two stages - the ecological and economic. In ecological optimization criteria based on land value necessarily should include withdrawal from intensive land use, which in its modal properties can not ensure sustainability of land use.

In this respect, proposed to use as a criterion factor environmental sustainability of land use and anthropogenic load factor. Assessing the impact of land in the sustainability area council, which depends on the stability of agricultural development area, and tillage intensity of land, construction work is characterized by a coefficient of environmental sustainability of land use.

Proved that the crucial part of the ecological optimization of land use on the territory of local communities is a balanced structure of land on the basis of ecologically appropriate use. It is important that quality indicators improve the structure of agricultural land in the optimization occurs within the environmental feasibility, increases the stability of land use and contributes to sustainable and balanced agrolandscapes territory.

Soil deflation here is often in the spring, when arable land have the lowest level of vegetation protection.Drywall southeast winds dry up much upper layers of soil, destroy its structure and cause local deflation, particularly in the areas of drained peat and mineral soils of sandyand sandy-loamygranulometric composition.Display of local deflation on the same land for several years, leading to significant loss of soil.

The intensity of these hazards depends largely deflationary stability of the soil, of which the main criterion in the literature defined mechanical strength (cohesion) of soil aggregates and main indicator - content in soil aggregates with a diameter greater than 1 mm.

Based on experimental data obtained in the Kyiv Polissya proven ability to adjust the deflationarydurability of sod-podzolic sandy-loamy soils by rational combining fertilizer plants and chemical reclamation.Increasing the strength of the structure at the joint application of lime and fertilizers due, based on a close correlation, positive changes in soil absorbing complex caused by calcium of lime and humus content increase and improve its quality composition: accumulationof calcium humates that play a leading role in grouting units. In addition, liming of unsaturated bases soils prevents the destruction and removal of these most valuable in agriculturally parts thereof: silt fraction.When applying lime on organo-mineral background of relative content increased by 8,2-18,4%, and the application of some fertilizers - on the contrary, decreased by 10,2%. Liming of acid soils increases the ""grain rate structuring"" at 0,3-0,6% compared to organo-mineral background, while the separate application of fertilizers reduces it to 2,1-2,7%.

Comparison of granulometric and mikroagregative analysis by methodology of B.A.Nikitin shows that aggregation of large particles in the test soil occurs solely at the expense of sludge.In particular the use of mineral and organic fertilizer sludge fraction in the formation of a macrostructure does not participate (relative rate of participation of fines in the formation of macrostructure is 0). When combined fertilizer, the figure is 0,24-0,30 on unlimestoneareas and 0,30-0,48 on limestone plots.

The process of aggregation in sod-podzolic sandy-loamy soil uneven: more (65-100%) in the intermediate fractions (0,25-0,001 mm) than in coarse (1-0,25 mm). When combined lime and fertilizer alignment occurs of aggregation process.Application of CaCO3 at a dose of 1,5, calculated by hydrolytic acidity, together with organic-mineral system of crops fertilizer allows to 47,7% transfer this process in macroaggregates.

The interrelations between ecosystem services and socioeconomics have scarcely been considered in the context of urban-rural areas. We investigated the spatial gradients and the mutual linkages of several ecosystem services and
socioeconomic variables in the urban-rural areas of Leipzig, Germany, and Kunming, China. The results showed some regularities in the spatial patterns of ecosystem services and socioeconomic dimensions in both study areas. Habitat quality and f-evapotranspiration of Leipzig and habitat quality of Kunming
demonstrated apparent increasing trends along all gradient patterns. However, the other ecosystem
services presented divergent spatial variabilities in different gradient patterns. Road density, urban fabric
and population density showed identical declining trends in both case study areas. Differently, household size, housing area as well as unemployment rate in Leipzig presented inconsistent spatial dynamics with considerable fluctuations. With regard to the gradient interrelations, road density, urban fabric and
population density were strongly correlated with most ecosystem services in both case study areas. In contrast, the gradients of household size, housing area and unemployment rate of Leipzig showed inconsistent correlations with the ecosystem services gradients. Our study provides evidence to the argument that typical patterns of ecosystem service gradients do not exist in different urban-rural areas.";"Ying Hou

Consequently, the aggressive spread of invasive alien plants (IAPs) in the river catchments of South Africa is a major threat to, inter alia, water security. The Olifants River catchment is one such a catchment that is under pressure because of the high demand for water from mainly industrial sources and unsustainable land-use, which includes IAPs. This study considered the cost-effectiveness of clearing IAPs and compared these with the cost of a recently constructed dam. The methods used for data collection were semistructured interviews, site observation, desktop data analysis, and a literature review to assess the impact of IAPs on the catchment’s water supply. The outcomes of this study indicate that clearing invasive alien plants is a cost-effective intervention with a Unit Reference Value (URV) of R1.44/m3, which compares very favourably with that of the De Hoop dam, the URV for which is R2.93/m3. These results suggest that clearing invasive alien plants is a cost-effective way of catchment management, as the opportunity cost of not doing so (forfeiting water to the value of R2.93/m3) is higher than that of protecting the investment in the dam.";"Tshepo Morokong

"DOAJ:e61398d9db784385ad0f10ef27df8400";"Theoretical concepts ""land management process"", ""land management procedure"" and their relationships";"";"The state significance of land management activities is manifested in those legal consequences that arise after the issuance of land management documentation and are conditioned by the need to secure unsupported land rights and the use and protection of land in a state-guaranteed manner. The procedural activity of land surveyors and other persons authorized by the state to commit land management operations must be carried out in a certain order established by the state and obey the rights and obligations of the persons specified by the legislation at each stage of the development of such relations.The main goal of applying to land management organizations and land surveyors is landuse documentation, which is made in accordance with the requirements of the law and with which the relevant legal properties of the land management procedure are associated.

First of all, let's dwell on such basic concepts as ""land management process"" and ""land management procedure"". Consideration of the term ""land management process"" implies a preliminary analysis of the category ""process"". At the same time, it must be admitted that the development of the procedural form of this category has not been paid attention. Considering the concept of ""land management process"", its place and role in the system of social relations, emphasis will be placed on the concept of a broad understanding of the legal process, the problem of which exists for decades.Thus, the legal process is a regulated by the procedural rules procedure for the activities of competent state bodies, consisting of the preparation, adoption and documentary consolidation of legal decisions of a general and individual nature. In the land law, the category ""process"" is specific and serves to designate relationships that provide regulatory and security land-property relationships.

Particularly difficult today is the question of the delimitation of the concepts of ""process"" and ""procedure"" in general. Regarding the land management process, we believe that the land management process is an activity directly related to the need to use different methods and means of legal acts. Elements of the land management process are its subjects, stages and proceedings, which allow to outline the boundaries in space and time and the substantive composition of this form of activity. Many scholars regard the procedure as a broader concept that should absorb the process.The stability of any procedure, including land management, will depend on its perfection, which is determined by the duration of its application or the ""test of action"". Consequently, if the procedure is a static norm, and procedural activity is its dynamic criterion, then the latter must constantly check the land management procedure for its compliance with its needs of individuals and society.

Any procedure should have certain limits. Regarding land management procedures, it should provide legal certainty (veracity) to land-based operations. Consequently, its boundaries should be legislatively enshrined. The action and its regulation by law may differ, indicating the need to compare them as relatively independent legal categoriesin some cases. Thus, for land management science and practice, it is necessary to consolidate two relatively independent concepts of ""land management"" and ""land management procedure"", which will distinguish the actual behavior of subjects from the regulated by law.";"Tretiak A.M.

At the moment about 75 % of the Dutch coast is protected by sand dunes that vary its length from 100 meters to several kilometers, 15% of the coast is made up of man-made constructions ""hard"" structures such as dams, and artificial barriers, while 10% remaining is characterized by flat and very extensive beaches.</p><p>The relationship between land and sea in the Netherlands has always been characterized by a twofold consideration, the positive sea beach, home of leisure and recreation, fishing and yachting venue; but on the other hand, perhaps the most important, the the sea is seen as Gevaar, as danger and as such must be considered when planning the structure of a future city.</p><p>In this article, we wanted to investigate this planning approach investigating the coastal area of the city of The Hague, Scheveningen, which is for many centuries considered the most important beach in the country but that, in addition to being home to recreational activities, ricreative &amp; Wellness is constantly faced with the danger of flooding .

Il caso studio di Torre Annunziata nel golfo di Napoli";"";"Quest’articolo parte dallo studio delle città portuali storiche, siti UNESCO, che oggi affrontano la sfida della riqualificazione dei waterfront urbani attraverso la conservazione del patrimonio culturale e paesaggistico. Le raccomandazioni sull’ “Historic Urban Landscape”, e gli strumenti operativi promossi dall’ICOMOS “Guidance on Heritage Impact Assessments for Cultural World Heritage Properties” del 2011, si configurano come le più recenti disposizioni concernenti la conservazione, protezione e valorizzazione del patrimonio culturale (Fusco Girard, 2010). La Guida ICOMOS è stata considerata lo strumento più adatto per valutare gli impatti dei grandi progetti di riqualificazione dei waterfront urbani sul patrimonio culturale. Per comprendere al meglio tale strumento è stata fatta un’applicazione per valutare gli impatti del Grande Progetto Pompei sul waterfront di Torre Annunziata, città costiera nel Golfo di Napoli sito UNESCO. A questa fase di analisi segue una riflessione su come migliorare l’Heritage Impact Assessment, come strumento capace di valutare non soltanto gli impatti culturali ma anche quelli economici, per parlare di “economia del patrimonio culturale”. La proposta ultima è quella di affiancare al processo di “Heritage Impact Assessment” una valutazione degli impatti economici, attraverso un’analisi costi-benefici, per quantificare in termini monetari la convenienza degli investimenti nella conservazione del patrimonio storico urbano delle città costiere, proponendo una “Economic Heritage Impact Assessment” (EHIA). Tale metodo, elaborato dall’autrice all’interno della tesi di dottorato “Il paesaggio storico urbano delle città costiere: sfide e opportunità. Il caso Torre Annunziata”, offre la possibilità di superare la sola valutazione degli impatti culturali proposta dall’ICOMOS.";"Mariarosaria Angrisano";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2015-12-31";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_2_15_5i";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"23"

Il progetto “Equità, catasto e governo del territorio” affronta il nodo della fiscalità immobiliare e, in particolare, di come l’equità possa essere garantita in Italia soltanto attraverso un processo di revisione degli estimi catastali. Nel nostro Paese, infatti, i valori catastali si presentano completamente sconnessi dai valori di mercato reali dei beni e, quindi, dalle loro caratteristiche e qualità.
Il progetto ha l’obiettivo di definire le linee metodologiche per la revisione dei valori catastali dell’intero patrimonio nazionale, che rispondano a requisiti di scientificità e che siano nel contempo applicabili. 
Considera il momento della stima dei valori come uno specifico passo di una metodologia di più ampio respiro, che comprende anche il nodo delle infrastrutture tecnologiche e delle banche dati. Concepisce infatti il catasto, con le sue banche dati, come il cuore di Lis (Land Information System) e considera il processo di revisione degli estimi anche nella prospettiva di mettere le premesse per un’imposizione immobiliare più moderna, capace di riconoscere e circoscrivere territorialmente le dinamiche dei valori e, in particolare, quelle che si manifestano sotto forma di esternalità pecuniarie prodotte da interventi pubblici, siano essi grandi progetti e/o infrastrutture.";"Rocco Curto

we propose using an additional terminology to bring clarification into the controversial discussion about i) 
ecosystems versus agrosystems and ii) ecosystem services versus agrosystem services. A literature review 
revealed that with the exception of some very recent publications, this has not yet been sufficiently 
reflected, neither within the scientific nor in the policy discussion. The question remains whether to spoil 
the discussion with new terms again and again. We reason that it makes sense to underpin the case-specific 
share of agricultural inputs to the supply of agroecosystem services and to add “agro” to the terminology. We 
conclude, that there is a need to promote the new terminology of agrosystem services and to strengthen the 
use of the already established term agroecosystem services within this context.
To emphasise the production patterns behind the multiple benefits agricultural systems provide to humans 
(commodity and non-commodity outputs) and to guarantee a reasonable weighting of related externalities 
in policy processes, we suggest to introduce the term agrosystem services into the discussion on ecosystem 
services. Agrosystem services in this context describe the anthropogenic share of agroecosystem services’ 
generation. Agroecosystem services include multiple provisioning, regulating and cultural services from 
agricultural ecosystems. The inclusion of agrosystem services might accommodate the ecology-based 
ecosystem services concept to the specificity of managed agricultural ecosystems and therefore could be 
better implemented by mostly economy-driven agricultural production systems and agricultural policy.";"Hubert Wiggering

Nella parte introduttiva discutiamo la rilevanza del concetto di camminabilità per la qualità urbana ed offriamo un suo inquadramento teorico all’interno dell’approccio alle capacità (capability approach). La parte centrale è dedicata alla presentazione del modello spaziale e multicriteriale di valutazione della camminabilità. La nostra costruzione della camminabilità nel modello propone un certo ribaltamento di prospettiva rispetto ai metodi sinora proposti: anziché valutare quanto un determinato luogo è in sé camminabile, il punteggio di camminabilità calcolato riflette come e verso dove una persona può intraprendere una camminata a partire da quel luogo; in altre parole, non quanto è camminabile, ma invece qual è la camminabilità di cui il luogo è dotato. Per questo, il punteggio di camminabilità combina tre componenti: (1) il numero di destinazioni di interesse/opportunità urbane raggiungibili a piedi; (2) le loro distanze; (3) la qualità dei percorsi pedonali verso queste destinazioni. La qualità dei percorsi pedonali è valutata in base a diversi attributi rilevanti per la camminabilità, che fanno riferimento a caratteristiche proprie della strada e dell’ambiente circostante in grado di contribuire a rendere il percorso piacevole, sicuro ed attrattivo. A titolo illustrativo viene nella terza parte dell’articolo presentato un esempio di applicazione del modello alla città di Alghero.";"Ivan Blečić

La realizzazione dei “presupposti tecnici” di cui si parla, grazie agli sviluppi straordinari delle tecnologie informatiche, rappresenta il traguardo meno difficile da raggiungere, mentre è di gran lunga più complicato risolvere le difficoltà giuridiche derivanti dalla storica diversità dei Registri, tenendo anche in considerazione il limite posto dall’art. 345 del Trattato sul Funzionamento dell’Unione Europea, secondo il quale “I trattati lasciano del tutto impregiudicato il regime di proprietà esistente negli Stati membri”.

According to our long-term field, cartographic, laboratory and remote sensing research, division of riverbed into homogeneous geoecological segments was made, as well as their standardization in accordance to the trends of unfavorable processes. Main reasons for deterioration of quality characteristics of channel-floodplain river complex were outlined; the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in deterioration of geoecological condition of the river and its floodplain complex was analyzed.
Based on the assessment results it is possible to state that the condition of study segments of the Berezhnytsya river flood-plain and stream-way complex was marked as “excellent”, “good” and “satisfactory”. “Unsatisfactory” and “catastrophic” river and flood-plain condition has not been detected yet, although within Dashava urban settlement the river area condition is close to the “satisfactory” grade. The best situation is at the river head as human impact is minimized here and natural vegetation is preserved. Downstream we trace the tendency of condition worsening as anthropogenic load on the basin system and flood-plain and stream-way complex increases. Its negative impact is balanced by large forests, thus in segments limited by Banya Lysovytska village and Lotatnyky village the river and flood-plain condition is rated as “good”. So, downstream from the named village the value of such an important natural barrier as forest is reducing and anthropogenic load on the river significantly increases. The latter manifests in an intensive agricultural reclamation and housing development of flood-plains.

Since degradation processes are rapidly developing over a considerable part of the Berezhnytsya river, negative changes are visible and only the study area, located close to the river head, is in almost optimal condition, a set of urgent measures to stop destructive for the river and its ecosystem processes, to rehabilitate the river and to preserve its resources should be made. Primary measures to improve the river condition should be: to clean off the stream-way and bank-line protective zone from domestic garbage and natural waste; to comply with behaviour requirements in respect of the bank-line protective zone and setting its limits; to fix eroded banks; to limit alluvium extracting from the bed and banks; to organize watering sites for animals; to provide better treatment of wastewater at municipal wastewater treatment plants located in Morshyn city and Dashava village, industrial effluents of Dashava production office of underground gas storage, Dashava composites plant, and Dashava construction materials plant management through their renovation; to reduce possibilities of getting water contaminated with the toxic waste from toxic waste landfill “Shkiryanyk”, into the river and to ensure the oil pipelines crosses the stream-way under the due protection. It is also important to reduce the regulation of a runoff because ponds are mainly lifeless and used for purposes other than intended ones. It is necessary to reduce the intensity of agricultural activity over the flood-plain lands.";" Kovalchuk I.

Tale prospettiva è declinata nel progetto pilota MiraMap, a Torino, nella Circoscrizione Mirafiori Sud, di cui è responsabile un gruppo di ricerca del Politecnico di Torino. Il progetto implementa e sviluppa una precedente esperienza effettuata nel 2013 (Crowdmapping MirafioriSud), il cui scopo principale era quello
di verificare se l'uso delle ICT potesse generare e supportare processi di inclusione sociale. Attraverso la lettura del processo MiraMap, degli obiettivi, della metodologia adottata, delle fasi e delle linee di azione vengono evidenziati ragionamenti di natura interdisciplinare e tecnica relativi a: la strutturazione dei rapporti con le Istituzioni, in particolare la Pubblica Amministrazione, nei processi di pianificazione e gestione dello spazio pubblico; l’innesco di processi di inclusione, partecipazione e di civic
engagement; l’identificazione degli apporti che tali sperimentazioni possono generare nella costruzione di una rinnovata governance urbana. Il presente contributo delinea infine una possibile metodologia per il monitoraggio e la valutazione di impatto ex post, basata sulla Community Impact Analysis/Evaluation
(CIA/CIE), che valuta in modo descrittivo gli impatti – pecuniari e non – originati dal progetto, in rapporto ai diversi soggetti coinvolti.
L’impiego delle ICT può favorire processi di trasparenza e rafforzare l’accountability della PA, a condizione che la tecnologia sia fattore abilitante e non di esclusione. L’analisi puntuale del caso fornisce spunti di riflessione in merito a tale approccio innovativo: la relazione cittadino/PA può contribuire nel medio-lungo termine a veicolare impatti socio-economici positivi sul territorio, rendere il cittadino più informato e coinvolto e l’Amministrazione più responsabile, consapevole dei bisogni “dal basso” e capace di facilitare e attivare processi inclusivi e di microprogettualità sul territorio.";"Cristina Coscia

Part and parcel of this approach was the government’s control of development land and its value. Beginning in the 1970s, as the precepts of an all-knowing, interventionist state clashed with the reality of uncontrollable global forces driven by multinationals and international finance, it became clear that planning had become a market-driven process, a “servant of the market”, and that inflexible, detailed plans would not work in most real-life situations. Consequently, such plans were either ignored or overridden. This crisis of planning spurred a search for alternatives based on public-private partnerships, negotiation, and flexibility including ways to transfer increased land values to the public trough the development process. This approach is generally known as Land Value Recapture (LVR). This paper presents an example of LVR in the US, a rather unique example in the US. It concludes by suggesting that the belief that the increase in land values is not the result of the landowner’s activities, and are therefore “unearned” and should be recaptured for the public benefit, is not part of the American planning culture. LVR, then, might have a hard time supplanting other market-based regulatory strategies that are voluntary for developers and less restrictive of property rights for the landowner.";"Nico Calavita";"";""Mediterranea" University of Reggio Calabria";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-12-31";"it";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"150;021";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.19254/LaborEst.09.11";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://pkp.unirc.it/ojs/index.php/LaborEst/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"6"

Ukrainian spatial planning system is divided into urban planning and land management planning.Urban development field belongs lion's share of planning tools, while in Ukraine is only about 4% of the land is built-up. Comprehensive conceptual spatial planning is inherently absent in Ukraine. Only single brancheshave tools for conceptual planning on the nationallevel, and therefore planning effectiveness is negligible.

The existing system in Ukraine is in its essence the legacy of Soviet planning system, the aim of which was to establish production processes and the use of everything that can be used for economic purposes. Also, it can’t effectively respond to modern trends in social and economic spheres.

The lack of conceptual planning system also leads to inconsistent planning actions between different sectors, making it impossible to fully realize the ideas of actors from different spheres. Another obstacle is the lack of real long-term impact tools (approved at the state level planning and forecasting documents). So on a practical level, most of the decisions are more situational and not promising.

Austria’ssystem of spatial planninghas tools which provide conceptual planning at the federal level. Every decade Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (ÖROK)is convened. The conference develops and approvesAustrian Spatial Development Concept for 10 years (ÖREK).This concept is not a directly applicable law and does not require its implementation, but its implementation is achieved by the fact that it’s developed in cooperation of the entire country and everyone feels responsibility for compliance and implementation of these ideas.

By comparing approaches to spatial planning in Austria and spatial planning in Ukraine, it’s found that the planning system of Ukraine requires conceptual changes.

It is important to create a collective body under the Cabinet of Ministers, which would develop the concept of spatial development of Ukraine. The Law of Ukraine ""On the general scheme of planning the territory of Ukraine"" should be amended to make this toolnot narrow specialized but general, comprehensive and the one which put a human in its centre.

It is also necessary to amend the Law of Ukraine ""On Land Management"" and ""On regulation of urban development"" to systematize planning tools.

In Italy, the development of urban and other artificial land has been irreversibly transforming a non-renewable resource such as soil, regardless the almost constant population rate, with different speed depending of the region considered.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the phenomenon in the metropolitan area of Naples, which is an area highly affected by territorial aggression of human matrix. The data used are both by the Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) Report 2015 on the usage of the land and by ISTAT relating to the resident population up to the 1st of January 2015 and the extension of land for agricultural use (Census 2010). The mathematical combination of this data creates a new indicator that can be referred to as “residual land”; this residual area is of great extension with many different characteristics and it could represent the area where the phenomenon of land take most occurs.

The identification, measurement and analysis of “residual land” provide new insights on the evolution of land take and this new indicator can represent a critical element to work on to prevent future land transformation and protect natural and agricultural areas within the Italian context.";"Giuseppe Mazzeo

Natural capital, often defined as the stock of natural ecosystems that yields a flow of valuable ecosystem goods or services into the future, is often undervalued or not valued at all by governments, business and society, which leads to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. One of the major reasons of such undervaluation is the lack of practical, realistic quantitative methods/models that would establish ecosystem services value and its change due to human development. A promising, recently developed ecosystem services modeling system is InVEST: “Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs.” InVEST is a set of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) models that predict the provision and value of ecosystem services and habitat provision given land use/land cover maps and related biophysical, economic, and institutional data for the study region. InVEST, if further developed and applied in a systematic way, could facilitate mainstreaming the natural capital into decisions at all levels and provide a strong foundation for local natural resources managers to improve and optimize their environmental management strategies.";"Arnas Palaima

social and economic unsustainability. The rapidly growing unsustainable, fossil energy powered urbanindustrial
technosphere and their detrimental impacts on nature and human well-being are threatening the solar
energy powered natural and seminatural biosphere landscapes and their vital ecosystem services. A sustainability
revolution is therefore urgently needed, requiring a shift from the „fossil age“ to the „solar age“ of a new world
economy, coupled with more sustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns. The sustainable future of viable
multifunctional biosphere landscapes of the Mediterranean Region and elsewhere and their biological and cultural
richness can only be ensured by a post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society. For this purpose a
mindset shift of scientists and professionals from narrow disciplinarity to transdisciplinarity is necessary, dealing
with holistic land use planning and management, in close cooperation with land users and stakeholders. To conserve
and restore the rapidly vanishing and degrading Mediterranean uplands and highest biological ecological and
cultural landscape ecodiversity, their dynamic homeorhetic flow equilibrium, has to be maintained by continuing
or simulating all anthropogenic processes of grazing, browsing by wild and domesticated ungulates. Catastrophic
wildfires can be prevented only by active fire and fuel management, converting highly inflammable pine forests
and dense shrub thickets into floristically enriched, multi- layered open woodlands and recreation forests.

For its close relation with social habits and people behaviors, in fact, innovation in transports play a strategic role both in the decreasing of the environmental impact of mobility and in the improvement of the quality of the built environment. To do so, however, cities need to reach a more effective integration between transport policy and land-use planning, as well as taking full advantage by the spreading of new technologies. In this context, this paper discusses the challenges provided by the reshaping of the transport system in the metropolitan area of Palermo, the second larger city in Southern Italy. It attempts to explore, particularly, the potential connections between the future “hard factors” of the transport policy – as a result of the programme of infrastructural improvement under realization in the urban area –, with other “soft factors”, such as the practices of social innovation in the field of mobility with the help of ICTs and other opportunities for urban regeneration linked to the reshaping of the transport system.";"Ignazio Vinci

We use data on 26 OECD countries over the 1978-2006 period. We estimate the effect of patents endowments of countries on their investment specialization across sectors and show that knowledge enclosures involve self-reinforcing innovation patterns. Moreover, we perform a structural change analysis and find that the TRIPs agreement has significantly strengthened the relationship between countries' patents specialization and investment specialization. We conclude by suggesting that stronger international patent protection may restrict global investment opportunities, and this may be one of the factors contributing to the present crisis.";"Filippo Belloc

But at the same time the agricultural land market through the introduction of a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land had stopped functioning.

The lack of a common classification of property for agricultural purposes, a number of legal and legislative aspects are currently the main obstacles to the creation of a transparent market for agricultural real estate, which includes not only the land but also buildings and structures that are directly or not used in agriculture .

The main aim of the article is to highlight the constructive action to improve the functioning of the market for agricultural real estate, namely the possibility of creating an integrated classifier to agricultural real estate and amend the information files of the State Land Cadastre and State Register of rights to real estate. The successful operation of agricultural property market in Ukraine would be ruling out in the absence of a common classification of real estate for agricultural purposes, so this classification should be offered. At this stage, the existing categories of land use purpose designed classifier property for agricultural purposes is integrated with links to existing Classification and aims to unify all objects of agricultural purpose in a single classification.

Creation classification of objects of agricultural purpose, of course, accelerate the successful start functioning agricultural estate market, but it in no time, not provide it completely. And one of the main obstacles to implementing it is valid to do at this time in Ukraine a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land.

According to the authors, the lack of legitimate opportunities to operate in the market for agricultural real estate leads to illegal activities to the ground and holding back the development of the State Land Cadastre and slows conduct any research and development in the field of land evaluation.

The necessary preconditions for the introduction of the land market should be:

- Completion of the establishment of the land cadastre, which will set clear boundaries of land and their legal owners all over Ukraine;

- Develop a reasonable methodology for determining the minimum price of land because of its fertility, location and other characteristics of each region of Ukraine.

The article also proposed a few changes to the information file about the registered property rights to land and on registered land. In addition, these changes are based on the capabilities of monitoring land market and summarize data on the prices of land by Design State Committee for Land Resources of Ukraine on the land market monitoring and summarizing data on land prices.";"Martyn A.

The absence of an effective land cadastre system significantly complicates the state control over land use and protection, lack of conditions to stimulate soil protection activities on agricultural lands.  

In the conditions of the functioning of new forms of economic in agriculture, there is a significant deterioration of the ecological state of lands, Therefore it is necessary not only theoretical and methodical provision of measures for rational use of lands, but their effective and practical implementation in production.

The aim of the research were an analysis of the current state of the use of agricultural lands, and also finding waysщо    забезпечують охорону, which provide protection, conservation and restoration of soil fertility.

One of the most effective agrotechnical measures, which can be regulated processes of humus formation is is soil tillage.

-  Improving the principles of ecological and landscape landmanagement;

-  Improving the legal framework of protection of agricultural lands;

The satellite images can be used to determine areas of crops that are resource for nectar and pollen such as sunflower, buckwheat and corn. Identifying bee forages was based on methods of supervised classification such as minimum distance to means, the linear discriminant analysis, the maximum likelihood, the parallelepiped and the k-nearest neighbors.

The accuracy of classification methods of remote sensing data for identification of pollen and nectars cultures was compared. The method of maximum likelihood showed the best results for buckwheat and good one for corn and sunflower fields by 13/07/2016. Also this method showed good result for corn and sunflower fields, and poor result for identification of buckwheat fields by 29/07/2016.

The stage of flowering plants is the most important period of cropgrowth phase for beekeeping because it is the periodof formation of pollen and nectar. Therefore identification of bee forage has been analyzed vegetation period from germination to flowering.

A great deal of theoretical work exist today; it begun with Merton (1973) and Black &amp; Sholes (1973) and provided new insights into capital budgeting decision-making and new models, used today by corporate managers and practitioners too. Unfortunately, the ROT is not widely used by appraisers respect to the traditional DCF model, even though the developers behaviour gives evidence to the model. It is important to remember that the real estate investments are characterized by irreversible decision and by various sources of risk and uncertainty about future returns, especially when the development process is very long. The flexibility in the real estate investment is related to the alternative uses embedded in the land – traditionally interpreted through the Highest and Best Use approach – and to the characteristics of the building. In fact, the value of vacant land should reflect not only the value based on best immediate use, but also its <em>option value</em>, if the development is delayed and the land is converted into best alternative use in the future. This is also true for the redeveloped urban lands. In brief, this work shows the limits of the traditional analysis (Discounted Cash Flow Model) to capture flexibility in the real estate investment and presents an application – an industrial urban area – implemented by the real option approach within a backward risk-neutral valuation process.</span></p>";"Marina Bravi

For a specified period on one farm had between 12.0 to 78.8 ha of agricultural land (the most notable growth occurred in the period from 1990-1995, he was almost 100 times). 
Despite this, farming did not become efficient producers of agricultural products. 
In contrast, in the world more than 500 million farms (87,7%) of the total number belong to families that produce 56% of such production. In the US, family farms handle 78% of the agricultural land of the country, producing 84% of all agricultural products worth 230 billion dollars. In foreign countries is significantly different size of farms. In North America for a farmer falls from 190,0 to 600,0 ha, in most of the countries of Asia and Africa – 2,0 - 100,0 ha of land in Australia and New Zealand from 2 to 20 thousand hectares, and the like. In the EU land farms range from 2,0 – 500,0 ha. These countries are moving towards support of small, home gardens and farms.
The results of the research showed that farmers that are the main producers of agricultural products in the developed world are high-performance enterprises despite the size of the economy, because in these countries there is a deliberate policy to support agricultural producers to improve production efficiency, ensuring sustainable land management. The competitiveness of these farms is justified by the presence of the developed forecasting and planning their development strategies. Besides, in world practice there are three main types of enterprise development strategies, each of which is fully justified by the specificity of production: growth strategy (development), a strategy of constancy and survival strategy.

Using a quantitative approach based on land-use indicators and landscape metrics, distribution and fragmentation of built-up areas were analyzed from high-resolution and diachronic digital maps covering the investigated area (1,500 km2). The analysis of the (changing) urban structure during the study period allows for an indirect evaluation of planning impact on Rome's expansion. City's morphology changed rapidly due to urbanization. While in the first examined phase (1949-1974) metrics indicated compactness and densification trends, the fractal dimension of urban settlements increased in the subsequent period together with patch fragmentation, dispersion and shape complexity. The study identified the indicators better characterizing Rome's expansion as a contribution to the understanding of long-term urban dynamics in the Mediterranean region.

But where are we in this process now and what can be expected in the near future and what opportunities we are to curb the negative effects and to slow down the global warming.
The world’s population is more than 7 billion people now and we will live more than 9 billion on the planet in 2050 according to the conservative estimation because daily the number of inhabitants increases by approximitaly a quarter of a million people (National Rural Strategy, 2020).
The water and ecosystem resources are diminishing due to overuse and the values of ecological footprint  are very high especially in the developed countries. The increase of extreme weather events and its effects associated with the global warming have also growing impact on agricultural production. This phenomenon is important because to solve the famine and the water shortage will be much bigger problem due to climate change than today. 
The VAHAVA reports (change-impact-response) draw also attention to the issue which is also important for experts of climate change: Is it clearly climate change and if so than what the role of the human activity in it is? It seems clear that the assumption is almost poetic as the earth sends clear messages: the concentration of greenhouse gases increased suddenly in the atmosphere (carbon-dioxide, methan, nitrous oxide, etc), the average temperature continues to rise (increasing number of hot records), the sea temperature is also rising, the area of glaciers is shrinking dramatically and prolonged drought and flood waters in some places appear. The habitats of plans and animals, routes of bird migration change. The negative effects of extreme weather events thus represent a broad problem area. The effects can be devide into several groups. Some of them have impact already relatively short-term (for example affect of health of people) another part of them, however, exerts a negative influence in an indirect way for a long period of time. According to our present knowledge these processes are irreversible.
The 4th Water Report published by UNESCO is dealing with the one of the biggest problems which draws attention to hazards which are related water quality, groundwater, desertification, land degradation and drought (UNESCO, 2013). The report finds that the water problem occurs globally and it stresses the dangers of „isolated” thinking related to climate chnage. However, the isolated thinking appears not only within the geographical boundaries but it also can be observed in sectors together with the „isolated” solution search. Solution to the problems outlined as an innovation process have already begun in developed countries, however, the developing countries need serious help in that regard. The situation is further aggravated by perpetual competition for water between the ecosystem and socio-economic sectors.";"Tamás Molnár

Abstract

This paper aims to contribute to the debate on traditional communities, considering, therefore, the case of Community Rural Black Quilombola (CNRQ) Porto Dom João, who lives in São Francisco do Conde/ BA, alongside the Dom João river, in the mangrove and next to the sea. Thus think over the main issues involving this community today, highlighting the territorial conflict and the struggle to maintain the traditional lifestyle, linking them with the community housing style. The case of Porto Dom João reveals the capability of understanding social processes of struggling for territory in traditional communities from the analysis of their housing. It is confirmed from this study, that housing is one of the way of both social and cultural reproduction of these communities and constitutes an important component in the strategy to remain in the territory.

The objective of this research is to demonstrate a landscape-level approach to mapping and evaluating the
anthropogenic risks of grassland and forest habitat degradation by examining habitat context as defined by intensive
anthropogenic land uses at multiple spatial scales. A landscape mosaic model classifies a given location according to
the amounts of intensive agriculture and intensive development in its surrounding landscape, providing measures
of anthropogenic risks attributable to habitat isolation and edge effects at that location. The model is implemented
using a land-cover map (0.09 ha/pixel) of the conterminous United States and six landscape sizes (4.4, 15.2, 65.6,
591, 5300, and 47800 ha) to evaluate the spatial scales of anthropogenic risk. Statistics for grassland and forest
habitat are extracted by geographic overlays of the maps of land-cover and landscape mosaics. Depending on
landscape size, 81 to 94 percent of all grassland and forest habitat occurs in landscapes that are dominated by
natural land-cover including habitat itself. Within those natural-dominated landscapes, 50 percent of grassland
and 59 percent of forest is within 590 m of intensive agriculture and/or intensive developed land which is typically
a minor component of total landscape area. The conclusion is that anthropogenic risk attributable to habitat
patch isolation affects a small proportion of the total grassland or forest habitat area, while the majority of habitat
area is exposed to edge effects. ";"Kurt Riitters

It is believed that the efficiency of land use is the main indicator of the development of society and the state as a whole. Article 5 of the Land code of Ukraine defines ensuring rational use and protection of land the principle of land legislation. A study of the use and protection of land resources, analysis of specific measures of protection of land resources and soils is always relevant and is of interest to companies and scientists. Because the system of land use is in critical condition, the complexity and diversity of issues related to the implementation of the principles for sustainable land management in practice, necessitates further research. The purpose of this article analyzes the current state of use of agricultural lands in Ukraine and the definition of priority actions whose implementation will contribute to improving the efficiency of agricultural land use, the protection and rational use of agricultural land.

Ukraine is one of Europe's largest countries, covering an area of almost 6% in Europe, and agricultural land account for about 19% of European, including arable land - nearly 27%. In the structure of agricultural land arable land occupies 78.1 per cent, which is significantly more than in the European countries and the USA. All this is evidence of the high level of development and the load on agricultural soil cover, increases the likelihood of proliferation threats of erosion processes and degradation of the land Fund of the country As of 01.01.2016 g in Ukraine, the largest share belongs to agricultural land 42.7 million ha or 70.8 per cent, the second place is occupied by forests and forest lands is 10.6 million ha, or 17.6 percent, the third – the territory is covered by water bodies is 2.4 million ha or 4.0 %. Agrarian reform in Ukraine has led to significant changes in agriculture, in particular it partly influenced the structure of agricultural lands.

The territory of Ukraine is characterized by extremely high rate of agricultural development that significantly exceeds the environmentally sound limits. In comparison with European countries, arable land can reach 30-32% of the total area, the destruction of the Ukrainian lands - 53.9 per cent Currently, there is a steady tendency of deterioration of qualitative condition of soils, in particular decreasing reserves of humus, the nutrient content of the ongoing processes of acidification, salinization and erosion, leading to degradation and desertification of the soil cover. In a market environment an important principle of land use is the economic feasibility of their involvement in the production, which is characterized by the return on the cost of cultivation of agricultural crops. The main factors of increase of efficiency of land use in agriculture are: productivity of agricultural production; farming system; the fertility of the earth. Economic efficiency of use of agricultural land in Ukraine is characterized by positive dynamics. So, slowly rising, gross output, crop yields, gross collection

Crop yields tends to increase: in fruit and berry crops by 123 %, the yield of sugar beet increased by 72 %, and grain and leguminous crops by 24% in comparison with 1990. The size of the gross harvest of agricultural products, in physical terms showed a significant decrease in the level of land resources use in Ukraine. So, the gross harvest of sugar beet in 2015 decreased by 65% compared to 1990. But other crops held positive dynamics – the increase in gross collection on 12850,3 thousand tons of grain and leguminous crops and 7563 thousand tons of sunflower. In the conditions of market economy the state should use the instruments of adjustment trends in the use of resources in agriculture for the benefit of national interests, but it does not blow up The basis of formation of effective usage of agricultural lands, in addition to allocated land legislation, there should be organizational-economic and land-legal principles: the unity of political, economic, environmental and technological approaches to agricultural land use; a comprehensive solution to issues of effective use of land and other natural resources; accounting for zonal differences in the placement and use of land resources for agricultural purposes; consideration of multifunctionality of land in agriculture; priority agriculture land.";"Bavrovska N.M.

"DOAJ:4f9f1d994a5b453ca2a223a20369c0df";"PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION AND FORMATION LAND OF AVIATION TRANSPORT";"";"Independent Ukraine had 50 permanently operating airports in 1991. Nowdays there are currently only 20 operating airports in Ukraine, 2/3 of which require reconstruction and substantial technical re-equipment. Without proper investment, Ukraine is able to lose its status as a transit state, as it is unable to recover its transport infrastructure independently. In connection with this, the international experience of the development of airports, particularly in the Baltic States, Georgia, Norway, Poland, deserves special attention. There are the involvement of foreign companies in the management and reconstruction of airports, especially for the development of tourism and recreation, the coordination of the network of airports with the creation of funds for the development of air routes, the implementation of integrated airport development programs, reducing the base of aviation fees due to the growth of non-aviation revenue, increasing competition in the air transport market through the successful functioning of not only national carriers, but also low-cost carriers.

The land-resource potential of different types of transport  is the basis of development of the transport system of the country, and also the spatial base. Regulation of land use are conducted  depend on the main purpose of the land. A feature of aviation land use transport is the concentration on a small area of land of a significant number of objects and structures of various functional purposes, which provide the work of aviation transport, and require appropriate planning of the territories of airfields and airports. Proceeding from the fact that the airfield belongs to strategic objects, and the airport terminal is considered the object of investment, the separation of land of aviation transport by ownership (state, communal, private) and types of use (concession, rent, superficiencies, servitude) are rather complex and extremely important task of land management of the respective territories. Land-use restrictions on aviation transport on adjacent airport territories cover large areas of land.

Formation of aviation land-use and ecologically safe use of land of aviation transport is an extremely topical subject of scientific research in modern conditions. The main task is the development of scientific bases and methodological provisions for the formation, operation and regulation of the use of land potential of the aviation industry and methodological recommendations of land management of objects of aviation transport. The indicated problems were almost not investigated by Ukrainian scientists.

The separation of land and property of airports of state, communal and private property is the serious problem in modern time.  Due to the violation of the principle that an aerodrome is a strategic object that is not able to privatized, and a terminal is an investment object, including private property, only in 5 years it was possible to return the communal property to the Odessa airport, which in 2011 was transferred to offshore investors. The registration of land occupied has not been completed by other airports, and the corresponding legal documents have been issued to them.

In accordance with the State Target Program for the Development of Airports, it is planned to implement a range of appropriate measures to ensure the construction, reconstruction and modernization of facilities.

It is necessary to reflect in the State Land Cadastre the data on the registration of aerodrome territories as restrictions on land use associated with the operation of aviation transport, to make necessary changes to the Law of Ukraine ""On State Land Cadastre"" and the Procedure for State Land Cadastre.

This issue is very important both for agricultural system functionality and, consequently, for its permanence. This paper proposes an analyzing tool of land use changes to support planning policies, in order to highlight the major determinants of land use that affect the permanence of agricultural activity. The case studies are Lodi, Milan and Monza Brianza Provinces, in Lombardy Region. One of the most important results are that exogenous variables, like population density or real estate value of residential buildings, are the most influencing agricultural land loss.</p>";"Chiara Mazzocchi

Hence, it is necessary to conform the definitions, measures, and representations of the soil consumption, to have reliable information to build policies and intervention programmes. At the same time it is important to identify some shared principles to contrast this phenomenon: the awareness of the public relevance of the soil functions; the inefficiency due to the externalities connected with its use; the need for differentiated solutions; the necessity to adopt an incremental long-term perspective; the opportunities provided by a set of normative, fiscal, and planning instruments; the urgency to act in the places most subject to land transformation pressures, such as the peri-urban areas, in which experience a new alliance between the city and the countryside.";"Stefano Pareglio";"";"Firenze University Press";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-01-31";"en;it";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.13128/Aestimum-17880";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.fupress.net/index.php/ceset/about/editorialPolicies#openAccessPolicy";"15"

Over the past 30-40 years, the growth rate of population in many countries of the world is ahead of the growth rate of agricultural production, which leads to acute shortage of food. This is especially true of developing countries, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of the population of the planet that is under-eating and starving. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), in the world now about half a billion people are constantly hungry and twice asleep.

Insufficient consumption affects children in particular. Nearly 300 million children in Asia, Africa and Latin America are lagging behind in physical and mental development as a result of poor nutrition. Every day from hunger there are about 12 thousand people dying.

According to FAO, food products around the world are produced in general enough to feed the entire population of the Earth. However, the main reason for the global food crisis is not that products are distributed among countries irrelevant to the population, although such a problem exists. Researchers believe that the food crisis is caused by the coincidence of demographic, environmental and energy problems with the effects of adverse weather conditions, as well as a colossal increase in military spending.

Investigated the interconnection between the dynamics of population growth and world food production volumes with the areas of agricultural land and the possible influence of projected changes in agricultural land use on increasing the cost of agricultural land is substantiated.

It was investigated that the average national land rent in Ukraine would increase by 25.5%.

For this purpose, land cover maps for these years were created to identify the new urban expansion axis. Maps of the census sectors of both years were also made with the percentage of households attended by the basic sanitation services infrastructure, as well as the population density and average income of the householder. Considering the results, we have observed that the investments in basic sanitation infrastructure in the last ten years were not sufficient, given the fact that the region with the largest population of Minas Gerais still has precarious conditions regarding the access to water supply and sewage networks.

Observa-se que desde a década de 1970 tem-se pensado em diferentes modelos de desenvolvimento de turismo para a Amazônia, almejando o progresso econômico e social.  Neste processo, na década de 1970, a Superintendência de Desenvolvimento da Amazônia (SUDAM), deu inicio a discursão de criação do primeiro Plano de Turismo da Amazônia (PTA) que deu inicio na década de 1980 até 1985.  A partir da década de 1990 as estratégias de turismo para a região foram desenvolvidas em conformidade com a preocupação mundial em torno da natureza e do homem.  Produto deste contexto, o II PTA foi lançado com o objetivo principal de desenvolver medidas que conciliassem o desenvolvimento econômico às questões ambientais e sociais. Outra ação também importante para esse período foi a promoção do desenvolvimento regional por meio de polos de turismo integrados, conforme determinava o PROECOTUR. O objetivo deste artigo, portanto, consiste em destacar as primeiras políticas públicas de turismo para o desenvolvimento dos estados e municípios da Amazônia que deram inicio a partir de 1970. Para isso, a estruturação conceitual do trabalho fundamentou-se em políticas públicas e planejamento de turismo na Amazônia. Utiliza-se como metodologia a pesquisa documental, por meio de diagnóstico que enfatiza os principais resultados obtidos pelos I e II Planos de Turismo da Amazônia, a partir da interpretação e análise documental; O artigo também adota a pesquisa bibliográfica, pois analisa as principais estratégias de desenvolvimento do turismo na Amazônia. A partir de tal análise, conclui-se que as mudanças políticas de turismo ocorridas na Amazônia entre a década de 1970 e 1990 - apesar de estarem acompanhadas por ações de planejamento do governo nacional e até mesmo pelas tendências mundiais - não conseguiram promover um planejamento adequado às necessidades e características da região, trazendo com isso uma ideia deturpada de desenvolvimento turístico para a Amazônia.

This tool considers topics such as land use, population density and street width. The purpose of this technique is to incorporate it to the Master Plan, as a town planning instrument, so as to cope with traffic forecasting and congestion. However, the technique does not embrace any sustainability concept, this is due to a disregard of any district ´s social or environmental needs. Therefore a sustainable urban development would doubtfully be reached. It is argued that some other approaches are required for shaping a sustainable built environment in which it is understood that the streets are a public space for people rather than a platform for moving vehicles only. This means, to promote accessibility as well as mobility. In this paper the author reviews borrowed concepts such as ""carrying capacity"" and ""environmental capacity"" from bioregionalist and ecological disciplines using a case study in outskirts of Santiago´s metro area./La ""capacidad vial"" del Plan Regulador chileno es una herramienta desarrollada para medir la capacidad de las calles en términos de apoyar el tamaño del flujo de vehículos. Esta herramienta considera temas como el uso de la tierra, la densidad de población y ancho de la calle. El propósito de esta técnica es su incorporación al Plan Maestro, como un instrumento de planificación de la ciudad, con el fin de hacer frente a la previsión del tráfico y la congestión. Sin embargo, la técnica no incluye ningún concepto de sostenibilidad. Por lo tanto un desarrollo urbano sostenible dudosamente sería alcanzado.

Production of consumable material, which is required for increasing population in various areas, and their attractions make it possible to earn more profit and it causes a significant pressure on soil and water resources and can threaten environmental pollution and human food security. A self-interested attitude on land resources has led to run short-term programs without considering the ecological capability of the land. These mentioned problems are, significantly intensified particularly in arid and semi-arid areas with severe limitations of water and soil quality and quantity. Therefore, land allocation based on ecological capability and self-purification indexes, used for land use planning, is an appropriate response to meet the deficiencies noted. This paper studies the agricultural capable lands based on land capability. The proposed study uses GIS software capabilities with application of the environmental ability evaluation model, as a holistic approach, to make sustainable development research in the region. The results indicate that suitable lands for agriculture in the whole area in different classes are widespread and with regards to dependency of more than 90 percent of people to agricultural activities, serious attention of authorities is required for providing the appropriate baseline and avoiding land use change to develop this activity.";"Sedigheh Kiani Salmi

Attractive landscape and experience of nature are the most important reasons to visit this region and to spend leisure time there. Particularly mountain meadows, raised bogs and mixed forests are highly appreciated. Deforestation, industrial development and the decline of biodiversity would reduce attractiveness for visitors. We also assessed whether the tourism sector is prepared to contribute to the funding of nature conservation and landscape management. Use of general tax revenues is favoured, but other modes would also be accepted, e.g. a nature tax. Willingness to pay (WTP) is ranging between €0.75 and €1.36 per guest per night by TSP, or between €1.06 and €2.73 per day by visitors. With respect to landscape preference and WTP we found in some cases significant differences among visitors, depending on region of residence, age and education level. A major part of the annual costs for nature conservation and landscape could be covered by public funds (taxes), if the results of the WTP approach were understood as a sign of societal demand and a call to action.";"Christian Stein

According to this in the article analysis of the degradation processes in agricultural landscapes, development of land management projects as a tool for optimization of land use and protection of agricultural landscapes are discussed.

Theoretical and methodological basis of research is dialectical theory of knowledge, the comprehensive, systematic approach to the study of foreign experience and national practice of investigated problems, use of general and special methods of basic laws and regulations of economic theory.

Much attention is given to the negative phenomena of agricultural land use, including water erosion and formation the ways of economically efficient, ecologically safety and socially oriented land use. Studied the experience of foreign countries on the mechanism of land use and providing   safety use in dangerous erosion agricultural landscapes.

Caused by anthropogenic degradation processes in agricultural landscapes mainly due of the intensity of cultivation, use of erosion dangerous lands, breach of crop rotation, decrease area with grasses crop, unsystematic use of natural grasslands. Conscious of the needs to implementation control of erosion, land users don’t do it at once and quickly. Because economic activity while profits more than production costs or costs associated with the implementation of erosion control measures, including contour-reclamation organization of territory. However, in the future this approach could lead to economically efficient, socially and environmentally threatening and dangerous land use.

Land has a number of features that distinguish it among other resources. Such as means of production and the subject of labor in agriculture and forestry, base of industries location, environmental and social regulator etc. Therefore, there is a need to preserve and improve the properties of the land for future generations.

Providing an integrated approach to planning land use and protection, including protection of soil in the context of sustainable development is one of the basic key of ""Agenda XXI"", ""Strategy for sustainable development of Ukraine - 2020"" and ""Sustainable development of Ukraine during 2016-2030"".

In the context of a new climate agreement established by Paris conference where marked action by conservation and increasing absorbent of greenhouse gases, an important role as a ground like controller carbon and nitrogen cycles. High capacity for carbon sequestration are degraded soils in the process of restoring their properties. Potential of soil for absorption and retention of carbon can be increased by soil-reproduction techniques, including erosion control measures.

Land management is quite a tool that has evolved to a multi-role that should provide a basis for decision-making in all areas related with land and land use. Therefore, development and implementation of land management projects of land use and protection can be and should be the basis for the implementation of safety land use in dangerous erosion agricultural landscapes. These projects will provide slowing and stopping anthropogenically accelerated erosion processes from one hand, and ensure efficient economic activity from other.

Land management projects should include land zoning for allotment of eco-technology groups of arable land, according to which a decision on further land use and development of agricultural landscapes and placing  shelterbelts, which should be an essential component of  landscapes.

Therefore, for safety land use in dangerous erosion agricultural landscapes consider the following: the differential use of agricultural land depending of soil cover and relief; observance of safe slope drainage of runoff; meadow slopes along drainage channels; shelterbelts placement systems for water and wind regulatory.";"V.

The change in awareness of the role of nature in human life and place of man in the biological chain of the planet also changed the approaches to the creation of protected areas, measures of protection and management system and environmental and economic instruments of environmental land use.

In Europe, there is an understanding that most of our biodiversity is found in semi-natural habitats that depend on long-term human management. This is reflected in the diversity of conservation policy types and strategies that have been developed in recent decades. Modern approaches recognize that well-managed nature conservation areas not only support important ecosystems and threatened species, but also provide many benefits to humans, including a range of ecosystem services. In practice, you can observe various types of management for protected areas.

One of the forms of protected land use in Ukraine is the territory and objects of the nature reserve fund. Their successful use depends on a clear and coordinated management mechanism.

Classic studies have demonstrated that urban warming is a regional and occasional phenomenon whose occurrence depends on weather conditions and characteristics of the urban fabric. Satellite imagery and GIS are combined in this paper to unveil patterns in thermal variations across cities and relate air temperature to density or land cover. Six European regions were selected: Madrid (40ºN, 3ºE), Cologne (50ºN, 6ºE), Barcelona (41ºN,2ºE) London (51ºN,0.5ºW), Brussels(50ºN,4ºE) and Berlin(52ºN,13ºE). Images with information on surface temperature were obtained from Modis Satellite database. Over 120 files were scrutinized to select 6 winter and summer days and nights. From these, six summer nights are presented as they offer the clearest land surface temperature distribution. The spatial correlation between air temperature, density and land cover was analysed in GIS and plotted as citywide cross sections. The strongest correspondence was found between density and land cover. Finally, the influence of UHI in the energy demand of domestic buildings in London and Barcelona was investigated.

The case farms’ ability to pay annual rates between 0.25 per cent and 1 per cent of the value of improved land using real annual economic profit with and without rebates of up to 70 per cent proposed by the Department: Provincial and Local Government ranged from zero to five out of five years, with a mean of two out of five years. A 2 per cent land tax rate with such rebates could also be financed only in two out of five years on average.

"DOAJ:ae807cc0782e4b20b213db6a380706ae";"Ecosystem Services at the Landscape Scale: the Need for Integrative Approaches";"";"During the symposium “Ecosystem Services at the Landscape Scale” from the EU-IALE conference 2009, several
challenges for future research on approaches to use the concept of ecosystem services at the landscape scale were
identified, focussing on the need for integration. Three main research directions were discussed, (i) the definition
of the potentials and limitations of the ecosystem service approach for landscape analysis, (ii) the identification of
suitable methods and tools to apply the ecosystem service approach at the landscape scale and (iii) the demand of
incorporating ecosystem and landscape services in decision making and management. This paper briefly addresses
and discusses some of these topics and puts them into a broader perspective. From this viewpoint it becomes obvious
that many high-quality sectoral studies are carried out, e.g. concentrating on specific services or specific linkages
within the “ecosystem service cascade” which describes the relation between biophysical characteristics of the landscape,
their functions, services, benefits and values for society. In order to provide useful information for decision
makers, ecosystem services studies should be supplemented by investigations of the whole systems of interactions
between ecological processes and societal valuations.";"Felix Müller

"DOAJ:6f7e5467e586437f8c7a4d56abbfafd9";"PUBLICITY OF PLANNING DOCUMENTATION AS A PREREQUISITE FOR EFFECTIVE PUBLIC CONTROL OF URBAN SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT";"";"Nowadays, government transparency is one of the fundamental principles of functioning of the rule of law, in which participation of the public in the formulation and implementation of public policy and its impact on all stages of decision-making and public access to the full objective and reliable information held by authorities should be provided.

The interaction with the public is a key in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, which is prepared to the signing and implementation.

Ukraine moves to decentralization, and the main problem is to optimize the structure of administrative units, which are characterized by high fragmentation, especially in rural areas. Most rural councils are unable to provide even basic services to the local population at the district level. This leads to a decrease in financial resources of village councils.

Decentralization of authority will enable administrative-territorial units to become more self-sufficient, provide fiscal autonomy, the distribution of income and expenditure, a clear division of authorities’ competences.

This particularly touches rural areas that are now largely depressed administrative entities. Local interests may be assessed much better by local authority than central.

The order of publication of regulatory and urban acts is arranged by applicable law quite well and logically.

Therefore, it can be similarly applied to all other legal acts.

As every planning document, the community territory plan is approved by the local government, but should be developed by a certified institution, organization. This plan should provide answers to the question: what is the situation now; the current and future land-use, what are the prospects of development of the community in land management. Community management has the right and even the duty to decide on changes in the plan. Because in this plan will be shown in reality how and which way you can change the intended land-use.

Territorial communities can attract investors when they will have a transparent system of land-use. To do this, there should be a legislation act, which provides the right to manage land throughout the jurisdiction of the unified local community, established under the long-term plan and with the approval of the planning documents for the respective territory of the community

There is an urgent need for appropriate changes to the Land Code and adoption of transfer of land ownership from one form to another, which should reflect the European countries’ practice in the field.";"Medynska N.";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-05-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"UKR";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/7198/6983";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"5"
"DOAJ:4fc90b6374f546209ace4ffa4e887941";"On new methodological and other standards in planning: The case of the Master Plan of Belgrade 2021";"";"As elsewhere in the ex-communist/socialist countries, the former planning system in Yugoslavia has been dismantled as from the beginning of 1990s, and the planning practice has from then onwards been steered by an apart mixture of old habits, few institutional innovations and the social, economic and political turbulence of the transition period. The previous system and practice of socioeconomic planning collapsed, so far not to be substituted for by new arrangements, to match the impact of the key factors of the transition period, i.e., political pluralization, privatization and marketisation. On the other hand, albeit the system of spatial/urban and environmental planning has been 're-touched' in the 1990s, the adjustments undertaken have not either been harmonized with the factors mentioned. What can now be recognized as the existing 'planning system' is, however, an strange mix of heterogeneous elements from a number of disparate modes, i.e., 'crisis-management-planning', 'planning-supported-wild-marketisation-and-privatisation', 'project-based-planning', etc. In effect, there is no overall professional and political consensus on the direction and content of reform in this field (which also applies to other key issues). In sum, the existing situation in the planning system and practice reads as follows: (1) The system has almost lost its legitimacy, partly because the majority of the former public interests collapsed, and new, indisputable public interests still not being established. Under such circumstances, new roles of planning are hardly known to the public at large, in part as a consequence of an overall anti-planning stance among the majority of political, economic and expert elites. (2) The inertia rules the professional landscape, since there has been a lack of new approaches and methodologies, to match the impact of new dominant factors and the miserable social and economic conditions in the country. Regarding the approaches and methodologies applied, the traditional ex ante planning evaluation still prevails, and more ex post and ex continuo evaluation is still missing. (3) The planning system is too centralized (within the two republics), since the radical recentralization of Serbia was undertaken in 1990, and subsequently the sub-national tiers were deprived of almost any effective planning instruments. In addition to this, the majority of regional entities ('districts') and communes lack a competent administrative machinery and expertise, as well as other support (e.g., research, planning information support etc.) for effecting autonomous planning policies. (4) There has been no more ambitious strategic planning (which is, however, somehow understandable vis-à-vis only now ended international sanctions and isolation of the country). On the other hand, the majority of the development documents that have been passed in the meantime, grossly lack elaborated implementation devices (policies and instruments). Especially in the field of urban planning, the detailed ('land use') schemes prevail over the more strategic development schemes for larger urban and regional areas. Specific development projects (and, only sometimes, more harmonized programmes) by far outnumber other planning schemes. (5) The integration and harmonization of various aspects of planning and policy, i.e., social, economic, spatial/urban, environmental, is very poor. In effect, physicalism still dominates the scene in spatial and urban planning, and the elements of socioeconomic development and environmental policy are scarce within this block. (6) The stipulated legal propositions pertaining to the openness, participativeness and transparency of the planning/policy procedures fall easily frail in the planning practice, resulting in the very poor content in this regard. (7) There has been a lack of planners and other experts experienced and knowledgeable in practicing planning under the new circumstance of political pluralism and radically changed structure of stakeholders and concomitant institutional arrangements. This also applies to 'educators' in general, because the prolonged international isolation of the FR Yugoslavia has caused the gross of their knowledge and capabilities irrelevant. In sum, it seems that many planners would not be able to assume new roles that they are expected to on the part of the society at large. (8)The planning/policy information, research, institutional and other support provided by the state and other agents often does not satisfy even the most basic needs in this fields, partly for a general scarcity of resources concomitant to the overall and deep social, economic and political crisis the society found itself in the 1990s. (9) Most frightfully, manipulation, paternalism and clientelism still represent dominant forms of power, which is a problem by itself in Yugoslavia being one of the most corruptive countries in the world. What is now most missing is a non-manipulative persuasion, as well as the authority of professional values, as the communication and interaction forms that seem only promising for and supportive to developing of a democratic, emancipatory and transformative planning mode. A number of attempts during the last decade to embark upon the preparation of the new 'Master Plan of the City Belgrade' (in the sequel: MP) came into realization not before the democratic political changes of October 2000 took place in Serbia. However, the so far undertaken steps do not seem promising, as they failed to satisfy a number of methodological and other standards, as well as to introduce necessary innovations. Unfortunately, the MP was commissioned to the Bureau of Urban Planning of the City of Belgrade (otherwise a 'faithful ally' of all non-democratic regimes in the City's urban planning and related matters over the last more than ten years now, during which there has been a so far unrecorded squandering and illegal privatization of public urban assets, mostly uncontrolled and not paid-for). Similarly, vested are to lead and complete the work mostly the experts/planners who 'controlled' and still 'control' the academic and professional scene in the same period (notwithstanding that were compromised and their abilities proved passé on many occasions), now recycled to perform new mission. Albeit the entire project had not been adequately prepared, already two interim documents have been elaborated now, viz., 'A Hypothesis of the Master Plan of Belgrade 2021', and 'A Concept of the Master Plan of Belgrade 2021'. In what follows, a brief review of the work done so far is presented: (1) The role of the MP is poorly defined, which is strange vis-à-vis the pronounced thesis on the 'insuperable role of market', which one renders puzzle about the veritable role of the MP. In addition to this, physicalism features as the key characteristic of this document: social and economic aspects of development are insufficiently present and poorly integrated into the MP, and so are the environmental aspects. The MP will however have to assume a part of socioeconomic development planning and policy as well, because the latter is predictably not likely to get recuperated in some time to come. Furthermore, the social, economic and environmental problems of Belgrade are so tremendous (e.g., extremely high rate of unemployment, probably around 40% of the total work force, obsolete technological, market and other structure of the larger part of Belgrade economy, prolonged crisis of economic growth, overall pauperization of the overwhelming majority of people, many hundred thousand refugees, few hundred thousand of young and educated people who left the country, disproportionate environmental pollution as compared to the level of economic development, etc.), that they must not be ignored in the development documents like the MP. (2) There is no sound conception on the public interests, particularly under the circumstances of a large number of legitimate individual interests fast emerging on the political scene, some of which also persisting to impose themselves as new and legitimate public interests. This results in a feeble notion on the existing and predictable future conflicts, as well as on the planning mechanisms and instruments that will be used in their control and management. (3) The concept of sustainable development has been only 'flirted with' in the MP, whereby a sound doctrine upon which development is to be directed and articulated is also missing (i.e., that which is of relevance for a territorial entity with the GDP of not more than some USD 1 500 per capita). (4) No efforts have been made to introduce more relevant methodological approach, i.e., those which would contrast the miserable socioeconomic and environmental fixities, viz.: (i) A more rigorous ex post evaluation of past decisions has not been performed, implying that future steps will be undertaken upon rather anecdotal insights in the existing power structure, institutional and organizational arrangements and dominant communication and interaction modes in planning. In the same context, the most significant problem of Belgrade area, i.e., how to approach the economic and ecological renewal and rehabilitation of its economy, has been hardly paid sufficient attention to. (This also applies to the position of Belgrade in the broader regional Euro-Asian context, which has terribly eroded over the last decade). (ii) Although the intention of the whole exercise is to work out a 'hard product', i.e., a urban development plan, no ex ante evaluation scheme has been produced so far, implying that the job is not being performed lege artis. Apart from other implications, this failure is particularly handicapping regarding the criteria of ex ante evaluation, leaving the professional audience and the public at large without the sound answers on key questions: What are the criteria upon which the evaluation has been undertaken? Whose are they? What interests stand behind them? Who decides on the criteria that will be applied? Apart from softening the rigour of the expertise, this flaw also allows for too ample 'maneuvering space' for the subsequent arbitrating to be performed by the politicians. (5) A trend-based extrapolation has been used as the key prognostic technique, which is absolutely unacceptable, keeping in mind the poor predictive power (I) and unstable institutional arrangements in planning and elsewhere (II). Instead, the political community would necessitate a number of veritable alternative scenarios of possible/desirable future development elaborated and presented for discussion, deliberation and decision-making in expert arenas and public forums. (6) Perhaps the weakest part of the MP goes to the issue of implementation of planning decisions, giving way to 'visioning' (in effect, to another planning 'phantasmagory'), which is again unacceptable vis-à-vis the pressing and burning realities of Belgrade and its broader surroundings. (7) Finally, an open, transparent and publicly verified 'offer to strategic partners' would also be needed, as the City does not have enough internal resources to cope with the problems of its economic, social, physical and environmental renewal. To conclude, major improvements are needed regarding the planning approach and methodology applied in the preparation of the Master Plan of the City of Belgrade 2021. As this project is likely to carry considerable demonstrational effects throughout the planning scene in Yugoslavia, its highly professional execution is of necessity, so that a major damage is avoided, i.e., that of a further loss of the legitimacy of planning and erosion of the planning profession.";"Vujošević Miodrag L.";"";"Institute of Architecture and Urban & Spatial Planning of Serbia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2002-12-31";"sr";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"SRB";"Peer-reviewed publication";"";"http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0354-6055/2002/0354-60550209085V.pdf";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-SA";"http://scindeks.ceon.rs/PublicationPolicy.aspx?issn=0354-6055&lang=en#ppLC";"4"

On the basis of analysis concerning the powers of the central executive authorities, local authorities found that the newly farmed Service State Land Cadastre das not contribute to the effectiveness of the administration, especially at the national level, as these features ave not provided by ""Regulations on State Land Cadastre "" and other regulations. In addition, the local level detected removal of local government in matters of land relations.

In conclusion, proposed system based redistribution of powers on the level of central executive bodies and local authorities to reform the system of land management with regard to decentralized processes in Ukraine.

It is advisable to restore central authority for land reform and regulation of land relations to the structure of the executive authorities in coordinating its activities directly to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine or the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and provide the following powers:

1)  development of legislation in the sphere of land relations for the development and implementation of the state land policy;

2)  coordination of the completion of land reform;

3)  cadastre at national level;

4)   land management at the national level;

5)   monitoring at the national level;

6)   state control over the land use and land protection.

Additionally organization and territorial measures are projected that increase the ecological sustainability of the area: key, binders, buffer areas and renewable ecological network.

The regional scheme of ecological network is intended for usage while projecting of creation of new territories that fall under special protection, for defining the tasks as for changing the category of land in the land use planning documents, for development of specifications regarding the reproduction of natural systems on conservation ready lands withdrawn from agricultural use, for accounting the problems of formation the areas of ecological network in forest management and land management projects, while development of the projects of areas organization of natural - reserve fund, in the definition of wetlands of international importance, in determining the habitats of various plants and animals of various categories of protection in accordance with international conventions and national laws - regulations, in planning targeted actions in the conservation of landscape and biological diversity.

The main stages of designing local ecological network are:

• inventory and identification of rights for land and other natural resources, drawing created territories and objects of natural reserve fund and other areas of natural systems on the planning and cartographic materials, which are under special protection;

• rationale of creating additional territories and objects of nature preserves and other areas of valuable natural systems, which are under special protection as a key and defining the boundaries of renewable, buffer and connecting areas for the providing of the formation of the ecological network as a unified spatial system of ecological frame of conservation land using cartograms of agro-industrial groups of soils and terrain rural area (village) councils;

• development of registers of territorial restrictions (encumbrances) in land use and other natural resources in the area and objects of nature preserves and other areas under special protection, recovery, binding and buffer areas of ecological network, as well as proposals for regime change of land use and use of other natural resources;

• coordination with the General scheme and regional schemes of eco network about limits of areas of its components in adjacent areas, with Pan-European Ecological Network taking into account modern state, public and private interests, identifying promising areas to ensure conservation and rational management of landscapes and other natural systems, other objects and territories.

According to the Law of Ukraine ""On Land Management"", there is not any particular type of documentation on land use, as for designing structural elements of econet, therefore there is a need in justification of features of such projecting and its legislative resolution. On the basis of land management projects on the formation of components of the ecological network in the context of rural councils it’s possible to determine the boundaries of the restriction (encumbrances) zones, its area and draw their registry and regulations of land use to meet the requirements of rational land use and protection, preservation of natural diversity of landscapes, environment, maintaining ecological balance.";"Tretiak V.

Numerous conflicts exist: between wider public larger social interests (land occupation, removal-power production), short-term and long-term goals, specific and general aims, etc. Basic developmental conflicts exist in the relationship between the miming-energy-industrial system and its environment, and they are manifested in areas of regional development, incompatible production functions (mining-agriculture), lend use and organization, exploitation of natural resources, and environmental degradation. Thus, one of the most important planning task in large mining basins is to identify, evaluate, confront and compare development conflicts and developmental goals. The task of the planning process is to offer objective parameters (indices) concerning the state of development, its potentials and limitations, as well as the concept of alternative strategies of future development, including their possible effects, conversion of larger social priorities into criteria for evaluating alternative strategies, i.e. to offer adequate analytical documents as a platform for the expression of goals and interests of numerous social subjects and their harmonization in the process of participation in planing decision making.";"Spasić Nenad

Diante desse contexto, o Turismo de Base Comunitária (TBC), que resiste ao modelo turístico dos resorts, e aproxima visitante, local e comunidade, tem se apropriado das diretrizes ambientais que o Ecoturismo propõe. No estado do Ceará-Brasil, vem funcionando como alternativa para a preservação dos ecossistemas litorâneos intensamente alterados pela expansão das atividades de carcinicultura em manguezais, instalação de usinas eólicas nos parques de dunas, especulação imobiliária e implantação de resorts. Com apoio institucional, comunidades litorâneas cearenses têm desenvolvido o Turismo Comunitário, visando à manutenção e preservação das áreas onde residem e buscando uma alternativa de renda para as populações locais. Objetivando analisar o desenvolvimento do Turismo Comunitário como mecanismo para uma utilização sustentável dos ecossistemas litorâneos no estado do Ceará, esse estudo analisou o desenvolvimento dessa atividade na Comunidade de Curral Velho, no município de Acaraú-CE, onde o TBC vem se desenvolvendo desde 2006. Visitas a campo, entrevistas informais com lideranças da Comunidade e análises de imagens de satélite do local, auxiliaram na percepção do quadro socioambiental da área. Conciliando a técnica das instituições que apoiam o TBC ao conhecimento popular dos moradores, esta modalidade de turismo tem se desenvolvido em Curral Velho na tentativa de frear a ampliação da carcinicultura e conscientizar um público diversificado acerca da preservação dos ecossistemas litorâneos, alcançando substanciais mudanças na Comunidade.

In this context, different mapping techniques are presented by example of three case studies covering terrestrial, coastal and marine environments. The first case study was selected to demonstrate how to compute an ecological land classification of Germany by means of CART. The resulting ecoregions were mapped by GIS. This CARTography enables to regionalise metal bioaccumulation data in terms of 21 ecological land categories and to prove the specifity of emission control measures as being part of environmental policies. The second investigation was chosen to applyfor the first time in Germany the regionalisation approach to the research of climate change effects in terms of past, recent and potential future incidences of Anopheles sp. and malaria in Lower Saxony. To investigate whether malaria might be transmitted due to increasing air temperatures, data sets on past and future air temperatures were used to spatially model malaria risk areas. The third example demonstrates the transfer of the CARTography approach presented in the first case study from terrestrial to marine environments. We analysed the statistical relations between data on benthic communities and physical properties of their marine environments by means of CART and applied these rules to geodata which only describe physical characteristics of the benthic habitats. By this, those parts of the sea ground could be predicted where certain benthic communities might occur.";"W. Schröder

Além disso, caracterizar a área do objeto de estudo com uma visão holística e estabelecer teoricamente os meios de viabilizar o segmento na localidade. A metodologia empregada partiu da pesquisa bibliográfica (livros e sites), documental e de campo, com aplicação de questionários fechados e a observação simples. A pesquisa revelou singularidades e potencialidades na região quanto à implantação do turismo no espaço rural, com destaque para a população local que se mostrou disposta a participar da atividade, condição que favorece o processo de implementação do turismo em áreas rurais. Assim, conclui-se que o planejamento estratégico e participativo deve existir antes do início da exploração turística, a fim de priorizar a anulação de possíveis impactos negativos sobre a comunidade.

The high level of technological loading on land resources causes the development of degradation processes, and as a result – reduced lands productivity. The main reasons are: unbalanced development of the productive forces and exhausting exploitation of land resources, producers ignoring of environmental imperatives, technical, technological and organizational backwardness of agricultural production; embryonic nature of ecological and economical mechanism of land use and realization of land protection measures, the lack of perfect legal framework of regulating and management of resource- ecological security at national, regional and local levels.

Increasing of anthropogeneous pressure on soil (excessive soil tillage in agricultural landscapes, ecologically unsustainable use of agricultural chemicals, high intensity of heavy agricultural machinery, etc.) leads to increase of degradation processes almost on the all area of arable land (Medvedev, 1994). So important is the continuous monitoring of agrophysical condition of soils and development of scientific and practical foundations of optimizing the physical parameters of fertility.

The environmentally unbalanced application of anthropogeneous factors results in agrophysical degradation of arable lands, what is displaied in top soil overcompaction.Experimentally found that depending on how the agricultural land use equilibrium bulk density of the gray forest soils varies between 1,35-1,58 g/cm3, dark-gray forest soils - 1,36-1,44, podzolized chernozem - 1,26-1,33, typical chernozem- 1,09-1,18 g/cm3, that indicating the imbalance of soil-physical factors, a significant deviation from the requirements of crops and could lead eventually to lower soil fertility on 50-60 % (Bondarev, 1989).

To reduce the load process should be at soil-climatic zones and the landscape in general - to optimize the lands structure and sowing areas through technological distribution of arable land with regard to their suitability for growing of majorcropsgroups; at a particular catchment (slope) -to makeenvironmental assessment of certain technologicaloperations and technologies ofcrops growing in general; ensure environmental sustainability improvement of soil by increasing organic matter content and saturation of soil absorbing complex by calcium, and reducing mechanical stress on the soil of agricultural machinery by introducing the principles of conservative farming.

According to experimental data obtained in the long stationary experiment, created in Kyiv agrosoil area, improve the environmental sustainability of light loamy gray forest soils requires an integrated systems approach with a view to the simultaneous optimization of both agro-chemical and physical properties. The combination of fertilization and liming, contributing to the saturation of the soil absorbing complex of calcium and magnesium to 70-73%, increase humus content to 1,6-1,7%, the growth factor structuring of 1,35 to 1,49, indicating increased the potentialability of the soil to the formation of microstructure. Thus, the studied soil bulk density decreased from 1,48 to 1,42 g/cm3, and water permeability increased from 48,9 to 60,7 mm/h. However, regression analysis of the data shows that optimizing the equilibrium bulk density of light loamy soils should increase the humus content to 2,2-2,4%, as improved physical-chemical and agrochemical properties of topsoil without substantial transformation of organic matter content is not leads to significant and sustainable changes in their physical properties.";"Barvinskyi A.V.";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2016-05-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/7202/6987";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"7"

seven cities in West Sumatra region, Indonesia. The empirical findings are quite interesting
since the calculated optimal city size does not result in a single measure as mostly

The optimal city size measured by using the maximum profit approach would have been
larger in size compared to those measured by the minimum cost and maximum net benefit
approaches. Meanwhile, the cities measured by using the maximum net benefit have larger
size than those of the minimum cost. Unlike previous studies, the measurement of optimal
city size in this study is performed in terms of population density rather than the total
population, in order to consider the influence of land area to the optimal city size.
Moreover, by using the population density, the optimal city size becomes a relative index

The aim of this research was to analyze and monitor LUCCs in Naghadeh County, Iran over a time span of 27 years and predict the future trend of changes during the period of 2014–2041. Land use/cover (LULC) maps were extracted (as built-up regions, water body, agricultural and bare lands) for 1987, 2000 and 2014 via RS images obtained from Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI, respectively. The overall classification and Kappa index for all the classified maps were over 85% and 0.8, respectively. The C-A Markov model was used to predict future trend of LULC for the next 27-years. The obtained Kappa agreement statistics results from comparing actual and simulated maps of 2014 suggested the high capability of the model in LUCCs simulation in the study area. The results indicated the growth of built-up regions (urban area) from 1989 to 2014, while there was decrease in bare land. The projected land use for 2041 revealed more urbanization with potential expansion in agricultural and bare lands. Therefore, if the current management trends continue without any attention to sustainability measures, remnant water body and bare lands decline will ensue. This research provides useful and up-to-date information to local land use planners, managers and policy-makers to step up towards sustainable development in the study area.";"Vahid Amini Parsa

A tal fine, in questo scritto si propone una metodologia di analisi che permetta di
testare se e in quale misura i prezzi di offerta possano essere considerati una proxy per i prezzi di mercato.
In particolare modo si vuole testare se la variabilità dei prezzi di offerta possa essere un riferimento per le analisi di variabilità sul mercato immobiliare.

On the basis of the analysis of official information of agro holdings, an assessment was made of the efficiency of their activities and a conclusion was made about the optimal size of their structural subdivisions. The advantages and disadvantages of integrated structures are highlighted, peculiarities of formation of their land relations are determined. Issues of expansion of land masses of agro holdings related to the conclusion of land lease agreements are considered.

The association of separate agro-industrial enterprises of various industrial-economic orientation form an independent legal entity - a legal entity. The economic feasibility of the creation and functioning of corporate associations is objective based on obtaining the greatest effect, the essence of which is that the result of the joint corporate activities of economic structures will always be higher compared to the results of the individual work of each of them.

Corporate forms of management in agriculture were founded in Ukraine on the basis of the general theoretical model of an open, competitive, multi-faceted agricultural market economy type, aimed at an integrated world economic system. The methodology of construction involves taking into account the world economic trends and the national specificity of the country's agricultural development; it is aimed at finding rational forms of organization of agricultural production, mechanisms for overcoming crisis phenomena, stabilizing the economy and creating conditions for further qualitative and quantitative growth of the agrarian sector of the economy. For many years, leading American co-operators have been distributing concepts and concepts that are perceived and used throughout the world. This work is coordinated by the Organization for International Cooperative Development in Agriculture, and thanks to its efforts, many countries in the world have implemented projects for the development and strengthening of cooperative organizations owned by agricultural producers. The experience of cooperative and corporatization in the US agriculture can be useful for restructuring the agriculture of countries undergoing a stage of market transformation, and Ukraine has the necessary conditions for developing, along with production agricultural cooperatives, corporate and partner forms of management.

The essence of corporate structures in agriculture consists in the grouping of owners of land and property, funds of agricultural enterprises in a certain form of organization. The highest form of corporate education is considered to be those in which not individuals are integrated, but enterprises of different profile who work for the final consumer product.

The consolidation of the land masses of agricultural holdings is largely due to the advantages of integrated structures: firstly, significant savings on the scale of acquisition of means of production: second, not new conditions of collateral - agricultural products are a pledge for non-agricultural activities of holdings.

In order to improve the procedure for forming the land masses of integrated structures, it is necessary to: improve the system of state land resources management, continue to formulate the necessary legislative and normative base on issues of agrarian land use and functioning of the agricultural land market; to form an effective mechanism for the functioning of a fully-fledged, state-regulated market of agricultural land: to improve the economic mechanism of regulation of land relations.";"KUSTOVSKA О.

O direito à moradia deve ser reconhecido e protegido na esfera internacional e constitucionalmente assegurado, dado o seu posicionamento como direito fundamental na constituição brasileira. Porém, uma moradia adequada continua fazendo parte da luta diária das populações do meio rural. Assim, a pesquisa teve como objetivo elaborar um indicador que mensura o grau de conquista do direito à moradia no meio rural, a partir das especificidades colocadas pela ONU para uma moradia adequada. A formulação desse indicador foi feita através da realização de análise multivariada nos dados obtidos por meio de questionários aplicados em um assentamento de reforma agrária e em um bairro rural, ambos localizados no estado de São Paulo. Para complementar e auxiliar na compreensão desses resultados, entrevistas foram realizadas com famílias identificadas durante a aplicação dos questionários. Os fatores de saída da análise mostraram-se consistentes e representativos das realidades encontradas, possibilitando refletir sobre os principais problemas existentes para que a população rural alcance o direito à moradia adequada.

Abstract 

The housing right must be recognized and protected at the international level and constitutionally guaranteed due to be a fundamental right in the Brazilian constitution. However, an adequate housing remains part of the daily struggle of the rural population. Therewith, this research aimed to develop an indicator that measures the achievement of the housing right in rural areas, from the specifics raised by the UN to an adequate housing. The formulation of this indicator has been performed by multivariate analysis on data obtained from questionnaires applied in a land reform settlement as well as in a rural district, both in São Paulo state. Also to complement and assist in understanding these results, interviews have been conducted with families identified during the questionnaires. The output factors were consistent and representative of the realities, enabling to reflect on the main problems for the rural population to reach the right to adequate housing.

In general, we can distinguish four types of regions, formed to implement the tasks under different direction: a) homogeneous regions (formed on the basis of common characteristics – mountain region, economically developed / underdeveloped region and so on.). b) functional regions (formed by determining the basic type of economic activity – touristic region, agricultural region, etc.). c) administrative regions (formed by pre-defined criteria for performing administrative functions in a particular area – district, local council, etc.). d) personal perception regions (based on personal values – Homeland and so on.). The focus of this publication focuses on the study of rural regions.

As a result of studies is found that the population of Ukraine decreased by about 7 million Inhabitants. In 1993 there was 52.2 million of people, and in 2016 dropped to 42.7 million (temporary occupied territories excluded). Determined that the most influential factors are the degradation of rural region’s economic and demographic crisis (can be both a cause and consequence of each other). In this regard, the worsening of demographic situation is the biggest problem, because without human resources economic growth can’t be achieved.

For more profound understanding of the problem we used the spiral of negative developed of communities/regions proposed by Austrian scientists G. Weber and T. Fisher. It indicates the relationship between adverse events and their sequence. This choice is not accidental, because the spiral indicates that this is a progressive movement that eventually accelerated and the difficulty of stopping the negative processes increases not arithmetically but geometrically.

Therefore, developing regional programs of rural development moderators (selected and trained specialists who work in the region) cooperate with the heads of communities and local residents. Thus, they try to form a regional identity, create the region’s brand, develop a regional strategy, promote regional products both within the region and outside, try to make the region attractive for tourist.

It is determined that monopolized agricultural production is a significant constraint for the development of rural areas in Ukraine. It is difficult to rely on the development of the community in which most of agricultural lands are used by huge agricultural holdings, which displace locals from the region. Moreover, the government policy in the agricultural sector contributes fully to them and that is disastrous for the state in the long term. For comparison, the average area of agricultural enterprise in Austria is approximately 43 hectares and added value in the region is much higher than in Ukraine.

For more effective rural development it is proposed to develop a long-term national development strategy for depressive territories, because preservation of the existing state monopolization strategy will provoke even greater demographic crisis.

It is as well necessary to eliminate the corruption risks that are present in all programs financed by public funds. In this regard, it is important that those who make decisions about the allocation of funds were not linked with the beneficiary regions and specific applicants.";"Dorosh A.";"";"National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2017-05-31";"en;ru;uk";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"UKR;AUT";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/article/view/9037/8306";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-SA";"http://journals.nubip.edu.ua/index.php/Zemleustriy/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";"8"

At Haliç land and sea merge: the natural harbour of ancient Constantinople, home to the naval arsenal and place of delights, it saw its natural and urban state change completely in the final phases of the Ottoman Empire. Its recent history has been marked by a process of intense industrialization, developing uncontrollably on its banks between the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Its importance as a production centre -the country’s most important industrial area – grew in time in parallel with pollution levels in the surrounding environment. The climax of this process of transformation took place in the first decades after World War II when, due to heavy industrial pollution and the saturation of coastal spaces, Haliç became the productive heart but also the most run-down and densely populated urban area of the city. The history of the subsequent redevelopment of Haliç is fairly well known, having been the subject of numerous essays describing its socio-economic, cultural and political development. Less attention, despite the many publications on the subject, has been devoted to the analysis of this extensive process of de-industrialization and renewal from the point of view of architectural and urban design. The purpose of this essay is to contribute to the debate from this point of view, briefly reconstructing the major changes taking place in the urban landscape and updating the overview of critical reflection on the current urban situation, analyzed through some of the most important interventions carried out in recent years and the changes they induced.</p>";"Gianluca Frediani";"";"Centro di Ateneo per le Biblioteche dell'Università di Napoli Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-01-31";"en;es;fr;it";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"150";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/2281-4574/2022";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tria.unina.it/index.php/tria/about/submissions";"13"

Actually because of the economic and financial budget crisis the same Office cut all the national funds at least in the short run till the year 2013. At the same time EU deleted the project from TEN (Trans European Network) agenda. Despite of national government statements, the real destiny of the program is very uncertain. Even because critical studies and assessments strongly increased in the latest years. The essay recalls the history of the project: the first idea was born sat the beginning of Italian national State unity after 1861, but the Myth of rejoining Sicily and continental Italy became an achievable program only after second world war. In 1971 the State issued a national Act for promoting the agenda and the Agency in charge of projecting and building the Messina Strait Bridge. In 1981 the agency was completely organized and named as “Stretto di Messina” Society, that later became “Stretto di Messina Ltd”. Several project proposals were advanced by engineers and corporations: eventually through an international technical selection the general shape of the bridge was designed. Over time the strong decrease of land traffic toward Sicily in front of dramatic increase of air passenger travels and sea good flows made the project of the bridge almost useless. Indeed at the middle of 1980’s the Italian government was writing the project off. But the never ending story went on. Actually in the recent years, the right parties government reset the Big Works Growth Policies and issued the a national act for promoting and accelerating operations among which the Messina Strait Bridge Program was considered one of the most important.. So, in 1992 the first edition of Preliminary Project was introduced: strong critics pushed the Agency to retire and fix the project production: because of that, there was a long debate that ended in 2002 with the new shape of the preliminary project. The final version of the preliminary project was defined in 2005, after further observations and critics by scientists, scholars, environmentalists and overall technicians offices of the several involved Italian Ministers. Today, at the end of 2011 the definitive not-operative project has been finally introduced. The article emphasizes the environmental and territorial impacts of the project and also it underlines its weakness in terms of economics, transportation and land planning, by asking the meaning of building a mega infrastructure for land linkages between Europe and Sicily today, in the age of beautiful landscape and hi-tech.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Il governo ha ribadito la volontà di proseguire con il progetto del ponte sullo Stretto di Messina, all'interno del quadro di investimenti tesi ad accele­rare la ripresa economica; ha tuttavia azzerato le risorse disponibili per l’operazione, tradendo forse la vera natura dell’enunciazione suddetta: quella della reiterazione-sempre piùstanca e senza convinzione- di una declaratoria ormai rituale quanto improbabile.

of humankind, and secure the basics and quality of life. Because these ecosystems are still undergoing fundamental changes,
the interest of the society is to know more about future developments and their ecological impacts. To describe and analyze
these changes, scenarios can be developed and an assessment of the ecological changes can be carried out subsequently. In the
project „Landscape Saxony 2050“; a methodology for the construction of exploratory scenarios was worked out. The presented
methodology provides a possibility to identify the driving forces (socio-cultural, economic and ecological conditions) of the
landscape development. It allows to indicate possible future paths which lead to a change of structures and processes in the
landscape and can influence the capability to provide ecosystem services. One essential component of the applied technique is
that an approach for the assessment of the effects of the landscape changes on ecosystem services is integrated into the developed
scenario methodology. Another is, that the methodology is strong designed as participatory, i.e. stakeholders are integrated
actively. The method is a seven phase model which provides the option for the integration of the stakeholders‘ participation at all
levels of scenario development. The scenario framework was applied to the district of Görlitz, an area of 2100 sq km located at
the eastern border of Germany. The region is affected by strong demographic as well as economic changes. The core issue focused
on the examination of landscape change in terms of biodiversity. Together with stakeholders, a trend scenario and two alternative
scenarios were developed. The changes of the landscape structure are represented in story lines, maps and tables.
On basis of the driving forces of the issue areas „cultural / social values“ and „political control“, three scenarios were developed
up to the time horizons in 2030 and 2050. They are titled „Trend“, „Tradition and Ecology“ and „Technology and Energy“. These
scenarios differ markedly in the degree of the future lignite exploitation, in the use of renewable energy and in the environmental
compatibility of the agricultural production.
In total, the investigation shows that the integration of the ecosystem services approach into the scenario technology has brought
new aspects. However, the procedure became more complex.
For the development of the scenarios a precise definition of the driving forces turned out to be essential. The experiences of the
project further show that only two or at most three key driving forces (KDF) can be distinguished really sensibly or can be looked
at in their interactions.
It could be shown that from these results itself concrete measures can be derived which support desirable developments or
counteract against undesirable effects. By the integration of stakeholders in different working steps, the scenarios can contribute
to the sensitization and better perception of future problems and chances of a region.";"Matthias Rosenberg

Viene utilizzato il metodo dei prezzi edonici (hedonic price method, acronimo inglese HPM - ndt), che si fonda sull'idea che un prodotto è caratterizzato dalle sue proprietà costitutive e che il valore di un bene può essere calcolato sommando i valori stimati delle sue singole proprietà. Sulla base di questo assunto, l’HPM fornisce una base per stimare i prezzi delle case tenendo conto delle caratteristiche strutturali di un'unità abitativa.
D'altra parte, secondo il modello della città monocentrica, la variabile principale che determina le variazioni nei prezzi delle abitazioni all'interno di un'area metropolitana, ipotizzando un livello di qualità costante, è il prezzo del terreno e ciò suggerisce, quindi, che anche la distanza dal centro città (central business
district, acronimo inglese CBD - ndt) dovrebbe essere inclusa nel modello di determinazione dei prezzi delle abitazioni. Inoltre, la letteratura riferita alla dinamica temporale dei prezzi delle abitazioni giustifica l’inserimento di una variabile temporale tra i fattori determinanti del prezzo di una casa.
L'inclusione della dimensione temporale permette di includere le dinamiche temporali del mercato, come la volatilità o la ciclicità dei prezzi.
Solitamente, la maggior parte delle analisi precedenti dei prezzi delle abitazioni non teneva conto congiuntamente delle dimensioni strutturali, spaziali e temporali; di conseguenza, le stime prodotte potevano essere distorte. Il modello composito, qui suggerito, rifletterà le dimensioni temporali e spaziali, oltre a riflettere la qualità, rappresentata dalle sue caratteristiche intrinseche, di un'abitazione.";"Shanaka Herath

The urban sprawl of settlements in Italy, and also in Europe, is quite different from sprawl phenomenon and suburbs basically referring to American cities. Urban sprawl is characterized by one-family houses, dispersed in the countryside and by large industrial enclaves close to infrastructures networks. Italian situation can be interpreted as a peri-urban model instead of sprawl condition. The rural-urban fringe derives from the erosion of the countryside due to the abandoned residential settlements and the industrial patterns.  In the contemporary Italian urbanized landscape, urban and rural realms merge, creating complex “hybrid” types of space, consisting of residential areas, commercial zones, agricultural land, recreational and nature areas. The rural-urban fringe, an area between the city and the countryside, is characterised by spatial and functional heterogeneity and by a large amount of drosscapes, “in between spaces”, abandoned industrial buildings and sites and underused spaces without development programs. This article addressed three main questions: Are there alternatives to closure and abandonment? Is it possible to consider the recycling of drosscapes as a new paradigm in opposition to the crisis of international finances and city models? Can the networking of residual rural-scape represent the new strategy to regenerate urbanized landscape?";"Enrico Formato

Today become particularly acute the problem for efficient use of urban land use, including land for industrial facilities non-functioning as a reserve future development of Kyiv-based ecological-economic approach to solving them.

However, to ensure sustainable development of urban population (preserve and improve health, improve working conditions, improve living conditions, increase the construction of social and affordable housing, reducing unemployment, creating new jobs, improving the ecological state of the environment) within large cities , you need to identify ways to optimize existing urban land use.

The complexity of management decisions is determined, above all, the fact that in most cities of Ukraine territorial resources are exhausted and vacant land plots require significant investment. Also, a significant proportion of non-functioning industrial enterprises, which occupy large areas in the city were in Kyiv surrounded by residential development, buffer zones, technogenic disturbed and contaminated land. These objects be removed outside the settlements and the land on which they are to be re-cultivated and restoration for more ecological, economically feasible and sustainable use.

The rapid development of large cities around the world and increase their impact on the environment and society is accompanied by a set ekonominyh, environmental and social issues that significantly influence the development of land relations in settlements in general.

Today in Kyiv observed the changing dynamics of land area, which is to reduce the share of agricultural and forestry purposes and to increase the territory of other categories.

The process of de-industrialization and suburbanization of urban land use is inevitable. They in turn accelerate other processes - ""crowding out"" of industrial facilities in the cities suburbs, which in turn will foster a number of ecological, economic and social problems.

Management processes of territorial development of the city can be successful only when decisions on current issues of land use based on strategic, long-term development programs, offensive planning ideas zemleohoronnyh ensure consistency of implementation measures.

Optimization of territorial development. Kyiv is to improve the structure of the land to improve the efficiency and usage of urban land, improvement of investment attractiveness, increase their profitability, ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems city.

In our belief improving ecological and economic situation of the city, forming an effective urban land may provide by moving industrial facilities beyond Kyiv, to reorganize these areas of balance and formation of the optimal structure of urban land.

Given the shortage of available areas for further development of the city's new housing construction, facilities service sector, tourism, etc. Industrial areas in which rolled production function, should be seen as a spatial basis optimize land use in Kiev.

Taking into account the economic, social and environmental factors optimizing industrial areas are not functioning businesses that occupy large areas of urban land should also consider the most expedient type of land use.

This, in turn, will contribute to the growth of urban land use, improve the well-being of the urban population, increasing tax revenues to the city budget, city economic development and is a prerequisite for creating favorable conditions for attracting investments.";"Tsviakh О.

This was largely fuelled by the credit conditions and a general fear of the future. A strong negative correlation between initial price level and its increase leads to a massive trend of spatial homogenization of the prices. Such a tendency is fairly vigorous in the metropolitan area of Marseille, and particularly in its extremely poor and long devaluated centre, where prices have risen by over 200% since the mid-1990s. This real estate market evolution is emblematic of Neil Smith’s rent gap hypothesis. Yet, a detailed survey of spatial differentials of price increase shows that contiguous central neighbourhoods with similar price levels before the recent tremendous upsurge are affected by appreciably different price rises. Therefore, this unequal price evolution cannot be understood without a clearer analysis on the ‘potential land value’ than provided by Smith’s model. In the context of such housing price increase and uncertainty, prices transmit noisy signals to investors. Thus, State involvement, as in one of the most important operations of urban redevelopment nationwide (Euroméditerranée), appears as a guarantee for investors and also accounts for the spatial differentials of price growth rates.";"Guilhem Boulay";"";"Articulo – Journal of Urban Research";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2012-11-30";"en;fr";"urban population";"Urban Tenure";"";"FRA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/articulo.2152";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC-ND";"https://articulo.revues.org/2860";""

We conclude that: a) from a theoretical viewpoint, ecosystem and landscape ecology differ since they deal with ecological topics having very different spatial and temporal scales, b) from a practical standpoint, they deal with dissimilar purposes emerging both from unlike research scales and different approaches, as the interest of landscape ecology is mainly focused on the whole ecological mosaic rather than on single components, in this view assuming an “horizontal” ecological perspective, c) transdisciplinarity is still a work in progress in landscape ecology, d) several research purposes in landscape ecology are far from being reached, e) a bridge lacks between the “horizontal” perspective adopted from landscape ecology and the “vertical” approach distinctive of ecosystem ecology, therefore, they actually behave as detached disciplines.

Urban sprawl refers to the extent of urbanization, which is a global phenomenon mainly driven by population growth and large scale migration. In developing countries like Iran, urban sprawl is taking its toll on the natural resources at an alarming pace. The purpose of this paper is to study urban growth and effective factors on them in the city of Urmia, Iran. We used quantitive data of the study area from the period between 1989 and 2007, and population censuses of Urmia. To measure the model of urban growth, Holderness and Shannon’s entropy were employed. The Urmia case is interesting for several reasons: first, it is a case of very fast urban growth even for a developing country; second, it illustrates how the fastest rates of urban sprawl may correspond to middle size cities rather than to large centers. Third, it portrays a land substitution process in which agricultural land is not the primary provider of urban land which is relatively rare in urban contexts, and fourth, it also illustrates how urban sprawl may also hide important internal land uses such as the presence of agricultural plots within urban boundaries.";"Jamal MOHAMMADI

By use of megafossil tree remains, preserved exposed on the ground surface, treeline shift over the past millennium was investigated at multiple sites along the Scandes in northern Sweden. Difference in thermal level between the present and the Medieval period, about AD 1000-1200, is a central, although controversial, aspect concerning the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate warming. Radiocarbon-dated megafossil pines revealed that the treeline was consistently positioned as much as 115 m higher during the Medieval period than today (AD 2000-2010), after a century of warming and substantial treeline upshift. Drawing on the last-mentioned figure, and a lapse rate of 0.6 °C/100 m, it may be inferred that Medieval summer temperatures were about 0.7 °C warmer than much of the past 100 years. Extensive pine mortality and treeline descent after the Medieval warming peak reflect substantially depressed temperatures during the Little Ice Age. Warmer-than-present conditions during the Medieval period concur with temperature reconstructions from different parts of northern Fennoscandia, northwestern Russia and Greenland. Modern warming has not been sufficient to restore Medieval treelines.

The case study of Torre Annunziata, in the gulf of Naples";"";"This article starts from the study of the historic port cities, that today are facing the challenge of the urban waterfront requalification, through the preservation of the cultural and landscape heritage.
The recommendations on the “Historic Urban Landscape”, and the operating tools promoted by the ICOMOS “Guidance on Heritage Impact Assessments for Cultural World Heritage Properties” of 2011, configure themselves as the most recent dispositions regarding the preservation, protection and enhancement of the cultural heritage (Fusco Girard, 2010). The ICOMOS Guide it was considered the most suitable tool for evaluating the impacts of the big requalification project of the urban waterfront on the cultural heritage. To fully understand this tool it was made an application for evaluating the impacts of Pompeii Great Project on the waterfront of Torre Annunziata, a coastal city in the Gulf of Naples, UNESCO Site. After this analysis phase it follows a reflection on how to improve the Heritage Impact Assessment as a tool able to evaluate not only the cultural impacts, but also the economic ones, so we can speak of “economy of the cultural heritage”. The last proposal is that of supporting the process of “Heritage Impact Assessment” with an evaluation of economic impacts, through an analysis of costs/benefits, for estimating in a monetary terms, the benefit of the investments into the preservation of the historic urban heritage of the coastal cities, proposing an “Economic Heritage Impact Assessment” (EHIA). This method was elaborated from the author, into the PHD thesis “The Historic Urban Landscape of the coastal cities: challenges and opportunities”. The case of Torre Annunziata offers the possibility to overcome the mere evaluation of the cultural impacts proposed by the ICOMOS.";"Mariarosaria Angrisano";"";"Agenzia delle Entrate Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze;Territorio Italia";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2015-06-30";"it";"cadastres;land cover mapping";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.14609/Ti_2_15_5e";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY-NC";"http://www.territorioitalia.agenziaentrate.it";"23"

Current and future inequity condition of Italian Property Taxation";"";"<p>The main purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare the current local tax on real estate and the future and assessing criticality. The tax base is calculated by applying calculation methods that differ depending on the type of property you must tax. For buildings used for residential, the tax base is calculated on the basis of the cadastral income; in the case of building land is rather used the market value of land and buildings and, for rent, rural manor. The land property values are always lower than market values, which is because some time trying to implement a revision of the class with the objective of bringing the two values. The reclass procedure has recently been adopted in the municipality of Milano where it was decided to reclass of buildings located within a few micro-climates for the most central, in which houses were originally built affordable housing to meet the housing needs of the social classes poor and that over time turned into mansions in the city center. From 1 January 2012, the Imu will come into force, only municipal tax, which replaces the current Ici; the two taxes differ in the higher fixed rate (7.6 ‰), which does not involve substantial modifications to the old system tax. In this way, the result will be to produce an increase in the tax burden without solving the inequalities of the old system but increasing the gap. The Implementation Act contains provisions which IMU when applied to allow municipalities to solve some problems present in the Ici.</p>";"Michele Argiolas

The need for future cities arises because of the rapid growth in population and thereby causing a decline in the living standards. In the United States itself, many people are moving to cities every day. Today cities are getting crowded and if the influx continues at the same rate, current cities will become unmanageable and unlivable.
More population means faster consumption of natural resources which eventually leads to ecological imbalance. Already more than 80% of world׳s forests are gone. The food consumption has also doubled over the last fifty years and this has exerted pressure on the landscape through the use of artificial fertilizers. The use of artificial agents to boost agricultural productivity has significantly marred the flora and fauna leading to loss of a huge amount of bio diversity.
Another problem with the increasing population and population migration to cities is the rise of congestion on the city roads. In the United States a person drives 7500 miles in 1600 h with an a average speed of 4.68 mph. To accommodate the population approximately 2000 trees are cut in a minute in the Amazon alone.
On top of all that, with increasing wealth the average house size has almost doubled since 1970 and this has further caused the decline of arable land and forests. To deal with the problem of rising population and congestion within the cities, we need to plan cities of the future that will be able to utilize the available resources in a more efficient and cleaner manner. The future city project aims to delve into details of various future city models and aims to find out which model will be best suitable depending upon the strategic criteria that we have used to evaluate the various merits of the BOCR model.
The four alternative kinds of cities are analyzed below according to their merits. They are A. Compact City, B. Elevated City, C. Green House City, and D. Water City.";"Thomas L. Saaty

Contrariamente a quanto è capitato fino ad ora, il legislatore ha deciso di non replicare il modello classico strutturato in Codice e Regolamento attuativo. La scelta si è orientata nei confronti della cosiddetta soft law che non prevede più un Regolamento ma una serie di rimandi a successivi Decreti attuativi e/o Linee guida. Oltre al dibattuto tema del carattere normativamente cogente di una Linea guida, tradizionalmente associata a strumenti di natura volontaristica e di indirizzo, ci si chiede se questa scelta sia da premiare per l’innovazione apportata o se vada riconsiderata in funzione delle criticità riscontrate dall’aprile 2016 ad oggi, che hanno generato già più di un centinaio di modifiche e integrazioni, spesso anche attraverso leggi e/o decreti che nulla hanno a che fare con il Codice dei Contratti. Trascurando gli aspetti più formali, per effetto del Nuovo Codice e del suo primo correttivo, il recentissimo D.Lgs 56/2017, sono molti i temi di natura tecnica che generano perplessità e posizioni contrapposte: la nuova articolazione dei livelli di progettazione, l’eliminazione (almeno formale) degli studi di fattibilità, la diffusione del criterio dell’offerta economicamente più vantaggiosa e la qualificazione di stazioni appaltanti e operatori economici in base a rating di legalità e di impresa.";"Francesco Prizzon

Project of Viserba’s waterfront";"";"<p>Nowadays many seaside towns, economically based on marine tourism, need operations to reinvent and recovery their own image and to define a new strategy of urban development. The presence of the sea is of primary importance and it should be considered not only as an economic resource, but mainly as a strong element of identity that must interact with the urban landscape.<br />The project of Viserba’s waterfront faces these issues and it tries to answer them through a unique urban plan. The renewal of the area comes through the replacement of large parts of urban fabric, characterized by the high density of construction and by a low architectural quality. The aim of the urban regeneration process of the Viserba’s seafront is to recreate the connection between the city and its marine environment and try to keep the whole urban system in balance from architectural, cultural, economic and social viewpoints. The main concept of the project is based on the theme of water that generates the idea of a waterfront with new tourist facilities oriented toward the sea and that becomes the common thread that links them together. The cohesiveness between sea and land takes place through the inclusion of a promenade, which links the beach with the built environment, and through the recovery of the historic port that becomes a focal point. Moreover, the strengthening of this unbreakable bond is stressed by the new skyline, by the residences that are inclined towards the sea, by the redevelopment of the town centre, based on a system of connected squares with the promenade and the sea, and by the building of a spa, which is opening onto the beach. The spa commemorates the origins of Viserba, once called “Queen of the Waters”.</p>";"Luca Morgagni

Cooling Effect towards Urban Planning in South American Cities";"";"Open space (OS) is a key element in the provision of ecosystem services (ES) in urban environments. Under a land cover-land use perspective, cities are incorporating into the expansion process to different types of surfaces: sealed, paved surfaces and OS. The first corresponds to a land cover change while the second, which includes bare soil, grass, forest or any other type of non-sealed surface, corresponds to a land use change, without physical transformations. As a land use change OS is able to keep fundamental pre-existing ecological properties. However, besides specific ecological characteristics, the overall capacity to provide ES depends also on the size, number and spatial distribution of OSs within the urban fabric. Those aspects which can determine the very ecological performance of urban ecosystem services (UES) are not yet included in the current urban planning in Latin America. OS is still understood mainly as green infrastructure and related mostly with aesthetic and cultural benefits. On the contrary, under an ecological point of view, OS is capable to provide fundamental UES, which can be spatially assessed and analyzed. In this paper the provision of cooling services (CS) is assessed in 2 South American cities: Lima and Santiago de Chile. The provision of CS is measured by means of a Remote Sensing-GIS-based method. Two aspects of CS are explored: (1) the current amount of existing OS; and (2) the trend of increasing/reducing CS within the urban tissue, in a dynamic assessment of spatial distribution and rates of OS incorporation to the continuous urban tissue. The aim is to analyze the CS generated by OS in those two cities. The analysis discusses the role of OS in the provision of CS, considering the current urban development trends and planning practice in these specific Latin American cities, highlighting the need to keep unsealed surfaces and increase in trees coverage, to retain the CS provision in certain levels.";"Luis Inostroza";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2014-05-31";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"013;CHL;005";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/2541";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";""

a method including landscape metrics was developed and applied to assess and to compare different land
use scenarios with regard to flood prevention and nature conservation. For the analysis, two sub-catchments strongly
differing in land use within the Weisseritz catchment (Eastern Erzgebirge, Saxony, Germany) were selected. The
first step of the evaluation procedure was a biotope assessment using three assessment criteria (naturalness, substitutability,
rareness / endangerment). However, the biotope assessment did not yield any information about spatial
distribution or the structural composition of the landscape. Therefore, landscape metrics were applied to analyse the
structural and biotope type diversity at the landscape scale. Different landscape metrics (Shannon/Weaver diversity
index, mean patch size index, Interdispersion/Juxtaposition index) and a weighting system were used to compare the
different land use scenarios and the current state. The analysed catchment areas differ substantially in terms of their
current state and potential measures regarding flood prevention and nature conservation depending on the location
and distribution of biotope types. It was demonstrated that this method can be used for small catchment areas regardless
of their land use for assessing, analysing and comparing different land use scenarios for a specific area.";"S. Bianchin

Se estimó para ello un modelo de precios hedónicos que incluye en su formulación ciertos atributos espaciales de la casa, tales como el número de vecinos en un radio determinado. Estas variables fueron calculadas por medio de un Sistema de Información Geográfica (SIG). También se analizaron otros factores incluidos tradicionalmente en estos modelos, como las características estructurales de la casa y la distancia a lugares de interés. Se aplicaron técnicas de econometría espacial para contrastar la existencia de autocorrelación espacial en los precios. En general, los resultados indican que el alejamiento de la casa incrementa el precio de alquiler. Estos resultados pueden ser útiles en el debate entre los gestores políticos y también la población local sobre el desarrollo futuro de esta incipiente industria.  ABSTRACT This paper analyses the influence of some spatial characteristics in the rental prices of rural houses in Gran Canaria. To do this, a hedonic prices model was estimated, which includes certain spatial attributes of the house in its formulation, such as the land use and the number of neighbours in a given radius around the house. The variables were estimated by means of a Geographic Information System (GIS). Other factors traditionally included in hedonic models are also analysed, such as the structural characteristics of the house and distance to some amenities. Spatial econometrics was applied to check the spatial autocorrelation of rental prices. In general, results point out that remoteness increases the rental price of rural houses. These findings may be useful in the debate among policy makers and also local population on the future development of the nowadays incipient industry.";"Hernández Guerra, Juan María

represented in the plain using digital elevation models in the 1-m grid (DEM1). The scale of the erosion process
models and the elevation models is comparable. With it instruments are available to improve the erosion simulation.
Simulations, based on (R)USLE family and bigger grid width, are relevant for regional overviews, to the clarification

The cross-slope tillage has intensified the water erosion in the examined case with special area morphology. From
historical sources furrows of the ridge and furrow system were identified as runoff ways.

A result of a normative or profitability plan?. / La forma urbana en la periferia del área metropolitana de Santiago. ¿La consecuencia de una normativa o plan de rentabilidad?";"";"Metropolitan Santiago is one of the many Latin American cities which has been developed according to a spread model of urbanisation. This pattern has caused at least two types of consequences: economic and physical ones. The former is shown in the speculation of land value at the rural fringe of the metropolitan area which has low prices, these have suddenly increased after the normative changes in the land use, from rural to urban. The later shows location of massive low-income housing and commercial malls regardless connection to the urban fabric and spatial shaping of the existing city. This results in a chaotic urban form resembling a ""patchwork"".This paper reviews the scope of a Chilean policy instrument called ""Plan Regulador"" used to control physical urban growth, particularly sprawled on the fringe of the city. It is believed that as a consequence of this Plan, normative procedures are not good enough for achieving its objectives. Conversely, urban form appears to be a result of a profitability plan made by private developers. Given the weakness of this instrument, some recommendations related to spatial models are suggested to incorporate to or complement the ""Plan Regulador""./ El Plan Regulador Comunal es el instrumento normativo de planeación urbanística chilena, cuya formulación pretende regular en el ámbito comunal básicamente los siguientes aspectos: los usos de suelo, las condiciones de edificación y subdivisión del suelo, la red vial estructurante y los limites urbanos.Se cree que este instrumento es imperfecto toda vez que no incorpora en la normativa una dimensión clave del urbanismo: la morfología urbana, entendida como el sistema espacial tridimensional de la ciudad. Por el contrario, el análisis empírico demuestra que factores como la forma urbana son respuestas del libre juego de fuerzas económicas y sociales modeladoras del espacio. En consecuencia, lo que domina es un patrón de urbanización en vez de un proyecto de urbanismo; las cuales son modalidades muy distintas de hacer ciudad.Este articulo pretende demostrar que la forma urbana, derivada de la aplicación del instrumento normativo en una comuna perimetral metropolitana como es Maipú, es uno de los impactos no previstos por el Plan Regulador, pero que podría incorporarse en un nuevo instrumento de planificación urbana./";"Mawromatis, Constantino

The market is still not perfect and has all the inherent problems connected to estimation of the compensation due for expropriation. In general, the latter doesn’t compensate the expropriated party sufficiently for the impact that the construction of a new infra-structure can have on the land in question. The result is that the expropriated party not only loses possession of their own estate, but also receives nothing in recognition of its <em>plus/minus</em> value compared to the non-expropriated party. The effect on the land market created by the expropriation procedure itself is not factored into the estimated compensation. </span>Another question is the standardization of the method used to determine  the additional compensation due, calculated by means of the Vam, which does not make provisions for the instance of a farming company headed by an entrepreneur with above-average business skill, nor does it consider  the agricultural and  pedoclimatic quality. Lastly, the drafting of a new system for calculating compensation for expropriation is deemed as necessary, one that would incorporate the <em>quid</em> of the land productivity factor within the business initiative “infra-structure for public use”.</p>";"Marcellina Bertolinelli

This paper aims to investigate the patterns of design and architecture in Persian gardens and the meanings intertwined with their patterns and significant elements such as water and trees. Persian gardens are not only about geometries and shapes; but also manifest different design elements, each representing a specific symbol and its significance among the society. This paper seeks to explore Persian gardens in terms of their geometric structure, irrigation system, network construction and pavilions alongside design qualities such as hierarchy, symmetry, centrality, rhythm and harmony.

"DOAJ:84e237749d634be7a86e570c562a7401";"COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EFFICIENCY FUNCTIONING OF THE CONTROLLER-MELIORATIVE ORGANIZATION OF THE TERRITORY IN UKRAINE AND THE USA";"";"In order to create an optimal land use model and reduce the impact of erosion on agricultural land, a number of land conservation measures need to be introduced. The most effective set of measures that minimizes the manifestation of water erosion in erosion-hazardous areas is the contouring-reclamation organization of the territory. This complex of activities combines a protective reclamation structure that interacts with the terrain and soil protection technology of growing crops.

In general, at the end of the 1980s, projects of contouring-reclamation organization of the territory were developed for sites that had a negative erosion effect throughout the territory of Ukraine. However, with the beginning of the 1990s, the practical implementation of measures to restructure the territory was suspended due to political transformations and lack of funds.

In practice, one of the most striking examples of the implementation of design decisions is the territory of Lisnosankivsky village council of the Kupyansk district, whose Kharkiv territory is characterized by significant manifestations of erosion. For three decades, the staff of the soil protection laboratory conducted experiments on these sites. The possibility of achieving sustainable ecological indicators of soil erosion at field crop rotation -1.8 t / ha and soil protection crop rotation -1.5 t / ha was established.

Similar objects that were implemented and implemented in the Kupyansk district of the Kharkiv region, were partially implemented on other erosion-hazardous sites in Polissya, Forest-steppe and Steppe regions of Ukraine. Today, most of these activities have exhausted their laid-out exploitation resources, some of the protected areas were destroyed as a result of the lack of state control, constant change of owners and the lack of motivation of actual land users.

The negative manifestation of water erosion on arable land is characteristic not only for the territory of Ukraine. This process is widespread in different countries where the soil, relief and climatic conditions have similar characteristics of water erosion.

One of the most successful foreign experience in minimizing the effects of water erosion, under similar conditions, on agricultural land is realized in the United States of America. Since the 1970s, agricultural producers (farmers) have attracted erosion-hazardous areas to cultivate and have grown crops that are in high demand on the market. Such activities have led to negative consequences. The biggest erosion problem in the early 1980s was the state of Missouri. The state of the state has a wide range of soils and terrain, which is characterized by the characteristics of water erosion and the development of a subtropical network.

To stop, minimize the effects of water erosion in the United States began research and implementation of soil protection measures. In 1985, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was approved. The purpose of this program was to withdraw from the cultivation of erosion-hazardous areas for 10-15 years, the development and implementation of contour-melioration organization of the territory. The funding for the CRP program was supposed by the tax on land sales. The result of this program for 30 years is the preservation of 9 billion tons of fertile soil from erosion, as well as reduced flushing of mineral fertilizers by 85%.

The best results for soil conservation and minimization of the effects of water erosion across the state were achieved in Missouri. The soil washed in 2007 from 1 acre (0,405 hectares) and amounted to 4.2 tons and 5.3 tons for cultivating crops. That is, almost twice in 25 years. Approximate structure of the land fund was 1/3 of arable land, 1/3 of pasture and hayfields, and 1/3 of forest lands. This structure was achieved through the reservation of agricultural land.

Domestic and foreign experience of the embodiment of contour-reclamation organization of the territory in areas with manifestation of erosion processes, testifies to the possibility of using them under arable land. However, these sites will require constant monitoring and restrictions on use.

It has been practically confirmed that the key measure in the preserved soils from water erosion, in the presence of contour-land reclamation organization of the territory, will depend on the correct economic activity of the actual land user.

Repeated introduction into active cultivation of erosion sites will adversely affect soil fertility and crop yield. Elimination of the consequences caused by erosion on agricultural land will not be comparable to the profits gained from cultivating crops.";"Butenko E.

Lo sfruttamento intelligente dei dati digitali può portare a uno sviluppo conoscitivo ma anche a un profitto, le cui soglie di sfruttamento possono essere misurate in un sistema economico. Nell’irreversibile fenomeno di crescita dei dati digitali, la disciplina del “Data Visualization” diventa cruciale per accedere e comprendere informazioni complesse. Few, guru della comunicazione visiva, scrive che “scopriamo il mondo attraverso gli occhi”; le forme di comunicazione e interpretazione tradizionali dei dati hanno puntato sulla dimensione visuale per migliorare la comprensione e hanno permesso sia agli analisti sia agli utenti la
sperimentazione di nuove interazioni (“story-telling”).
Come urbanisti e cittadini, ci affidiamo alla vista che gestisce molti dei sensori (70%) legati alla percezione, alle mappe cognitive, agli errori e ai nuovi pensieri. L’ipotesi di fondo di questo articolo vuole generare delle riflessioni sui Big Data come strategia importante per le imprese pubbliche e private che intendono
imparare a cambiare dalle informazioni digitali di cui oggi disponiamo. Attraverso l’uso di uno strumento analitico di visualizzazione dei dati informativi, si descrive un recente caso di studio in un contesto territoriale come quello dei nuovi consorzi amministrativi (Unione dei Comuni NordEst Torino).

La determinazione del coefficiente ambientale ha fornito ai proprietari degli immobili uno strumento credibile e obiettivo per comunicare ai potenziali inquilini le qualità ambientali dell’immobile che sarebbero interessati a prendere in affitto, iniziando così a rivedere le loro aspettative soffermandosi maggiormente su obiettivi più complessi in termini di rendimento, oltre che sui vantaggi derivanti dall’applicazione di una prassi tipica. Da più di vent’anni, la determinazione del coefficiente ambientale è confluita in un’area di studio e ricerca più che legittima.

Mobility plans consider all modes of transport planned towards a sustainable urban development. The measures implemented are a mixture of material and immaterial interventions with the aim to reach a better traffic environment with reduced traffic volumes and emissions, increased accessibility and safety and an increased quality of life for all citizens. In Italy, according to the principle that the mobility strategies cannot be separated from the land use planning, many cities are developing innovative Mobility Plans that are integrated with urban planning actions. In order to underline these best practices, a comparative study is proposed between five different urban areas in the central and northern Italy. Most innovative plans have within their strategies the following points: &ndash; Promote integrated policies to deal with the complexity of urban transport systems, governance issues and the necessary coherence between different policies, for example between urban mobility and cohesion policy, environment policy or health policy. &ndash; Help to green urban transport by introducing new, clean vehicle technologies and alternative fuels and promoting smart charging to encourage transport users to change travel behavior. &ndash; Support sharing experience and knowledge to enable better access to this information and help stakeholders to capitalize on these experiences and on relevant data and statistics. &ndash; Optimize urban mobility to encourage effective integration, interoperability and interconnection between different transport networks. &ndash; Improve road safety to achieve a high level of road safety, especially for vulnerable road users such as young people and the elderly. However only some plans have specific actions towards a real urbanmobility integration. For example the Perugia Mobility Plan define the &ldquo;urban and mobility planning areas&rdquo; where the land use changes and the new transport infrastructures are planned and implemented at the same time. The Bolzano Mobility Plan defines specific actions for the open spaces and pedestrian networks, that are considered as an integrated part of the multi-modal transport system. Another example is the Reggio Emilia Mobility Plan, that defines specific actions for the Transit Oriented Development of the metropolitan area. These innovative plans are the first examples of a new approach for the integrated transport and land use planning and represent the first step towards an effective integration towards new mobility patterns in cities and sustainable development of urban areas.";"Enrica Papa

"DOAJ:d3abbe80fede4f68b05cd48674d1a250";"Envisioning Parking Strategies in the Framework of Sustainable Urban Transport";"";"Monetary instruments to regulate parking are often used in central areas of cities to discourage long term parking of vehicles. The availability of parking facilities, and its cost, in fact represents an important element in the decision to operate private vehicles in urban areas. The availability of instruments and tools to check the outcome of modification in parking regulations, in terms of modification of car use, successfully support planners in the determination of the best policies to decrease congestion, and regulate the use of transportation in cities. Integrated land use transportation models may successfully contribute to the assessment of such policy packages. This contribution discusses the use of the model MARS-Bari (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator) for the analysis of future scenarios of development of land use and transportation. MARS-Bari is a fast integrated land use transportation model, which is designed for applications in strategic planning of urban and metropolitan areas. The model was developed as a decision support tool, to help planners in the definition of sets of policies on land use and transportation, and promote equilibrated growth of the urban system (smart growth). MARS-Bari shares the basic assumptions of the Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator (MARS) modeling system, so far successfully applied to many cities of both Europe and Asia. The structure of MARS-Bari is highly flexible on purpose, allowing multiple hypothesis tests of future scenarios and policies. MARS-Bari works at a high level of spatial aggregation, and its simulations are developed on a long-term time horizon (30-years in the current version). Two main sub-models run in MARS-Bari: they respectively simulate the development of land use, and the transportation system. Four different classes of users are distinguished in the transportation model, depending on the possible access to one or more of the five transportation modes: car, motorcycle, bus, train, and slow mode (walk and bike). Car and motorcycle ownership and availability functions contribute to the definition of travel patterns and activity participation of users, in dependence of the chosen residential location and of the location of the economic activities. The model was implemented and tested on the metropolitan area of Bari, Italy. MARS-Bari allows the evaluation of different scenarios of future development of the area, predicting the expected outcomes of policies and interventions on land use development, transportation infrastructures, modifications in the local economy, financial regulations and fares (e.g. fuel price, road pricing, congestion charge, parking fares, etc.). The estimation of indicators for environmental quality and pollutant emissions from transportation permits the direct comparison of the outcomes of different scenarios, thus supporting the definition of sets of &ldquo;second-best&rdquo; choices for policies in both land use and transportation planning.";"Giovanni Circella";"";"University of Naples Federico II";"Directory of Open Access Journals";"2009-05-31";"en;it";"urbanization";"Urban Tenure";"";"150;142;ITA";"Peer-reviewed publication";"http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/58";"";"private://feeds/DOAJ-thumbnail.png";"CC-BY";"http://www.tema.unina.it/index.php/tema/about/submissions#copyrightNotice";""

A questão encontra-se judicializada ea partir de processos iniciados nos anos 1980 (nos quais a própria União é parte autora) que visaram à retirada dos moradores. Levaremos em conta que a política de gestão de imóveis da união tem passado, nesse período, por um processo contínuo e gradativo de mudança de visão, com particular referência às áreas que possuem ocupações consolidadas, com moradias instaladas. A complexidade das relações entre os mais diversos atores institucionais envolvidos permite uma abordagem voltada para a percepção, no campo da realidade, de como o direito à moradia deve (ou pode) se materializar frente à compreensão de argumentos tradicionais do direito. A investigação pressupõe a análise de processo administrativo instruído no âmbito da câmara de conciliação e arbitragem da administração pública federal, utilizando-se os métodos histórico-comparativo, conceitual-dedutivo e empírico-indutivo. Trataremos de demonstrar a validade da teoria política desenvolvida pela crítica comunitarista norte-americana e sua especial contribuição para as noções de justiça segundo a concepção contemporânea. Contextualizaremos o problema concreto enfrentado pela Comunidade do Horto, seu histórico, e esboçaremos o perfil da comunidade, a partir da exposição de dados socioeconómicos das pessoas que habitam o local. Examinaremos as políticas públicas de gestão dos imóveis da união, destacando o papel da secretaria do património da união e as mudanças paradigmáticas dessa gestão, sensivelmente percebidas nas últimas duas décadas.

The question is prosecuted and from cases initiated in the 1980s (in which the Union itself is the plaintiff) who sought the withdrawal of the residents. It will take into account that the management policy of Brazilian government has spent properties in this period, for a continuous and gradual change of vision, with particular reference to areas that have occupations consolidated with housing installed. The complexity of the relationships among the various institutional actors enables a focused approach to the perception in the field of reality, such as the right to housing should (or can) materialize against the traditional understanding of laws. The research involves the analysis of administrative proceedings instructed within the Chamber of Conciliation of the Federal Public Administration, using the historical-comparative, conceptual-deductive and empirical-inductive methods. We will demonstrate the validity of political theory developed by American communitarian critique and its special contribution to the notions of justice in contemporary design. We will contextualize the specific problem faced by the Community of Horto, its history and outline the profile of that community, from the exposure of socio-economic data of the people who inhabit the place. We will examine the public policy of managing properties of Federal Government, highlighting the role of SPU assets and paradigmatic changes that management perceived significantly in the last two decades. We will review the arguments outlined in a lawsuit possessory individual -the Gracinda case -which led to an audit by the Court of Audit, which culminated in a decision rendered in september 2012, which will also be object of our analysis.

numbers of many organismic groups. This article discusses reasons for the outstanding vascular plant diversity using a
hierarchical scale-oriented top-down approach (Grüninger 2005), from the global scale to the local microscale. The global
scale explains general (paleo-) ecological factors valid for most parts of the humid tropics, addressing various hypotheses
and theories, such as the “greater effective evolutionary time”, constant input of “accidentals”, the “seasonal variability hypothesis”,
the “intermediate disturbance hypothesis”, and the impact of soil fertility. The macroscale focuses on the Andes
in northwestern South America. The tropical Andes are characterised by many taxa of restricted range which is particularly
true for the Amotape-Huancabamba region, i.e. the so called Andean Depression, which is effective as discrete phytogeographic
transition as well as barrier zone. Interdigitation of northern and southern flora elements, habitat fragmentation,
geological and landscape history, and a high speciation rate due to rapid genetic radiation of some taxa contribute to a high
degree of diversification. The mesoscale deals with the special environmental features of the eastern mountain range, the
Cordillera Real and surrounding areas in southern Ecuador. Various climatic characteristics, the orographic heterogeneity,
the geologic and edaphic conditions as well as human impact are the most prominent factors augmenting plant species
diversity. On microscale, prevailing regimes of disturbance and environmental stresses, the orographic basement, as well
as the general role on the various mountain chains are considered. Here, micro-habitats e.g. niches for epiphytes, effects of
micro-relief patterns, and successions after small-sized disturbance events are screened. Direct effects of human impact are
addressed and a perspective of possible effects of climate change on plant diversity is presented.";"Michael Richter

Abstract

This research focuses on the analysis of constitutive urban processes rather than preconceived demarcations of urban sites. This is of paramount importance to cast further light on the dynamics and dilemmas which our unequal urban territories are facing. With this view, the research proposes a methodology to identify geographically Madrid’s functional urban area and stablish it distinct zones. This task of zoning combines the existence of an intensity gradient in its constitutive urban processes with the social-spatial segregation pattern of Madrid. After that, a multi-criteria analysis through comparative synthetic indexes will lay the foundation for evaluating the methodology being followed heretofore and the characterization of the functional urban area. Finally, all outcomes will provide us with enough information to express a reasoned judgement on the evolutionary development of the area over the past two decades. The conclusion is the validity of the traditional segregation pattern, as well as the unsustainability of the current model set out in the area.

However, in the Netherlands even small cities will be affected by the phenomenon in the future (Hove et al., 2011), due to the dispersed or mosaic urbanisation patterns in particularly the southern part of the country: the province of North Brabant. This study analyses the average night time land surface temperature (LST) of 21 North-Brabant urban areas through 22 satellite images retrieved by Modis 11A1 during the 2006 heat wave and uses Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper to map albedo and normalized difference temperature index (NDVI) values. Albedo, NDVI and imperviousness are found to play the most relevant role in the increase of night-time LST. The surface cover cluster analysis of these three parameters reveals that the 12 “urban living environment” categories used in the region of North Brabant can actually be reduced to 7 categories, which simplifies the design guidelines to improve the surface thermal behaviour of the different neighbourhoods thus reducing the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in existing medium size cities and future developments adjacent to those cities.";"Leyre Echevarria Icaza

the urban poor and the need for regularization of the consequent
illegal occupations in urban areas are two of the most
important issues on the Latin American land policy agenda.
Taking a structural/integrated view on the functioning
of the urban land market in Latin America, this paper discusses
the nexus between the formal and the informal land markets. It
thus exposes the perverse feedback effects that curative regularization
policies may have on the process by which irregularity is
produced in the first place.
The paper suggests that a more effective approach to the
provision of serviced land for the poor cannot be resolved within
the prevailing (curative) regularization programs. These programs
should have the capacity to mobilize the resources that
do exist into a comprehensive program that links regularization
with fiscal policy, including the exploration of value capture

Different reflections are here presented to comprehend how is it possible to implement cities’ ability to understand and manage metropolitan dynamics. In Europe, urbanisation and land abandonment is a widespread phenomenon compared to many other parts of the world. According to research carried out by the European Union it is estimated that four out of five European citizens will be living in urban areas abandoning villages and rural areas. 
Many European metropolitan areas are character-rized by overpopulated centres, degraded suburbs and different abandoned or almost abandoned inland areas. These areas, if well connected among them and to the main metropolitan centre, can contribute to solving many urban challenges. There is the necessity to image metropolitan areas as a single entity to increase the cohesion of lands. The latent capital of inland areas can be considered as driving factor behind territorial cohesion and development. This paper analyses in deep the case of the Italian Metropolitan Cities proposing a new governance approach to increase the capacity of urban systems to adapt to natural and man-made changes, considering the hinterland as a strong point rather than a disadvantage.  
Strategic and Spatial Plans drive the growth of metropolitan areas in a competitive space-economy and support sustainable development policy by ensuring a balance between urban areas with strong competitiveness and inland areas.";"Francesca Pirlone

To switch to another economic system began a gradual process of transformation of agricultural enterprises. The result of this process was the change in the structure of agrarian enterprises due to privatization and raspaevaniya land, and appearance from small-scale farms to large agricultural enterprises. Today identified market actors (enterprises) in agriculture: business companies, private enterprises, production cooperatives, farmers, public enterprises, other forms of management.

The most common kind of private business are farms. They are one of the most promising and effective forms of management with high agriculture, appropriate level of production organization, prudent attitude to the land and best landscaping. However, today the formation of farming in Ukraine has not yet reached the level of development, which is observed in economically developed countries. The overall economic decline and inadequate legislation has forced farmers to rely on themselves. Notes the insufficient level of their competitiveness, making it impossible to provide the expanded reproduction, determines the risk of insolvency and, as a consequence, leads to bankruptcy. Farmers receive government support, but it is weak and temporary, which greatly impedes their development. Practical state support only a few farms that can affect the distribution of funds.

Agricultural cooperation is one of the effective forms of management, which aims to unite the producers in the direction of increase of efficiency of use of their resource potential. However, today there are a number of unresolved problems that hinder the effective development of agricultural cooperatives. Since 2000 years, the initiative in the development of the agrarian reform moves from state to agribusiness, a manifestation of which was the emergence of agroholdings. Non-agricultural economic entities have been actively involved in agricultural production and to make significant investments in the agricultural sector of the economy. The main motive of infusion of funds the hope was cheap to buy and expensive to sell, waiting for a quick profit at any cost. However, over time there is a gradual slowdown in the trend to the accumulation of land in the ownership of agricultural holdings and the transition to improve the efficiency of production. Activity of agricultural holdings leads to the displacement of traditional forms of agricultural production of farms. Development of rural areas needs to be addressed through focused public policy and assistance to farms, which are production facilities.

Part of the process of formation of the economy is the agricultural enterprises of market type, the development of which depends on the complexity of the implementation of the governance arrangements that should ensure the sustainable use and protection of land.";"Butenko E

Aspetti di innovazione tecnologica e digitale a supporto del processo di riforma della Pubblica Amministrazione";"";"Nello scritto si illustra l’esperienza condotta dal Politecnico di Torino nel 2007 - su istanza della Direzione Regionale per i Beni Culturali e Paesaggistici del Piemonte - denominata “Progetto
iVincoli” (2007-2008): l’esito, nella sua versione prototipale, è la configurazione e realizzazione di una piattaforma tecnologica predisposta per la definizione di linee-guida destinate al monitoraggio e alla pubblicazione on line delle attività vincolistiche.
Tale SIT ad accesso multiprofilo consente, tra le funzionalità previste: la consultazione pubblica delle informazioni relative agli edifici monitorati anche sottoposti a vincolo di tutela; il monitoraggio dell’iter delle pratiche di vincolo da parte della Direzione Regionale, degli Enti Locali e dei soggetti privati coinvolti, denominato “work flow delle pratiche amministrative”; la creazione di specifici percorsi tematici di tipo turistico.
Tale esperienza parte da una precisa premessa: ogni architettura informativa a servizio di atti e processi della Pubblica Amministrazione viene a configurarsi quale strumento prototipale di supporto alla riforma della stessa PA e alla governance. A fronte di tali ragionamenti, le Pubbliche Amministrazioni al momento
attuale si stanno confrontando, da una parte, con i processi e i dibattiti in corso sul trasferimento delle funzioni centrali; dall’altra, per l’aspetto di innovazione tecnologica con le direttive introdotte a partire dal Codice Unico della Pubblica Amministrazione Digitale.
Di fatto, uno dei tasselli per la messa a punto di atti che innestino sinergie tra innovazione, efficienza amministrativa e gestione del territorio per una sua valorizzazione è costituito da processi d’implementazione di architetture informative configurate in SIT.

Training in the land - is the formation of staff knowledge and skills in a particular professional field, that training people who want to get a profession in the field of land relations and the use and protection of land and other natural resources.

In this connection the question the quality of the professionals who work in the system of land and land management enterprises. So in recent years, the system of land worked by 25 thousand. People .. to 28 thousand. People. The number of employees of DerzhzemahenstvaUkraine(and today DerzhheokadastruUkraine) ranged from 9.5 - 10 thousand. People. Thus, in stateenterprisesLandManagement Institute, Centre of state land cadastre and land management of private enterprises and entrepreneurs are about 18 thousand. People. In the system of fixed services is almost 90% of workers with higher education. But of these, only about about 70% have higher education universities III-IV accreditation levels, and only about 50% - land management. Managers and professionals who have land management and land use close to education up together with the Bachelor education only 64% of the total number of employees.

Thus, the problem of professional education in the field of land is very relevant. It is necessary to consider further training of land-management education for integrated communities.

The article is justification for expanding areas of training in the field of land management and the introduction of new professions (specializations) and the management of natural areas.

According to Article 66 of the Law of Ukraine ""On Land Management"" of 22.05.2003 number 858-IV, professional activities in the field of land may engage citizens with special higher education levels and appropriate professional guidance. Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on April 29, 2015 № 266 determined instead specialties ""Land Management and Cadastre"" and ""assessment of land and property"" - specialty ""Geodesy and Land Management"" which referred to the field of knowledge ""Architecture and Construction"", which refers to the engineering sciences .

However, the definition of land according to the law ofUkraine""On Land Management"" activities in the field of land management and land use documentation content, a specialty of the land should belong to the natural sciences or management.

Search discourse of the theory of Land Management shows that there are many concepts and categories in the field of land management in particular, such as ""innovations in land management"", ""economy land"", ""Legal Land Management"", ""technical land management"", ""cadastral survey"", ""ecological land management"" ""social Land Management"", ""Land Management design.""

Absolute champion mentions in the Internet Google is ""land economics"" (494 thousand. Mentions), followed by ""technical land management"" (487 thousand. References). It noted widespread references in the search engine world for Ukraine Yandex.ua term ""cadastral survey"" (6 million. Mentions), followed by ""technical land management"" (5 million. References), legal, social and environmental land management by 4 million. Mentions. Is ambiguous definition of recurrence frame ""ecological economy"" and «Ecological and economic land management». Thus, according Yandex.ua, leader of «Ecological and economic land management» (8 million. Mentions) and the version of Google.com leader «Ecological and economic land management» (3 million. References). This communication should focus that the terms in English prevail in times of recurrence in the same terms in Ukrainian or Russian.

In this regard, in our view, training in land management, inventory, assessment and land protection must be understood as education relevant educational qualification (Bachelor, Master) in ""Architecture and Construction"" (code 19), "" Management and administration ""(code 07),"" Natural Science ""(code 10) and professions (specializations) related to professional management, environmental, economic, scientific and other activities consisting of the central and local authorities, enterprises, institutions and organizations regardless of ownership.

At present the main problems of preparation, training and retraining in the field of land management are the lack of a systematic approach to funding, standardization organization and implementation of educational and research activities in the field of land management, inventory and appraisal and land protection, expansion professions (specializations) related with administrative, environmental, economic, scientific and other activities in the field of land management.

It is proposed to expand the training of specialists in the field of land appropriate educational qualification (Bachelor, Master) in ""management and administration"" (code 07), ""Natural Science"" (code 10) and professions (specializations) related to professional management, environmental, economic, scientific and other activities.";"Tretiak A.

During the centrally planned economic system that the natural contrast of the Polesie land had been somewhat neglected by the state through differentiation of purchase prices for agricultural products, which gave the possibility of redistribution of the rent in favor of the farms with poorer land. With transition to market relations the role of the state, and hence the possibility of its influence on this situation has changed dramatically. Economic conditions have become more profitable for the farmers that are occupying the best lands.

However, the situation in the regions has not yet been investigated systematically taking into account the modern complex socio-economic processes and phenomena caused by increased environmental stress on land resources.

One of the most pernicious environmental effects of the Chernobyl accident was radioactive contamination of agricultural land, defined in the final stage of transfer of radionuclides in the human body and further irradiation. The main danger of the accumulation by plants of radionuclides lies in the fact that they are a major link in the migratory chain of transmission of radionuclides to the more radiosensitive species and, above all, human. Economic feature of agricultural production in the study area is insufficient pricesambien, transformation of land use, violations of industrial-economic relations, the structure of agricultural production, changes in the natural-cost structure commodity products, the reform of the organizational structure of agricultural production.

In the farms located in contaminated areas, the necessary conversion of dairy cattle for meat. In conditions of high pollution, the production of milk requires a serious sanitary objections in that time, as meat production is more environmentally friendly.

The suspension of activities and the provision of radioactively clean food products led to the growth of volumes of consumption of contaminated food of local production, the increase in the number of people exceeding the doses of internal irradiation and the deterioration of the health status of the people of radioactively contaminated territories.

The main component of the mechanism by contaminated land is agricultural activities (placement of crops, depending on the ability to accumulate radionuclides, soil treatment), agrochemical activities (liming of acidic soils, application of mineral and organic fertilizers and the use of sorbents, change of mode of feeding of animals and processing of animal products to reduce the content of radionuclides. Of course, the above list of events is far from complete, this is only the basic that require mandatory implementation in agricultural production.

Among the measures of rehabilitation of polluted areas leading place belongs to the radical improvement of meadows and pastures, which in turn requires a considerable amount of seeds of cereals and legumes. The analysis of economic efficiency of growing of the testes, including radioactively contaminated region shows that even in marginal soils of Polesye in low yield of the seed farms have substantial profits.

On soils with acidity the most common and affordable event reduce radionuclide accumulation in products is liming, which not only reduces the accumulation of radionuclides in agricultural crops but also improves soil fertility, increases yield and contributes to the dilution of radionuclides per unit mass of crop production.
