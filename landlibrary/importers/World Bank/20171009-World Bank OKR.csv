handle:10986/10165;Measuring National Income and Growth in Resource-Rich, Income-Poor Countries;;In the decade leading to the recent commodity boom, which peaked in 2007-08, several resource-rich, low-income countries displayed high rates of gross domestic product (GDP) growth while social indicators did not improve significantly. It is well known that, in itself, the widely tracked GDP may not be the most relevant summary of aggregate economic performance in all places at all times. This note suggests that for countries with significant exhaustible natural resources and important foreign-investor presence, adjusted net national income (aNNI), can usefully complement GDP to assess economic progress.;"Hamilton, Kirk

handle:10986/10347;Colombia : Land Policy in Transition;;Only 30 percent of land suitable for agriculture is utilized for crops (with significant regional variation). More than double the area suitable for pasture is used for livestock grazing, with negative environmental consequences. Although markets provide land access to poor and productive producers, they are not effective in transferring land from large to small producers, implying continuing concentration, driven largely by violence and displacement. Data from about 800 municipalities show that high land inequality is associated with greater expansion of livestock farming into ecologically fragile areas unsuitable for farming, and underutilization of agricultural land. This inhibits Colombia from realizing its comparative advantage in perennials and high-value-added crops, and reduces the agricultural sector's contribution to economic growth.;"Deininger, Klaus

handle:10986/10901;Public Land Governance in Solomon Islands;;In countries where a large proportion of the total land area is held customarily, reform questions around land and development often tend to focus on the customary estate. Evidence from Solomon Islands suggests that a focus on public land holdings, even when they are relatively small in land area, can yield outsized benefits. Publicly owned land regularly includes economically valuable land and urban land on which development pressure is high. In Solomon Islands, as much as 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may be affected by how effectively urban public land is governed.;Williams, Shaun;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-02-28;en;"agriculture;land administration;land management;land ownership;land reform;land tenure;landowners;leases;rural development;tenants";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;SLB";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/10901;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/10901/1/600640NEWS0P111Box0358368B01PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/10901/600640NEWS0P111Box0358368B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/10932;Women, State Law and Land in Peri-Urban Settlements on Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands;;This paper provides a brief overview of the intersection of state and customary laws governing land in peri-urban settlements around Honiara, focusing on their impact upon landowners, particularly women landowners. It suggests that the intersection of customary and state legal systems allows a small number of individuals, predominantly men, to solidify their control over customary land. This has occurred to the detriment of many landowners, who have often found themselves excluded from both decision-making processes and the distribution of financial benefits from the use of land. This contributes to social conflict and undermines the legitimacy of land dealings, and as the Tensions demonstrate, can ultimately lead to violent conflict.;Monson, Rebecca;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-04-30;en;"land ownership;land rights;land tenure;landowners;property rights;urban areas;urbanization";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;SLB";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/10932;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/10932/1/544240Briefing1Guadalcanal1SolIslds.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/10932/544240Briefing1Guadalcanal1SolIslds.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/11757;Regulatory Frameworks for Water Resources Management : A Comparative Study;;This note contains a summary, for practitioners, of the World Bank Law, Justice, and Development Series Book Regulatory Frameworks for Water Resources Management: a comparative study (2006). It examines how the regulatory frameworks in 16 jurisdictions worldwide have addressed the various basic issues related to water resources management, provides a comparative analysis of those issues, and highlights the essential elements of the regulatory frameworks that are emerging in response. Most countries have laws or regulations (and in fewer cases constitutional clauses) relating to ownership, management, and allocation of water. These provisions are often, however, out of date, over complex, lacking in clarity, or fragmented. For the comparative analysis, regulatory frameworks for water resources management were selected from 16 jurisdictions: Armenia, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Costa Rica, European Union (EU), France, Germany, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Senegal, South Africa, Vietnam, and the Republic of Yemen.;"Salman, Salman M.A.

handle:10986/11791;Notes on the Economic Evaluation of Transport Projects;;"In response to many requests for help in the application of both conventional cost benefit analysis in transport and addressing of the newer topics of interest, we have prepared a series of Economic Evaluation Notes that provide guidance on some of issues that have proven more difficult to deal with. The Economic Evaluation Notes are arranged in three groups. The first group (TRN-6 to TRN-10) provides criteria for selection a particular evaluation technique or approach; the second (TRN-11 to TRN-17) addresses the selection of values of various inputs to the evaluation, and the third (TRN-18 to TRN-26) deals with specific problematic issues in economic evaluation. The Notes are preceded by a Framework (TRN-5), that provides the context within which we use economic evaluation in the transport sector. Economic evaluation involves the assessment of the net value of projects and policies. In the transport sector we value projects in terms of their net worth, the difference between the value of their benefits and their costs, both measured so far as is possible in terms of monetary units. This disarmingly simple statement leads to many questions; evaluation by whom, for whom, from what perspective, at what stage. One of the features of transport decisions is that they typically impact on many parties - transport operators, individual transport users, local residents and businesses, land and property owners, national and local taxpayers.";"Mackie, Peter

handle:10986/12427;The Little Green Data Book 2005;;The Little Green Data Book 2005 is based on the World Development Indicators 2005, and represents an abbreviated collection of information. Its production is a collaboration between the Development Economics Data Development Group, and the Environment Department of the World Bank. Development and poverty alleviation-the World Bank's mission-call for a long-term vision. Enhancing environmental quality, improving natural resource management, and maintaining global ecosystems are all important steps toward this goal. To achieve these lasting results we need to start from a sound base of information that helps us set priorities and measure progress toward environmental sustainability goals. The Little Green Data Book is a step in this direction, with key indicators of the environment and its relationship to people for more than 200 countries. This year's edition includes new indicators for fish catch, in the agriculture and fisheries section, and biomass fuel use, in the energy section. While there are gaps and shortcomings in the data, we hope this book will inspire decision makers at all levels to use this information and to seek to fill the gaps for their own countries. This year will be remembered for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. It also marked a renewed commitment by the G-8 countries to foster development in Africa. Finally, this year will witness the reconstruction efforts following the tsunami disaster in South and East Asia.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2005-12-31;en;"deforestation;fisheries;rural population;sustainable development;urban population;waste";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/12427;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/12423/1/34394.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/12423/34394.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

It is based on qualitative research data that was collected during field visits between July and November 2007 in three arid lands districts in Northern Kenya - Isiolo, Baringo/East Pokot and Garissa. Research areas were selected to gain insight into conflict and legal dynamics among a variety of ethnic groups and in differing ecological and political environments. Research tools mainly consisted of semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation. New research tools, such as legal aid days, were piloted during the study. About 80 interviews were conducted with a broad range of individuals, ranging from formal authorities to peace committee members, NGOs, CSOs, informal authorities, women groups, youth groups and others.;Chopra, Tanja;;"World Bank Group;Legal Resources Foundation Trust";World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"boundaries;capacity building";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"002;KEN";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/12602;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/12602/1/716910ESW0P1110ce0in0Northern0Kenya.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/12602/716910ESW0P1110ce0in0Northern0Kenya.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/13171;Gender and Agriculture : Inefficiencies, Segregation, and Low Productivity Traps;;Women make essential contributions to agriculture in developing countries, where they constitute approximately 43 percent of the agricultural labor force. However, female farmers typically have lower output per unit of land and are much less likely to be active in commercial farming than their male counterparts. These gender differences in land productivity and participation between male and female farmers are due to gender differences in access to inputs, resources, and services. In this paper, the authors review the evidence on productivity differences and access to resources. They discuss some of the reasons for these differences, such as differences in property rights, education, control over resources (e.g., land), access to inputs and services (e.g., fertilizer, extension, and credit), and social norms. Although women are less active in commercial farming and are largely excluded from contract farming, they often provide the bulk of wage labor in the nontraditional export sector. In general, gender gaps do not appear to fall systematically with growth, and they appear to rise with GDP per capita and with greater access to resources and inputs. Active policies that support women's access and participation, not just greater overall access, are essential if these gaps are to be closed. The gains in terms of greater productivity of land and overall production are likely to be large.;"Croppenstedt, Andre

handle:10986/13255;City Finances of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia;;Ulaanbaatar's (UB) population has swollen from half a million in 2001 to approximately 1.2 million in 2011, accounting for over 40 percent of the country's population. This trend is likely to continue as economic growth is increasingly concentrated in UB. With its growing population and concerns in rising inequality, the city is facing increasing pressure to maintain and expand service provision (especially infrastructure). The local tax on wages is expected to continue to provide substantial revenues to the UB government, which will assist the growing demand for services. Additionally, a new 'capital city tax' is expected to come into effect in 2013. The decision of the central government (CG) to pursue further decentralization gives greater leadership to the UB government and its districts. It also provides local broader decision-making authority as well as opportunity for citizen's participation and for the improvement of governance and transparency. Therefore, a key challenge for UB and its districts is ensuring that the local fiscal system is sound and ready to handle a greater volume of revenues to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. The city also needs to develop a robust and transparent fiscal management system if it is to make an effective use of new revenue sources. The main objective of this study is to understand the inner workings of the municipal finance system in Ulaanbaatar and its districts.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2013-12-31;en;"decentralization;land use;urbanization";Urban Tenure;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;MNG";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/13255;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/13255/1/725140ESW0P1300s0of0Ulaanbaatar0eng.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13255/725140ESW0P1300s0of0Ulaanbaatar0eng.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Part I examines the fiscal, and debt sustainability, proposing a three-fold strategy: a) efforts for an urgent renewal are needed to consolidate macroeconomic stability -- fundamentally, a significant fiscal adjustment is required; b) debt relief should be considered, given the large burden, and there is the need to preserve social expenditures; and c) decisive structural reforms are necessary to underpin fiscal adjustment, and increase the efficiency of resource uses. Part II examines the structural issues, particularly the tax system, and the role of the state in infrastructure and utilities, focusing on accelerating the transformation of public infrastructure and utility companies, and how to improve taxation.

handle:10986/14919;Truck Drivers and Casual Sex : An Inquiry into the Potential Spread of HIV/AIDS in the Baltic Region;;This study, perhaps the first of its kind in this region, is based on a study that explores the practice of casual sex among truck drivers, and commercial sex workers in the border areas of the Baltic region at a point of time, and, uses this evidence to extrapolate the potential impact on the spread of HIV/AIDS in these countries. While the threat of an HIV/AIDS epidemic cannot be taken lightly in any country of the Europe and Central Asia region, four countries - Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia - stand out as being particularly vulnerable. First, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is relatively high, and is rapidly increasing in locations neighboring these countries to the east, like Ukraine, Kaliningrad, Belarus, and Moldova, where public health conditions are also rapidly deteriorating. Second, because of their geographical location, those four countries stand at the crossroads of the main east-west, and north-south transport corridors, and represent the link between countries of the former Soviet Union and western Europe. The open borders, and rapid transit threatens to broaden the sweep of the HIV epidemic, as drug injectors and sex workers come into contact with other population groups. After the Introduction which provides background, Section 2 reviews similar studies carried out elsewhere in the world. Section 3 describes the methodology employed in this study, followed by a brief description of the data in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 contains a discussion of the results, and policy implications.;"Kulis, Marzena

handle:10986/15066;Poverty in Guatemala;;Poverty in Guatemala is high and deep. In 2000, over half of all Guatemalans lived in poverty. About 16 percent lived in extreme poverty. Available evidence suggests that poverty in Guatemala is higher than in other Central American countries. Although poverty has fallen over the past decade, its trend recently declined due to a series of economic shocks during 2001 and 2002. The drop of poverty incidence since 1990 is slightly slower than what would have been predicted given Guatemala's growth rates, suggesting that growth has not been particularly pro-poor. This pattern arises largely because growth in the rural sectors-where the poor are largely concentrated-has been slower than in other areas. Poverty and vulnerability are mainly chronic whereas only a fifth were transient poor. Likewise, while 64 percent of the population could be considered vulnerable to poverty, the majority of these are vulnerable due to low overall expected consumption rather than high volatility of consumption. The chronic nature of poverty and vulnerability highlights the importance of building the assets of the poor, rather than focusing primarily on the expansion of public safety nets or social insurance. Nonetheless, some public transfers (social assistance) could indeed be desirable to alleviate the poverty and suffering of the extreme poor, particularly when linked to participation in health and education activities. The Peace Accords represented a turning point for Guatemala's development path, paving the way for a transformation to a more prosperous and inclusive nation. Key areas related to economic development and poverty reduction include: a focus on human development, productive and sustainable development, modernization of the democratic state, and strengthening and promoting participation. The rights of the indigenous and women were also highlighted as cross-cutting themes throughout the accords, in an attempt to reverse the historical exclusion of these groups.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2004-12-31;en;"capacity building;food security;rural areas";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;"419;GTM";Reports & Research;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/15066;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/15066/1/275860PAPER0English0Poverty0in0Guatemala.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/15066/275860PAPER0English0Poverty0in0Guatemala.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/15125;Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction;;"Land policies are of fundamental importance to sustainable growth, good governance, and the well-being of, and the economic opportunities open to, both rural and urban dwellers - particularly the poor. To this end, research on land policy, and analysis of interventions related to the subject, have long been of interest to the Bank's Research Department, and other academic, and civil society institutions. The report aims to strengthen the effectiveness of land policy in support of development, and poverty reduction, by setting out the results of recent research in a way that is accessible to a wide audience of policymakers, nongovernmental organizations, academics in the Bank's client countries, donor agency officials, and the broader development community. Its main message rests on three principles: 1) provision of secure tenure to land improves the welfare of the poor, particularly by enhancing the asset base of those whose land rights are often neglected, and, creates incentives needed for investment, paramount to sustainable economic growth; 2) facilitation of land exchange, and distribution, whether as an asset or for current services, at low cost, through markets, and non-market channels, will expedite land access by productive, but land-poor producers, so that once economic growth improves, financial markets would rely on the use of land as collateral; and, 3) governments' contribution to the promotion of socially desirable land allocation, and utilization. The report discusses mechanisms to promote tenure security, demonstrates the importance of rental market transactions, arguing the removal of impediments to these can generate equity advantages, and positive investments. It also illustrates mechanisms, ranging from taxation, to regulation and land use planning to address these issues.";Deininger, Klaus;;"World Bank Group;Oxford University Press";World Bank Group;2003-12-31;en;"property rights;land tenure;land use;land rent;land reform;land use planning;agrarian reform;agriculture;indigenous peoples;land administration;land distribution;land management;land markets;land ownership;land reform;land rights;land tenure;land use;land use planning;landowners;leases;property rights;sustainable development;transaction costs;urban planning;zoning";"Land & Investments;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;Reports & Research;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/15125;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/15125/1/multi0page.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/15125/multi0page.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

By 2050 these numbers are likely to more than double, leading to a greater concentration of hazard risk in many of the world's cities. The authors discuss what sets hazard risk in urban areas apart, summarize estimates of valuation of hazard risk, and discuss implications for individual mitigation and public policy. The main conclusions are that urban agglomeration economies change the cost–benefit calculation of hazard mitigation; that good hazard management is first and foremost good general urban management; and that the public sector must perform better in promoting market-based risk reduction by generating and disseminating credible information on hazard risk in cities.";"Lall, Somik V.

handle:10986/16032;Republic of Armenia : Accumulation, Competition, and Connectivity;;"By 2013, the Armenian economy has left behind most of the hangover from the global financial crisis and a look at medium-to long-term growth drivers is therefore in order. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth reached 7.2 percent in 2012, and the current account deficit narrowed, although it remained high. Macroeconomic buffers have been rebuilt to some extent, although the public debt-to-GDP ratio, at 44 percent, remains too high to relax fiscal restraints. The central tenet of this report is that the government's job creation agenda requires a different growth model than the one followed before the global crisis. Reaching the goals of the government's strategy will require a combination of four factors: 1) higher investment and better financial intermediation between savers and investors; 2) better utilization of the labor force, including the largely untapped resource of Armenians abroad; 3) stronger competitive pressures in the markets for goods and services, which will improve incentives for companies to innovate, adopt new technologies, and become more efficient; and 4) enhanced connections of the landlocked Armenian economy with world markets, including through land, air, and through internet and communication technologies. This report's theoretical framework emphasizes structural reforms to drive growth. Economic growth theory distinguishes between accumulation of the factors of production and enhancing the productivity with which these factors are employed.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2013-04-30;en;forestry;Forest Tenure;;"150;143;ARM";Training Resources & Tools;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/16032;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/16032/1/768270ESW0P1270ox379788B00PUBLIC000.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/16032/768270ESW0P1270ox379788B00PUBLIC000.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/16650;Lesotho : A Safety Net to End Extreme Poverty;;"The objective of this study is to help the government to decide what role safety net and transfer programs should play in the coming 5 to 10 years. It seeks to answer following three questions: (i) can increased spending on transfers accelerate poverty reduction in the medium to long term?; (ii) which groups and aspects of poverty will it make sense to target with transfers?; and (iii) which programs will have the greatest impact at an affordable cost? This study examined such programs in Lesotho both ones that currently exist, and the potential scope for using instruments that may not currently exist. It also widened its scope to examine all programs that transfer public resources directly to households such as agricultural subsidies and university bursaries. It analyzed them through the lens of their impact on the poor because it is important to evaluate public spending and trade-offs in the context of where public funds are currently being spent and what distributional impact they are having. The assumption underlying this analysis throughout the report is that the over-riding objective of both the government and its development partners is to reduce the high levels of poverty and inequality that persist in Lesotho. This report is organized as follows: chapter one explores the country context and fiscal space for public expenditure on social safety nets. Chapter two examines the dynamics of poverty in Lesotho and the characteristics of the major vulnerable groups and discusses which of these groups it will make most sense for the social safety net to target.

handle:10986/16788;Tanzania Poverty, Growth, and Public Transfers : Options for a National Productive Safety Net Program;;"Tanzania has made significant economic progress in the recent past, with per capita national income almost doubling from United States (U.S.) 230 dollars equivalent in the late-1990s to U.S. 440 dollars. This report explores the role safety nets and transfers can play in reducing poverty more rapidly in Tanzania. It presents the potential need and costs, to inform a debate of options. The report reviews existing programs, and provides recommendations for an action plan to strengthen the current system and develop a more unified national program, one which will have a greater impact on poverty levels at reasonable cost, in line with the Government's poverty reduction strategy, known by the Swahili acronym MKUKUTA. The report looks at transfers to the poor, including public works employment, subsidies, food distribution programs, cash and in-kind transfers, and vouchers. This paper is organized in following chapters: chapter one gives introduction; attempts to lay out what the options might be, within an analytical assessment of the nature of poverty and shocks faced by the poor in Tanzania is given in chapter two; chapter three examines the effectiveness of existing transfer programs; at a strategic level it then evaluates the capacity of the state to spend on transfers, and how safety net programs can fit into the wider national development agenda is given in chapter four. The paper concludes by discussing some of the institutional and administrative concerns that effect program design in chapter five; and outlines for a series of immediate steps to improve the effectiveness of existing programs; as well as a medium-term strategy for moving towards a more unified national program is discussed in chapter six.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-09-21;en;"food security;rural areas;rural population";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;"TZA;002";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/16788;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/16788/1/646200ESW0P123000PUBLIC00Box379832B.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/16788/646200ESW0P123000PUBLIC00Box379832B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/17282;The Implementation of Industrial Parks : Some Lessons Learned in India;;Industrial parks are as popular as they are controversial, in India and globally. At their best they align infrastructure provision and agglomeration economies to jolt industrial growth. More often, they generate negative spill-overs, provide handouts, sit empty, or simply do not get built. This paper disaggregates how parks are built and how they fail. It contextualizes parks in India, followed by a thick case study of an innovative scheme that appears to buck the trend. This performance is then explained by the way in which the scheme's design and action fit India's political economy. The paper concludes by considering how the analysis and the lessons learned might inform the design and implementation of industrial park programs and other public interventions, in India and elsewhere.;"Saleman, Yannick

handle:10986/17591;Converting Land into Affordable Housing Floor Space;;"Cities emerge from the spatial concentration of people and economic activities. But spatial concentration is not enough; the economic viability of cities depends on people, ideas, and goods to move rapidly across the urban area. This constant movement within dense cities creates wealth but also various degrees of unpleasantness and misery that economists call negative externalities, such as congestion, pollution, and environmental degradation. In addition, the poorest inhabitants of many cities are often unable to afford a minimum-size dwelling with safe water and sanitation, as if the wealth created by cities was part of a zero-sum game where the poor will be at the losing end. The main challenge for urban planners and economists is reducing cities' negative externalities without destroying the wealth created by spatial concentration. To do that, they must plan and design infrastructure and regulations while leaving intact the self-organizing created by land and labor markets. The balance between letting markets work and correcting market externalities through infrastructure investment and regulation is difficult to achieve. Too often, planners play sorcerer's apprentice when dealing with markets whose functioning they poorly understand. The role of the urban planner is then, first, to better understand the complex interaction between market forces and government interventions, infrastructure investment and regulation, and second, to design these interventions based on precise quantitative objectives. Each city's priorities would depend on its history, circumstances, and political environment. But maintaining mobility and keeping land affordable remains the main urban planning objective common to all cities.";Bertaud, Alain;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2013-11-30;en;"decentralization;land markets;land speculation;land use;property rights;slums;squatters;transaction costs;urban planning;urban population;urbanization";"Land & Investments;Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/17591;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/17591/1/842520WP0Bertaud0Box0382136B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/17591/842520WP0Bertaud0Box0382136B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;;
handle:10986/17597;Are Cities the New Growth Escalator?;;Urban areas tend to have much more productive labor and higher salaries than rural areas, and there are vast differences across urban areas. Areas with high salaries and high productivity tend to have employers that invest in much more research and development than areas with low salaries and low productivity. This paper addresses two questions. First, it discusses the causes of these vast geographical differences in wages, human capital, and innovation. The second part of the paper discusses regional economic development policies. The European Union has an even more ambitious program transferring its development funds to regions with below average incomes. Asian countries, especially China, have a variety of special economic zones, designed to attract foreign investment to specific areas. Such regional development policies, often called place-based economic policies, are effectively a form of welfare, targeting cities or regions, not individuals. While such policies are widespread, the economic logic behind them is rarely discussed and even less frequently understood. This paper clarifies when these policies are wasteful, when they are efficient, and who the expected winners and losers are. Understanding when government intervention makes sense and when it does not is a crucial first step in setting sound economic development policies. Local governments can certainly lay a foundation for economic development and create all the conditions necessary for a city's rebirth, including a business climate friendly to job creation.;Moretti, Enrico;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2013-11-30;en;"land use;occupation;urban areas;waste";;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/17597;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/17597/1/842280WP0Moret0Box0382136B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/17597/842280WP0Moret0Box0382136B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;;
handle:10986/17744;Urbanization and (In)Formalization;;Inexorable urbanization and formalization have been the expectations in development discourse. Indeed, measures of urbanization and formalization have been provided and used as indicators of development. But while urbanization has proceeded apace in developing countries, formalization has slowed significantly over the past quarter century. These disconnect raises questions for development analysis and development policy. Why did one expect urbanization and formalization to go together in the first place? Is the link between urbanization and formalization more complex than what had once thought? What then explains the recent disconnect between urbanization and formalization? Is formalization a reasonable policy goal? May urbanization policies and formalization policies conflict? If so, what can be done to resolve the conflicts? These are the questions this paper addresses. The paper has three core sections. The first section asks what exactly is meant by formality and informality. The second section turns to urbanization processes and asks how they intersect with and interact with the incentives to formalize. The third section looks at policy. Each view of how urbanization feeds formalization has distinctive policy conclusions.;"Ghani, Ejaz

handle:10986/18736;Republic of India : Accelerating Agricultural Productivity Growth;;"In the past 50 years, Indian agriculture has undergone a major transformation, from dependence on food aid to becoming a consistent net food exporter. The gradual reforms in the agricultural sector (following the broader macro-reforms of the early 1990s) spurred some unprecedented innovations and changes in the food sector driven by private investment. These impressive achievements must now be viewed in light of the policy and investment imperatives that lie ahead. Agricultural growth has improved in recent years (averaging about 3.5 percent since 2004-05), but at a long-term trend rate of growth of 3 percent, agriculture has underperformed relative to its potential. The pockets of post-reform dynamism that have emerged evidently have not reached a sufficiently large scale to influence the sector's performance. For the vast population that still derives a living directly or indirectly from agriculture, achieving ""faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth', the objectives at the heart of the Twelfth five year plan, depends critically on simultaneous efforts to improve agriculture's performance and develop new sources of employment for the disproportionately large share of the labor force still on the farm. The scope of this study is broad in the sense that it marshals considerable empirical evidence and analyses to address those issues. Yet the scope is restricted in the sense that the study does not address all of the issues. A wealth of knowledge exists (and continuing analytical work proceeds) on other major strategic issues, water and irrigation management, food grain management, and public expenditures on agriculture, for example, and the findings of this study must be seen in that context. The lack of sufficient quality data, and often the lack of access to such data, also prevents some issues from being explored in greater depth. Finally, some important issues require more focused and dedicated analysis, such as food safety and quality standards, agricultural trade, and food price increases. This relationship between longer-term strategic issues and contemporary concerns, such as water resource management and food prices, are highlighted in this study through the prism of productivity, but they too require further analysis to fully address the underlying issues.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-05-21;en;"agriculture;climate change;contract farming;decentralization;farmers;food security;land use;rural development;sustainable development;urbanization";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"IND;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18736;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/18736/5/880930REVISED00ivity0Growth00PUBLIC.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/18736/880930ESW0whit0385228B00PUBLIC00ACS.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;;
handle:10986/18742;Analyzing Urban Systems : Have Megacities Become Too Large?;;The trend toward ever greater urbanization continues unabated across the globe. According to the United Nations, by 2025 closes to 5 billion people will live in urban areas. Many cities, especially in the developing world, are set to explode in size. Over the next decade and a half, Lagos is expected to increase its population 50 percent, to nearly 16 million. Naturally, there is an active debate on whether restricting the growth of megacities is desirable and whether doing so can make residents of those cities and their countries better off. When analyzing whether megacities have become too large, policy makers often analyze a single city in depth. But no city is an island: improving urban infrastructure in one city might attract migrants, and a negative shock in one location can be mitigated because people can move to another. Considering the general equilibrium effects of any such urban policy is thus key. That is, when deciding whether to make medium-size cities more attractive, policy makers need to understand how cities of all sizes will be affected. The second section briefly summarizes the theoretical framework and discusses which data are needed. The third section implements the methodology for the benchmark case of the United States. The fourth section does the same for China and Mexico and compares the findings. And the last section concludes. A technical online appendix guides the reader through a practical, step-by-step, discussion of how to do the analysis.;"Desmet, Klaus

handle:10986/18743;Urbanization as Opportunity;;Urbanization deserves urgent attention from policy makers, academics, entrepreneurs, and social reformers of all stripes. Nothing else will create as many opportunities for social and economic progress. The urbanization project began roughly 1,000 years after the transition from the Pleistocene to the milder and more stable Holocene interglacial. In 2010, the urban population in developing countries stood at 2.5 billion. The developing world can accommodate the urban population growth and declining urban density in many ways. The most important citywide projects -- successes like New York and Shenzhen -- show even more clearly how influential human intention can be. The developing world can accommodate the urban population growth and declining urban density in many ways. One is to have a threefold increase in the average population of its existing cities and a six fold increase in their average built-out area. Another, which will leave the built-out area of existing cities unchanged, will be to develop 625 new cities of 10 million people -- 500 new cities to accommodate the net increase in the urban population and another 125 to accommodate the 1.25 billion people who will have to leave existing cities as average density falls by half.;"Fuller, Brandon

handle:10986/18745;Housing and Urbanization in Africa : Unleashing a Formal Market Process;;The accumulation of decent housing matters both because of the difference it makes to living standards and because of its centrality to economic development. The consequences for living standards are far-reaching. In addition to directly conferring utility, decent housing improves health and enables children to do homework. It frees up women's time and enables them to participate in the labor market. More subtly, a home and its environs affect identity and self-respect. Commentary on the emergence of an African middle class has become common, but it is being defined in terms of discretionary spending and potential for consumer markets. A politically more salient definition of a middle class will be in terms of home ownership and the consequent stake in economic stability. This paper examines why such a process has not happened in Africa. The hypothesis is that the peculiarity of housing exposes it to multiple points of vulnerability not found together either in private consumer goods or in other capital goods. Each point of vulnerability can be addressed by appropriate government policies, but addressing only one or two of them has little payoff if the others remain unresolved. Further, the vulnerabilities faced by housing are the responsibility of distinct branches of government, with little natural collaboration. Unblocking multiple impediments to housing therefore requires coordination that can come only from the head of government: ministries of housing have neither the political weight nor the analytic capacity to play this role effectively. Yet in Africa, housing has never received such high political priority. This in turn is because the centrality of housing in well-being and of housing investment in development has not been sufficiently appreciated.;"Collier, Paul

handle:10986/18746;Urban Transport : Can Public-Private Partnerships Work?;;Cities exist, grow, and prosper because they take advantage of scale economies and specialization wrought by agglomeration. But output growth inevitably stresses transport infrastructure because production requires space and mobility. To prevent congestion from crowding out agglomeration benefits and to expand the supply of urban land, cities must invest in transport infrastructure. Yet balancing the growing demand for infrastructure with its supply is often difficult. In particular, many cities lack the funding to maintain and expand streets and urban highways. Also problematic is that roads are managed like a social service rather than subjected to market discipline. This leads to the central question of this chapter: Can public-private partnerships (PPPs) deal with these problems better than conventional public provision and ensure proper maintenance, timely expansion, and less congestion? And if so, how? To answer these questions, the paper examines what PPPs can do and what they need to work, focusing in particular on the role of institutions. This is followed by an investigation of common PPP pitfalls and the ways in which they can be avoided. The paper concludes with a case study of a successful transportation PPP in Chile that emphasizes the importance of planning.;"Engel, Eduardo

handle:10986/18747;Urbanization and the Geography of Development;;"This paper focuses on three interrelated questions on urbanization and the geography of development. First, although we herald cities with their industrial bases as ""engines of growth,"" does industrialization in fact drive urbanization? While such relationships appear in the data, the process is not straightforward. Among developing countries, changes in income or industrialization correlate only weakly with changes in urbanization. This suggests that policy and institutional factors may also influence the urbanization process. In fact, the relationship between industrialization and urbanization is absent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, do development policies have a big-city bias and, if so, what does this imply for growth and inequality? Intelligent public infrastructure investment inevitably involves picking winners. One hopes that such choices are based on market indicators, such as where industry is starting to agglomerate and where there are clear needs. Yet governments seem to favor the biggest cities which in turn draw firms and migrants to these cities. To try to avoid excessive in-migration and oversized, congested cities, favored cities might adopt policies that make living conditions for migrants more unpleasant. This can result in increased inequality and social tension. Finally, the paper examines city sizes and city-size distributions. Factors determining both aspects are complex and poorly understood. It is hard to be proscriptive about either individual city sizes or overall city-size distributions. The best policies strengthen institutions in the relevant markets so that market forces can move the economy toward better outcomes.";Henderson, J.

handle:10986/18748;Sustainable and Smart Cities;;This paper explores the challenges and opportunities that government officials face in designing coherent 'rules of the game' for achieving urban sustainability during times of growth. Sustainability is judged by three criteria. The first involves elements of day-to-day quality of life, such as having clean air and water and green space. The provision of these public goods has direct effects on the urban public's health and productivity. The second focuses on the city's greenhouse gas emissions. Developing cities are investing in new infrastructure, from highways and public transit systems to electricity generation and transmission. They are building water treatment, water delivery, and sewage disposal systems. Residents of these cities are simultaneously making key decisions about where they live and work and whether to buy such energy-consuming durables as private vehicles and home air-conditioning units. Given the long-lived durability of the capital stock, short-term decisions will have long-term effects on the city's carbon footprint. The third criterion is a city's resilience to natural disasters and extreme weather events. This subsection focuses on how the urban poor can be better equipped to adapt to the anticipated challenges of climate change.;Kahn, Matthew E.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-05-31;en;"climate change;land use;natural disasters;property rights;sustainable development;transaction costs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18748;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/18748/1/WPS6878.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/18748/WPS6878.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;;
handle:10986/18749;The Great Migration : Urban Aspirations;;The great 21st-century migration into cities will present both a great challenge for humanity and a significant opportunity for global economic growth. This paper describes the diverse patterns that define this metropolitan migration. It then lays out a framework for understanding the costs and benefits of new arrivals through migration's externalities and the challenges and policy tradeoffs that confront city stakeholders. The paper concludes by suggesting ways municipalities, by optimizing flexibility, can make migration more productive and less destructive in shaping the 'good city' and the 'smart city.' There are few paths to global economic growth that do not run through cities, and even fewer that do not depend on growing the city in population size, scale, and economic exchange. Historically, cities have grown by concentrating the economic advantages of number and density, the social potential of innovation, and the cultural possibilities of newness. By bringing together the factors of production, land, labor, capital, and enterprise, in ever more recombinant forms, cities offer the possibility of securing new economic advantages and scaling them up.;Keith, Michael;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-05-31;en;"eviction;housing rights;informal settlements;land speculation;land tenure;land use;occupation;property rights;slums;sustainable development;urban areas;urbanization;zoning";"Urban Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land & Investments";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18749;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/18749/1/WPS6879.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/18749/WPS6879.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;;
handle:10986/18753;Housing Matters;;Housing matters to the livability of cities and to the productivity of their economies. The failure of cities to accommodate the housing needs of growing urban populations can be seen in the proliferation of poorly serviced, high-density informal settlements. Such settlements are not new in the history of rapidly growing cities, their persistence results as much from policies as from economics and demographic transition. Slums have attracted most of the attention on urban housing in developing countries, and the Millennium Development Goals have given prominence to their reduction. However, urban housing issues transcend conditions in slums and are linked closely to economic activity. City economies influence housing demand, and in turn the flexibility of housing supply affects economic activity and city growth. This paper provides an overview of the policy and institutional building blocks that determine housing sector performance, drawing on studies from both developed and developing countries. It focuses on property rights, including tenure choice, housing finance, and subsidies. It also reviews the factors that affect supply: the availability of serviced land, as well as land and housing regulations. While these elements have been standard tools of housing policy, they are still the subject of considerable debate over their sequencing, policy content, and priority. There has been a great deal of emphasis over the last two decades on demand-side measures to improve property rights systems, develop housing finance, and even to introduce new subsidy systems. All these developments are important, but as this paper argues, less progress has been made in understanding and addressing the factors that constrain supply, which often thwart improvements on the demand side.;Hammam, Sonia;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-05-31;en;"eviction;informal settlements;land tenure;land use;slums;transaction costs;urban planning;urbanization;zoning";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";419;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18753;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/18753/1/WPS6876.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/18753/WPS6876.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;;

handle:10986/19393;Seeing is Believing? Evidence from an Extension Network Experiment;;Extension services are a keystone of information diffusion in agriculture. This paper exploits a large randomized controlled trial to track diffusion of a new technique in the classic Training and Visit (T&V) extension model, relative to a more direct training model. In both control and treatment communities, contact farmers (CFs) serve as points-of-contacts between agents and other farmers. The intervention (Treatment) aims to address two pitfalls of the T&V model: i) infrequent extension agent visits, and ii) poor quality information. Treatment CFs receive a direct, centralized training. Control communities are exposed to the classic T&V model. Information diffusion was tracked through two nodes: from agents to CFs, and from CFs to others. Directly training CFs leads to large gains in information diffusion and adoption, and CFs learn by doing. Diffusion to others is limited: other males adopt the technique perceived as labor saving, with an effect size of 75 percent.;"Kondylis, Florence

handle:10986/21003;Does Urbanization Affect Rural Poverty? Evidence from Indian Districts;;Although a high rate of urbanization and a high incidence of rural poverty are two distinct features of many developing countries, there is little knowledge of the effects of the former on the latter. Using a large sample of Indian districts from the 1983–1999 period, we find that urbanization has a substantial and systematic poverty-reducing effect in the surrounding rural areas. The results obtained through an instrumental variable estimation suggest that this effect is causal in nature and is largely attributable to the positive spillovers of urbanization on the rural economy rather than to the movement of the rural poor to urban areas. This rural poverty-reducing effect of urbanization is primarily explained by increased demand for local agricultural products and, to a lesser extent, by urban-rural remittances, the rural land/ population ratio, and rural nonfarm employment.;"Cali, Massimiliano

In many countries across the world, the growth of cities has stimulated the establishment and expansion of productive businesses by reducing the distance between suppliers and customers. The growth of cities has also facilitated provision of social services and infrastructure through economies of scale. These positive effects from urbanization are already visible in Uganda since the poverty rate is seven percentage points lower in urban areas than in rural areas. Most of the recent job creation is found in cities, and social indicators are also better in urban areas, especially in education and health.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-02-28;en;"agriculture;land markets;land policies;land use;urban areas;urbanization";"Land & Investments;Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"002;UGA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/21690;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/21690/1/946220WP0Box380Update050main0report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/21690/946220WP0Box380Update050main0report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

It also aims to encourage peer exchange of regional knowledge, specifically by encouraging dialogue on past experiences, lessons learned, optimal use of these financial tools, and the effect these tools may have on the execution of post-disaster funds. The Solomon Islands is located in an area known for frequent tropical cyclones and is also in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an active seismic area. Consequently, it is exposed to both hydrometeorological and geophysical hazards. This exposure was clearly demonstrated at the end of December 2012, when the country experience Tropical Cyclone Freda, followed in early February 2013 by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami affecting the Santa Cruz Islands. The Solomon Islands is expected to incur, over the long term, average annual losses of SI$145 million (US$20 million) due to earthquakes or tropical cyclones. In the next 50 years, the Solomon Islands has a 50 percent chance of experiencing a single event loss exceeding SI$1.7 billion (US$240 million), and a 10 percent chance of experiencing a single event loss exceeding SI$3.7 billion (US$520 million) (PCRAFI 2011).;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-02-28;en;"climate change;natural disasters;natural disasters;capacity building;land use";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;SLB";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/21693;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/21693/1/949830WP0P13240Note0Solomon0Islands.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/21693/949830WP0P13240Note0Solomon0Islands.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/21854;Global Experiences with Special Economic Zones;Focus on China and Africa;"This study briefly summarizes the development experiences of special economic zones in China and Africa, the lessons that Africa can learn from China, and the preliminary results of the Chinese investments in special economic zones in Africa. The study makes recommendations on how to unleash the power of special economic zones and industrial zones in Africa through strategically leveraging the Chinese experiences. The success factors of Chinese special economic zones include the strong and long-term commitment of the government, a conducive business environment in the zones, strategic locations, technology upgrading and skills training, and strong linkages with the local economy. However, the Chinese experiences highlight some pitfalls to avoid, such as the “mushroom approach” and high-level overlaps at the later stage, environmental degradation, and the unbalance between industrial development and social dimensions. This calls for a bigger role for the market. Sub-Sahara Africas experience with traditional economic zones has been relatively poor, except in a few countries, such as Mauritius. The key challenges include the poor regulatory and institutional framework, lack of effective strategic planning, weak governance and implementation capacity, and inadequate infrastructure, among others. Since 2006, China has implemented special economic zone projects globally, including in four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is still too early to conduct a full assessment of these projects; however, the evidence shows that some zones have begun to attract investments and make important contributions to the local economy. The main challenges include access to land, regulatory barriers, resettlement and coordination issues, and lack of external infrastructure.";Zeng, Douglas Zhihua;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-04-30;en;"urbanization;property rights;research;land use;climate change;property;environment;land";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;030;009;CHN";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/21854;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/21854/2/WPS7240.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/21854/WPS7240.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/21883;Environmental and Social Policy and Procedures;Volume 1. Department of Power, Nagaland;The North Eastern Region (NER) in India is endowed with rich energy resources but faces significant bottlenecks in electricity access and availability levels. The per capita power consumption in NER is one-third of the national average. The region has a shortfall of about 500MW installed capacity against peak demand of about 1950 MW. No significant generation capacity has been added in the recent past. Therefore, inadequate power supply continues a critical constraint to sustainable growth and economic development in the NER. Some states are generally not able to draw even their allocated share of power from the Central Generating Stations (CGS) through the grid due to poor/inadequate intra/interstate transmission and distribution network and no capacity addition towards transmission/distribution power system not done due to fund constraints. The transmission and distribution (T&D) losses are also quite high (up to 50%) across most of the States as a large number of remote hilly areas are connected through long low tension lines, resulting in low voltages and poor quality of power at consumer end. While generation capacity addition of about 4000 MW program over present installed capacity is already underway, adequate transmission and distribution infrastructure to transmit and distribute this power to consumers within the North-Eastern States is the need of the day.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-04-30;en;"sustainable development;forestry;land use;climate change;deforestation;land area;agriculture;property;environment;common property;forest land;land;indigenous peoples;land management";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"145;015";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/21883;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/21883/1/Environmental00rocedures000Nagaland.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/21883/Environmental00rocedures000Nagaland.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/22052;Metropolitan Governance in Brazil;Inputs for an Agenda and Strategy;"In less than fifty years, Brazil evolved from a predominantly rural society and economy to a highly urbanized country in which 85 percent of its people now live in urban areas and more than 90 percent of the country’s GDP is generated in the cities. This rapid urbanization process was characterized by a lack of planning and an enduring framework of inequality, resulting in high degrees of concentrated poverty in the urban areas. Much of this urbanization has taken place in metropolitan regions (MRs). MRs have grown more rapidly than the rest of the country, both in population and in GDP terms. In 2010, per capita GDP was higher in MRs than in the rest of the country and metropolitan economies accounted for 70 percent of GDP. At the same time, half of the Brazilian poor and 90 percent of the people living in subnormal conditions were found in metropolitan regions. The recent approval of a new framework for metropolitan governance inBrazil creates the opportunity for debate and evolution regarding several key issues. These include: a) placing metropolitan matters at the forefront of the development arena in Brazil; b) reviewing what has been learned about inter-municipal governance and service delivery; c) estimating resource mobilization needs for metropolitan development; d) coordinating metropolitan land use with transport and housing; e) including metropolitan concerns in any revision of fiscal federalism; and f) promoting environmental sustainability, social inclusion and resilience to disasters and climate change plans at the metropolitan scale. The World Bank can be a partner in addressing these issues. In responding to client demand, the Bank has been providing a range of support to Brazilian states and cities and especially their low- income populations in the areas of infrastructure, social services, slum upgrading, institutional development, river basin management, local economic development, environmental protection, water and sanitation, and transportation.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-05-29;en;"urbanization;land use;climate change;property;land;decentralization";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";Land Use, Management & Investment;BRA;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/22052;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/22052/1/Final0report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/22052/Final0report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/22277;Tanzania;Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment;This study aims to achieve a better understanding of the agricultural risk and risk management situation in Tanzania with a view to identifying key solutions to reduce current gross domestic product (GDP) growth volatility. For the purpose of this assessment, risk is defined as the probability that an uncertain event will occur that can potentially produce losses to participants along the supply chain. Persistence of unmanaged risks in agriculture is a cause of great economic losses for farmers and other actors along the supply chains (for example, traders, processors, and exporters), affecting export earnings and food security. The agricultural sector risk assessment is a straightforward methodology based on a three-phase sequential process. Phase analyzes the chronological occurrence of inter-seasonal agricultural risks with a view to identify and prioritize the risks that are the drivers of agricultural GDP volatility. This report contains the findings and recommendations of the first phase and includes the identification, analysis, and prioritization of major risks facing the agricultural sector in Tanzania, as well as recommendations regarding key solutions. Chapter one gives introduction and context. Chapter two contains an overview of the agricultural sector and its performance, as well as a discussion of key agro-climatic, weather, and policy restrictions and opportunities. Chapter three includes an assessment of major risks (that is, production, market, and enabling environment risks) facing key export and food crops. Chapter four presents an estimate of historical losses due to realized production risks and a correlation of such losses with production volatility. Chapter five provides insights into the exposure to risks by different stakeholders and their actual capacities, vulnerabilities, and potential to manage agricultural risks. Chapter six presents a risk prioritization by different supply chains and discusses the possible solutions, as well as specific recommendations for the agricultural sector development program (ASDP).;"Arce, Carlos E.

handle:10986/22402;Cambodia;Overview of a Cambodian Seed Sector;"The use of quality seed is a major component of increased yields in crop production. Quality seed and seed programs in a country does not emerge by happenstance; it is created by a combination of many factors that include variety development, seed production, quality control, processing, marketing, and governmental oversight. As the seed sector in a country matures, each of these factors becomes more important and plays a more important role in the growth of the agricultural sector. The seed program in Cambodia is interestingly different from that in many other developing countries. Even without a true seed program in Cambodia, farmers understand the need to plant quality seed to increase crop yields. When structuring this growing seed industry, it is important to look at current practices and to incorporate these practices into programs. Since a major thrust of the seed program in Cambodia involves rice, it is important to consider its role in the average Cambodian’s life. Cambodia’s climate must also be accounted for in any decisions regarding seed. Its heat and humidity causes rapid deterioration of seed viability and germination in rice and other seeds in both the growth and storage phases. CARDI research has shown that the level of rice germination falls below 80-85 percent within 6-8 months after harvest; this means that seed must be planted during the growing season following harvest. Therefore, any seed produced beyond immediate planting needs for the next crop is used for milling; seed production costs for that seed cannot be recouped. When seed producers’ budgets are constrained, they often plan their seed production based on conservative seed sales estimates.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-05-11;en;"farmers;food security;fisheries;contract farming";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;KHM";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/22402;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/22402/1/Cambodia000Ove0ambodian0seed0secort.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/22402/Cambodia000Ove0ambodian0seed0secort.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Rules, responsibilities and operational procedures need clarification, ideally guided by the findings of a fiscal disaster risk assessment. Insurance mechanisms are not considered in (sovereign) catastrophe risk transfer so far. Additional investment in and guidance with data market infrastructure would be necessary for sovereign DRM but would also benefit the spread of catastrophe property insurance for households, businesses and even low income populations who are beginning to see flood micro-insurance. With the public private agriculture insurance company, Senegal has a unique partner for rural outreach that could go beyond agriculture insurance. But the company would require technical support to achieve sustainability and find its role in the social protection framework. There is a unique window of opportunity for micro-insurance in Senegal as specific regulation is being implemented. This has generated momentum that can significantly grow the outreach of insurance but calls for technical and financial support. The most immediate opportunities for promising multi stakeholder interventions in Senegal are in agriculture insurance, where various initiatives have begun specifying the potential.

handle:10986/22509;Cambodia;The Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Roads Sectors -- Public Expenditure Review;This report focuses on areas with highest potential efficiency gains to increase the value for money from investments in core public goods and services such as extension, irrigation and rural roads. This is a first attempt to carry out such an analysis in Cambodia, and even in the Greater Mekong sub-region. Based on extensive data gathering and surveys, this chapter analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural sector expenditures in Cambodia and assesses various options for increasing the impact of government expenditures on agricultural growth. Other challenges include an excessive focus on rehabilitating primary irrigation infrastructure and a neglect of secondary and tertiary systems, a lack of maintenance of irrigation and rural roads, and the slow pace of developing or adopting new technologies to reduce future maintenance costs. There is also a need to better prioritize agricultural and related infrastructure expenditures, both by type and by geographic location, to maximize their impact on growth. The rest of the report is organized as follows. Chapter two presents recent developments in the agriculture sector of Cambodia. Chapter three gives an overview of sectoral expenditure trends over the last decade. The budget process and its relationship to sectoral development strategies is discussed in chapter three. Chapter four discusses the novel contribution of the AgPER in analyzing the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending using benefit-cost analysis to examine select public investments. Chapter five discusses how likely climate change trends may affect future agriculture expenditures and suggests some priority areas for public spending.

Physical infrastructure had been largely destroyed. United Nations intervention led to a peace agreement in 1991, a new constitution, elections, and formation of a coalition government, although a reduced level of conflict and political instability continued until the late 1990s. The government began a process of economic liberalization in the late 1980s which has been sustained. The donor world responded rapidly to Cambodia’s huge resource need with a high level of concessional aid which has been sustained. Since the mid-1990s the economy has been growing steadily; by 2006, per-capita incomes were double the 1998 level and the incidence of poverty had been significantly reduced. Social indicators have improved, generally to above the average for low-income countries, but are still well below those for most Southeast Asian countries.

The reform aims to increase specialization and balance out the uneven workload of judges by merging courts. This reform memorandum highlights potential reform opportunities in the areas covered by the doing business project that will allow the government to have a direct impact on business conditions by addressing some of these shortcomings through legal, regulatory, or administrative reforms.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-05-31;en;"conflict of interest;corruption;property rights";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150;HRV;143";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/22805;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/22805/1/Croatia000Doin0s0reform0memorandum.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/22805/Croatia000Doin0s0reform0memorandum.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/22904;Moldova Financial Sector Assessment Program;Insolvency and Creditor/Debtor Regimes--Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes;The World Bank assessed the insolvency and creditor or debtor regimes (ICR) of Moldova pursuant to the joint international monetary fund (IMF) and World Bank initiative on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC). The Moldovan authorities have made remarkable progress over the last decade in taking on board a broad range of reform related to the commercial law regime, including the laws pertaining to creditor protection and insolvency. Loans are often over collateralized, reducing available credit and increasing the incentives for lenders to rely primarily on their collateral for repayment rather than to support restructuring efforts. The secured transactions regime requires improvement, importantly regarding the facilitation of important credit instruments over category of assets. The rules aimed at encouraging good corporate behavior at times of financial distress may be improved and obstacles on insolvency filing by creditors removed to ensure timely filing of insolvency proceedings. There are also certain risks to creditor rights, including through abuse of the process by other creditors, which may disincentive the use of the system. The insolvency regime is now much more modern, but it has implementation problems, and some aspects of the law may require strengthening, including the cumbersome criteria for initiating insolvency proceedings by creditors, the lack of rules that incentivize new lending to the business in insolvency, the rules regarding transaction avoidance, due process aspects and some other rules adversely affecting creditor rights, the law and practice concerning the use of encumbered assets, and the decision-making process during insolvency especially in a restructuring context. The recommendations in this report are presented with the hope that they will assist the authorities in their continuing efforts to enhance the country’s legal and regulatory framework for enterprise credit.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-12-31;en;corruption;;;"150;MDA;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/22904;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/22904/1/Moldova000Fina00standards0and0codes.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/22904/Moldova000Fina00standards0and0codes.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/23106;Cote d'Ivoire;From Crisis to Sustained Growth -- Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity;"This systematic country diagnostic is structured in two main parts, one backward looking and the other forward looking. The backward-looking analysis aims to draw lessons on the determinants of poverty and sustainable and inclusive growth from (a) stakeholder consultations; (b) a poverty profile; (c) a jobs profile; and (d) a review of Cote d’Ivoire’s experience, and a comparison with Ghana and Sri Lanka, countries with similarities to Côte d’Ivoire, but with different growth trajectories. The poverty analysis shows that over the past 25 years, poverty has deepened considerably, in particular in rural areas in the North and West. While the fall in cocoa prices played an important role, consequences of the price shock were amplified by political and social crisis and cuts in social expenditure. The main employment challenge faced by Cote d’Ivoire is a high concentration of employment in low-productivity occupations, such as agricultural and non-agricultural self-employment, particularly among the poor, women and those living in rural areas. Very few individuals hold formal wage jobs, and those who do are concentrated among the more educated in urban areas. In the near- and medium term, job creation will benefit significantly from growth in the self-employment and micro-enterprise sectors. The analysis concludes that Cote d’Ivoire’s poor performance can be attributed to its response regarding four sets of policy issues: (a) lack of agricultural development and diversification; (b) lack of structural transformation into agro-business and non-agrobusiness led by the private sector; (c) inequitable social policies; and (d) lack of good governance. Based on this analysis, the forward-looking part outlines Côte d’Ivoire’s strategic pathways out of poverty, better jobs creation through private sector-led growth and human capital development, and the prerequisites for achieving those goals. For better jobs creation, the main pathways are increased agricultural productivity and diversification into agribusiness and other types of industries. Addressing constraints under these pathways, in particular access to finance, will also promote microenterprises and self-employment. For human capital development, the main pathways are increased and higher quality social spending and an effective social safety net.

handle:10986/23113;Madagascar;Systematic Country Diagnostic;This document is hence organized not around the three types of challenges, but around five themes of governance, public finance issues, private sector-led economy, poverty and environment, and human capital, all crucial to achieving faster, more inclusive and sustainable growth. Chapter one provides the country context. Chapter two discusses the quality of governance, an overarching issue in Madagascar. It has a direct bearing on the pace, the inclusiveness and sustainability of growth. While acknowledging the importance of improving governance for Madagascar, which is a difficult, medium term undertaking, this Systematic Country Diagnostic argues that progress is also possible. Chapter three discusses how amelioration in managing public finances, and increasing revenue in particular, could be used as a lens for improved governance. Chapter four discusses the role and challenges of the private sector, the main driver of growth. Chapter five discusses the challenges for achieving higher human capital in a country with a very young population and some of the highest infant stunting and malnourishment rates in the world. Chapter six discusses the faces of poverty, which are predominantly rural, agricultural and informal. A structural transformation has not started in Madagascar and poverty and environment are closely intertwined. The chapter also discusses the challenges to enhancing the management of natural resources and protecting the poor from natural disasters and impacts of climate change. Chapter seven summarizes the challenges and prioritizes the reforms.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-08-25;en;"property rights;sustainable development;land degradation;forestry;land use;climate change;deforestation;property;environment;fisheries;land";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;MDG";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/23113;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/23113/1/Madagascar000S0c0country0diagnostic.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/23113/Madagascar000S0c0country0diagnostic.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/23350;Kenya;Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment;Despite myriad challenges, Kenya has emerged in recent years as one of Africa’s frontier economies, with headline growth in the most recent decade propelling the country toward middle-income status. Less well understood is how risk dynamics associated with production, markets, and policy adversely impact sector performance, in terms of both influencing ex ante decision making among farmers, traders, and other sector stakeholders and causing ex post losses to crops, livestock, and incomes - destabilizing livelihoods and jeopardizing the country’s food security. The present study was commissioned in part to bridge this knowledge gap. It is the first step in a multiphase process designed to integrate a stronger risk focus into sector planning and development programs. It seeks to learn from and build on a range of broad initiatives by the Government of Kenya (GoK) and its development partners purposed to enhance Kenya’s resilience and response to natural disasters. The ultimate objective is implementation of a holistic and systematic risk management system that will reduce the vulnerability and strengthen the resiliency of Kenya’s agricultural supply chains, and the livelihoods that depend on them. This sector risk assessment is the primary output of phase one. The study’s main objective is to identify, assess, and prioritize principal risks facing Kenya’s agriculture sector by analyzing their impacts via quantitative and qualitative measures. The study’s main findings highlight an agriculture sector increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather variability. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two provides an overview of Kenya’s agriculture sector and a discussion of key growth constraints. Chapter three assesses the main agricultural risks (production, market, and enabling environment). Chapter four analyzes the frequency and severity of the major risks identified and assesses their impact. Chapter five presents some stakeholder perceptions of these risks and the potential to improve their management. Chapter six concludes with an assessment of priorities for risk management and a broad discussion of possible risk management measures that can help to strengthen the resiliency of agricultural supply chains and the livelihoods they support.;"D’Alessandro, Stephen P.

handle:10986/23473;Maternal and Child Health Inequalities in Ethiopia;;Recent surveys show considerable progress in maternal and child health in Ethiopia. The improvement has been in health outcomes and health services coverage. The study examines how different groups have fared in this progress. It tracked 11 health outcome indicators and health interventions related to Millennium Development Goals 1, 4, and 5. These are stunting, underweight, wasting, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, under-five mortality, measles vaccination, full immunization, modern contraceptive use by currently married women, antenatal care visits, and skilled birth attendance. The study explores trends in inequalities by household wealth status, mothers’ education, and place of residence. It is based on four Demographic and Health Surveys implemented in 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2014. Trends in rate differences and rate ratios are analyzed. The study also investigates the dynamics of inequalities, using concentration curves for different years. In addition, a decomposition analysis is conducted to identify the role of proximate determinants. The study finds substantial improvements in health outcomes and health services. Although there still exists a considerable gap between the rich and the poor, the study finds some reductions in inequalities of health services. However, some of the improvements in selected health outcomes appear to be pro-rich.;"Ambel, Alemayehu

handle:10986/2398;Low-Carbon Development for Mexico;;One of the most compelling reasons for pursuing low-carbon development is that the potential impacts of climate change are predicted to be severe, for both industrial and developing countries, and that reducing greenhouse gas emissions can reduce the risk of the most catastrophic impacts. The challenge of reducing emissions is sobering: leading scientific models indicate that limiting the rise in global mean temperatures to less than two degree Celsius will require that global greenhouse gas emissions peak within the next 10-15 years and then fall by 2050 to levels about 50 percent lower than in 1990. Although many countries recognize the need to curtail carbon emissions, there is considerable uncertainty about how much this will cost in individual countries, what measures can be undertaken in both the short and longer term, and how cost-effective specific interventions are in reducing emissions. This study analyzes a range of energy efficiency options available in Mexico, including supply-side efficiency improvements in the electric power and oil and gas industries, and demand-side electricity efficiency measures addressing high-growth energy-consuming activities, such as air conditioning and refrigeration. It also evaluates a range of renewable energy options that make use of the country's vast wind, solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal resources.;"Johnson, Todd M.

Climate change is placing further strains on the city’s ability to manage the urban environment. The urban environmental profile of eThekwini has been prepared as the first component of the assignment promoting green urban development in Africa: enhancing the relationship between urbanization, environmental assets and ecosystem services, a project being conducted under the leadership of the World Bank. An overall objective of this project is to link the study of urban environmental issues with the advancement of more sustainable urban growth. The profile summarizes the existing quality of the terrestrial and other aquatic environmental assets, identifies the key drivers that are the cause of their vulnerability, and describes the key institutional challenges and constraining factors that limit the city’s ability to address environmental management challenges. Identification of the key environmental assets and key drivers of environmental degradation within the city required a more comprehensive review of reports on urban planning and infrastructure services. The urban environmental profile is organized as follows: section one gives introduction. Section two, eThekwini context, sets the background, and context of the study of Durban, providing an overview of the impacts of urbanization and climate change and drawing the link to the urban environment. Section three, quality of the environmental assets of eThekwini describes the state of the key environmental assets of eThekwini: the terrestrial assets, aquatic assets, coastal assets, and the air, and attempts to infer the associated historic and current trends. Section four, drivers of environmental vulnerability and degradation describes the key issues that are driving degradation, the impacts caused, and the reason for these challenges.

handle:10986/24058;Romania Toward a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy;Urban Sector Analysis;By European standards, Romania is a low urbanized country. There exists a rising trend towards suburbanization, however, that is not fully captured by Romania’s urban statistics. The country’s urbanization rate of 55 percent has remained fairly constant over the past two decades, despite significant population migration out of the country, and a strong suburbanization trend in areas on the immediate outskirts of major cities. Because central government demographers still categorize some of these regions outside of the urban core as rural, this shift has not yet made its way into the official population statistics. If this were to happen, the urbanization rate could rise to 65 percent. The objective of the urban sector analysis was to provide insights to the Romanian Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests (MEWF) on opportunities to change the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Romanian cities, using the Bucharest–Ilfov metropolitan region (BIMR) as an example.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-01-31;en;"waste;climate change;land use planning;environment";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143;ROU";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24058;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24058/1/Romania000Towa0te0resilient0economy.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24058/Romania000Towa0te0resilient0economy.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24059;Romania Toward a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy;Transport Sector Analysis;In Romania, as well as in many other East European countries, transport sector Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are increasing fast and their growth is expected to continue into the future, accompanying the on-going economic convergence with the European Union (EU). The objective of the analysis was to assess the impact of green policies and investments on transport emissions. For this purpose, the Romania Transport Strategic Emission Prediction Tool (TRANSEPT) was developed. The outcome of the analysis is a set of proposed green measures, their cost (investment and operational), and their abatement potential. The findings show that Green interventions in Romania lead to a significant reduction of GHG emissions growth as compared with the Baseline and to a gradual decoupling of transport sector emissions growth from economic growth, thus achieving the goal of transport sector mitigation. The main modeling outcomes include abatement potential, cost, and the cost effectiveness (cost per unit of abatement) of the selected green interventions for the period 2015-2050. Financing needs for the recommended measures in transport rise sharply between the Green and the Super Green scenarios, but still remain modest, as incremental investments within a large sector. As the last step of the analysis, a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) provided a framework to present the outcomes of the transport sector analysis in a form useful for policy discussions. As Romania’s motorization rate converges with that of the EU, transport emissions are expected to grow even if green measures in the sector are implemented. To conclude, the proposed mitigation action plan recommends a set of actions on the basis of the estimates made in this assessment where institutional arrangement and coordination are also critical.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-22;en;"land use;climate change;urban areas";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143;ROU";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24059;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24059/1/Romania000Towa0port0sector0analysis.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24059/Romania000Towa0port0sector0analysis.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24060;Romania Toward a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy;Energy Sector Analysis;"This report is about Energy sector in Romania which is responsible for 58 percent of the country’s GHG emissions (except Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)), and is therefore critical for mitigation. Romania’s economic growth and energy consumption have been decoupling since the early 1990s, and the energy intensity of the economy has been continuously decreasing, but it is still high. At present, Romanian energy supply system is relatively carbon intensive, but share of zero-carbon energy sources is growing. The energy sector analysis and modeling were designed to find the best solutions for Romania’s energy supply mix given the country’s prospective medium- and long-term climate change mitigation obligations. The key findings were as follows: (i) energy efficiency measures will contain energy demand growth; (ii) as a result of the new investments in the energy sector under the Green and the Super Green scenarios, primary energy supply mix will become cleaner. Under the Baseline scenario; (iii) new investments in the electricity sector will lead to a much cleaner electricity supply mix; (iv) total costs for the energy system are lower under the Green scenario then in the Baseline, but the Super Green mitigation targets require an expense equal to the Baseline one; (v) electricity sector GHG emissions in 2050 are 72 percent and 97 percent below the 2005 level under the Green and Super Green scenarios, respectively; (vi) GHG emission from the energy supply system as a whole would be 25 percent and 50 percent below in 2030 from the 2005 level in the Green and Super green scenarios, respectively; and (vii) Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) shows that the proposed measures provide a significant potential abatement level totaling in 2050. The conclusions and recommendations were as follows: (a) Romania can meet the GHG mitigation obligations likely under the EU 2030 framework in energy and electricity sectors at moderate costs; (b) The prospective requirements of the EU 2050 Roadmap, which requires at least 80 percent reduction in emissions overall and the virtual elimination of emissions from the power sector, are both expensive and challenging to implement; (c) Implementation of a set of aggressive energy efficiency measures is a key part of the Green and the Super Green scenarios; (d) a lower carbon path for Romania’s energy sector imposes significant costs and complex planning challenges on the sector, in particular on power generation; (e) energy sector in Romania has the potential to become an engine of economic growth; (f) while this assessment included a set of generally-agreed technologies at costs based on today’s best analysis, both technologies and costs will surely evolve, and updated analysis will be needed; and (g) while long-term sector development to 2030 and 2050, the subject of this assessment, is important, the government cannot be distracted from critical near-term sector reforms.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-31;en;"waste;climate change";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"150;143;ROU";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24060;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24060/1/Romania000Towa0ergy0sector0analysis.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24060/Romania000Towa0ergy0sector0analysis.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24061;Romania Toward a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy;Benchmarking Study;"This report is about Romanis's Green growth benchmarking, which is a country-level diagnostic that helps define a country’s strengths and vulnerabilities in adopting a path to greener growth. The process of defining a country’s green growth path starts with an analysis aimed at mapping the country’s current position on a multi-dimensional green-growth chart, with each dimension defined by an indicator of green growth. A framework to define a list of questions key to understanding how Romania or any country compares in an international context is constructed with three considerations: “how green?,” “going green,” and “riding a green wave.” This framework is used to guide a benchmarking exercise that maps Romania against comparator countries and country groups using a dataset of more than 100 indicators for 69 countries. The following were the key findings: (i) Romania is well-endowed with natural resources, which, if used productively, can support strong and sustained economic growth; (ii) despite drastic improvements since the early 1990s, Romania’s economy has high intensity greenhouse gas emissions and high energy intensity. However, as a member of the European Union (EU) the country already faces obligations to reduce its emissions; (iii) making adaptations to protect tomorrow’s output from climate damage is also important for Romania, a country more vulnerable to climate change than others in the EU; and (iv) a greener world will require economic transition, and successful transformation will depend on the flexibility of the country’s economy--its ability to absorb shocks—and its readiness to take advantage of new opportunities. Romania does not appear ready to take advantage of new green opportunities: in research and development indicators and the innovation and knowledge economy, Romania lags far behind the EU. The following were the conclusions and recommendations: (i) this benchmarking exercise identified a selected set of issues within the broad green growth agenda which Romania should focus on as it considers how to move onto a greener growth path; and (ii) a country pursuing green growth might find regular benchmarking analysis of value in identifying emerging green issues.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-31;en;"climate change;environment;land;urban population";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";;"150;143;ROU";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24061;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24061/1/Romania000Towa000benchmarking0study.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24061/Romania000Towa000benchmarking0study.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24063;Romania Toward a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy;Forestry Sector Analysis;"This report is about forests that provide a substantial contribution to mitigation in Romania by sequestering carbon, helping to counter carbon emissions from other sectors in the economy. Sustainable forest management is challenged by fragmented ownership and insufficient financial resources in particular. A summary of key existing analytic studies, and the construction of a marginal abatement cost curve for mitigation actions in the forestry sector, was the basis for identifying key adaptation and mitigation measures for Romania’s forests. In addition to the national and international analytic exercises, a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) was estimated for three measures: afforestation, sustainable management of protection forests, and sustainable management of production forests. The key findings were as follows: (i) analysis of adaptation needs and mitigation possibilities found that forestry could provide cost-efficient abatement for Romania; and (ii) financing needs for the three priority measures, afforestation, sustainable management of protection forests, and sustainable management of production forests were evaluated. The conclusions and recommendations were as follows: (i) recommendations stress the importance of sustainable forest management for Romania and the European Union's (EU) desirability to move rapidly towards defining the rules for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) based mitigation within its 2030 framework; (ii) policy measures that mitigate climate change and contribute to growth are critical, as is capacity building; and (iii) a greener path for forests will require additional public spending.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-31;en;"climate change;forest management plans;land area;agriculture;forest land;land;land degradation;forestry;land ownership;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143;ROU";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24063;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24063/1/Romania000Towa0stry0sector0analysis.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24063/Romania000Towa0stry0sector0analysis.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

This complex reform, supported by the World Bank loan for Financial Services Development Project and the grants from the Swiss Office of International Cooperation (SECO), was launched in 2006 and helped the government of Azerbaijan to improve financial services delivery and inclusion in the country in parallel with modernizing and digitalizing Azerpost, expanding its financial services delivery capacity, enhancing its financial viability and maximizing the public value of Azerpost extensive branch network of 1,600 offices. In the period of 2007-1H2015, Azerpost total revenues, largely from financial services (as universal postal services remain loss-making) tripled, while volume of financial services’ sales increased four times. In 2015, Azerpost reached financial breakeven without state subsidy, and productivity of its staff increased 3 times. In 2009, Azerpost corporatized and became LLC, while in 2010, based on the new postal legislation, it was licensed as a non-bank financial institution subject to prudential supervision of the central bank.;"Prigozhina, Angela

With the opening of a new bank in 2014, there are now 14 commercial banks operating in Mali. There has been a positive evolution of the banking sector in Mali from 2009-13. There have been a number of changes in recent years in the ownership structure of the banking sector, which is now dominated by foreign shareholders, primarily from Africa. The emergence of WAEMU banking groups is a recent phenomenon, spurred in part by the approval of a single banking license for the sub-region. Available financial soundness indicators (FSI) suggest that the banking sector is generally sound, though performance varies widely among banks, and asset quality is weak.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-31;en;"property;land";;;"002;MLI";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24269;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24269/1/Mali000Financi0r0assessment0program.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24269/Mali000Financi0r0assessment0program.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24271;Mali Financial Sector Assessment Program;Legal and Judicial Aspects of the Credit Environment;A country’s legal and judicial environment can help or hinder access to credit. In addition to the banking law governing the organization of the sector, the operations of credit institutions are subject to several laws. Four components of Malian business law are particularly relevant in assessing the position of creditors, the law on secured transactions, the law on collective proceedings, the law on information-sharing related to debtors (sometimes called the credit reporting law), and the law on collection and enforcement proceedings. If creditors cannot have confidence in their legal environment, they will be inclined to lend only to persons they know well. In this regard, it is telling to note that in Mali, the 50 biggest clients account for 39.3 percent of the credit extended by banks (although this percentage has fallen in recent times). Furthermore, access to credit remains a major constraint in the Malian business world. Although the reasons are not confined solely to the legal sphere, it is important to point out that, according to the 2010 Enterprise Survey, Malian enterprises cited access to credit as the main constraint hampering the business environment (43.9 percent of enterprises). The same study showed that in the case of loans involving a security right, the value of the assets pledged stood at 201.4 percent of the amount borrowed, reflecting the lack of confidence by banks in their ability to actually enforce their rights. In addition, in view of the fact that 58 percent of loans require a pledged asset which, in most instances, takes the form of immovable property, persons who do not own such assets are, de facto, shut out of the system and unable to seek credit.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-31;en;"property;personal property;common law;land management";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"002;MLI";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24271;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24271/1/Mali000Legal0a0nment0technical0note.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24271/Mali000Legal0a0nment0technical0note.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24272;Mali Financial Sector Assessment Program;Agricultural Finance;The performance of the Malian economy is largely dependent on the performance of the agricultural sector. The overall good growth in the Malian economy over the last several years is attributed to the agricultural GDP growth. Since 1995, the economy grew at about 5 percent per year until 2010, but a global recession, the military coup and terrorist activity caused a noticeable slowdown in GDP to about 1.2 percent in 2011-2012. The economic growth has resumed at a slow pace since 2013 and is currently estimated around 4.5 percent for 2014-2015. Agricultural development in general and agricultural finance in particular is hampered by a lack of quality data on the sector. Although improving, reliable statistical information is still lacking in Mali. There are often inconsistencies in agricultural data presented in the various reports available in the country. Although data on the main food crops and cotton are readily available, quality information on the high potential value chains, like mango and meat and dairy value chains, is less frequently provided. The lack of quality agricultural statistics makes public planning and analysis difficult and deters private sector investment.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-12-31;en;"farmers;urban areas;property;land";;;"002;MLI";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24272;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24272/1/Mali000Agricul0nance0technical0note.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24272/Mali000Agricul0nance0technical0note.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24333;Competitiveness of South Asia’s Container Ports;A Comprehensive Assessment of Performance, Drivers, and Costs;"South Asia’s trade almost doubled in the past decade, but the share of trade in GDP is still smaller (47 percent) than in East Asia (55 percent), and South Asia’s economic competitiveness continues to lag that of other regions. Part of the problem is the region’s container ports. As a result of inefficiencies, the average cost of exporting or importing a container in the region is more than twice what it is in East Asia. Better port logistics could help increase trade, diversify exports, attract more foreign direct investment, and spur economic growth. As container traffic continues to grow and physical expansion is constrained by the limited supply of available land at most ports, the best way to improve port performance is by increasing productivity. To identify strategies for doing so, this report examines the performance of the 14 largest container ports in the region based on two sets of criteria: operational performance and economic performance. To measure operational performance, the report benchmarks total time at port, waiting time at port, and idle time as a share of total time at berth. To measure economic performance, it benchmarks productivity and efficiency using two useful techniques: Malmquist total factor productivity decomposition and data envelopment analysis. The report identifies key drivers of port performance and examines how differences in performance across ports are related to those drivers. This analysis is based on an original dataset on private sector participation, governance, and competition in South Asia’s container port sector. To highlight the potential gains from improving performance of container ports, the report uses econometric techniques to isolate the impact of efficiency improvements on maritime transport costs and trade. The results suggest that the best strategy for improving port performance in the region is a three-pronged approach that (a) encourages private sector participation through a well-developed enabling environment, including further adoption of the “landlord” port model; (b) strengthens the governance of port authorities’ boards; and (c) promotes competition between and within ports, in part through transparent and competitive concession bidding.";"Herrera Dappe, Matías

handle:10986/24584;Myanmar;Analysis of Farm Production Economics;"This report was prepared by the World Bank in partnership with the Livelihoods and Food Security Multi-Donor Trust Fund (LIFT). Both the World Bank and the LIFT are actively involved in supporting Myanmar’s agriculture sector given its significance in poverty reduction and food security, and they both consider the lack of reliable farm data to be a significant constraint to designing effective programs and policies. This report fills some of the data gaps. In addition to presenting the collected data, the report offers the first analysis of these data. It focuses on the assessment of the extent of crop diversification and an analysis of farm production economics, in particular (partial factor) productivity of agricultural land and labor and crop profitability. This focus was chosen to study Myanmar’s commercial production areas and to facilitate international comparisons, as most international studies follow a similar approach, focusing on advanced farmers in commercial production areas. The four main findings of the report are as follows: (i) Myanmar’s farming systems are diversified and during the monsoon season most farms produce paddy, during the cool and dry seasons most farms produce crops other than paddy, mainly beans and pulses, oilseeds, and maize; (ii) the analysis reconfirmed that agricultural productivity in Myanmar is low, irrespective of what indicators are used, limiting the sector’s contribution to poverty reduction and shared prosperity; (iii) low productivity is a result of multiple factors, many of them associated with the undersupply of quality public services such as research, extension, and rural infrastructure, in delivery of which the government has a key role to play; and (iv) going forward and given that paddy is less profitable and more costly to produce than other crops in most agro-ecological zones, especially during the cool and dry seasons, it is desirable to redesign public programs from exclusive support of paddy production to support for broad-based agricultural development.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-02-26;en;"farmers;food security;aquaculture;fisheries;contract farming;farming systems";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;MMR";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24584;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24584/1/Myanmar000Anal0production0economics.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24584/Myanmar000Anal0production0economics.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Achieving those goals requires a two pronged strategy of building on the strengths of past performance as well as introducing new elements. Progress in rural livelihoods drove poverty reduction in the past and will likely do so in the future. In addition, faster, and more inclusive, private sector-led structural change and ‘getting urbanization right’ are essential going forward. The report identifies two key challenges to sustainable progress: Ethiopia needs sustainably financed infrastructure that enables private investment to flourish and reduces reliance on public borrowing. It must also strengthen feedback mechanisms that inform policymakers of what works and what doesn’t so that the aspirations of a rapidly rising and better-educated working-age population can be met.

handle:10986/24694;Guatemala;Closing Gaps to Generate More Inclusive Growth;This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) looks at why a country with such great potential has not been able to materialize it. The SCD analysis has identified several knowledge gaps. The analysis in this report focuses on the 2000 to 2014 period, covering the boom years before 2008 and the global financial crisis and recovery years up to 2014. It is based on a rich household data set from the National Living Standards Measurement Survey (ENCOVI) as well as on data on malnutrition from the 2014 National Survey of Maternal and Child Indicators (ENSMI). Where relevant and where there are available data, longer times series have been constructed, but the focus of the report is on this 15-year period. The analysis has some limitations. The SCD team identified various countries that could be considered to be Guatemala’s peer and aspirational countries in terms of their income level and population size, and whenever it is relevant to do so, the report benchmarks Guatemala’s performance against the performance of those countries. The report is organized as follows: After the overview presented here in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 provides evidence of the trends in poverty, shared prosperity, and inequality in Guatemala. The first section benchmarks Guatemala’s progress in reducing income poverty against its peer countries. This is followed by an examination of consumption poverty, which is the official measure of poverty used in Guatemala. The analysis highlights the gaps between the two Guatemalas. The chapter ends with some findings concerning the drivers of poverty, specifically focusing on the roles played by prices, labor, and transfers. Chapter 3 attempts to answer the question of how inclusive economic growth has been in Guatemala, looking first at the limited role played by labor markets in helping people to rise out of poverty and at the limited human capital and the dearth of opportunities to increase it. The chapter then discusses the ineffective and inadequate public spending that rives these outcomes and demonstrates the link between limited opportunities and poor outcomes, focusing specifically on malnutrition and vulnerability. Chapter 4 analyzes the drivers of growth and the roles and characteristics of key sectors. Important changes in trade policies are then covered, and the chapter ends with a detailed discussion of the main constraints to increasing investment and productivity and to creating high-quality jobs. Chapter 5 focuses on various fiscal, environmental, and social challenges. Major concerns about tax revenues, water resources and land use are highlighted. The final chapter summarizes the priorities that have emerged from the analysis and describes a set of policies or areas of action that have the potential to put Guatemala on a path of higher and more inclusive growth.;"Sanchez, Susana M.

handle:10986/24697;Republic of Cameroon;Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity;Cameroon is a lower-middle income country with social indicators and levels of poverty which are below those for comparator countries. Large and rising inequalities between north and south, inefficiencies in public resource allocation and an adverse business environment explain this. While insecurity due to Boko Haram activities and rapidly rising public debt constrain efforts at poverty reduction, there exists a huge potential for economic growth and poverty reduction. This potential remains mostly untapped. Realizing it will require far reaching reforms, particularly with respect to the business environment and public financial management, and require politically courage to accomplish. The remainder of this document explores how to achieve the twin goals of ending poverty and improving shared prosperity by 2030 in a sustainable manner. The document identifies a limited number of binding constraints which would need to be lifted to achieve the poverty objective. The next four chapters present background material to chapter six, which presents binding constraints to poverty reduction. The micro-foundations to poverty reduction are discussed in chapters two and three. Chapter two discusses poverty, equity and vulnerability. Chapter three discusses human capital and its role in poverty reduction. Chapter four considers poverty reduction from a macro-economic perspective. It discusses opportunities for growth and economic transformation as well as the status of various cross-cutting economic services. Chapter five, considers governance, fragility and the institutional environment.

handle:10986/24705;Strengthening Competitiveness In Bangladesh—Thematic Assessment;A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study;"This is volume 2 of a three-volume publication on Bangladesh’s trade prospects. Bangladesh’s ambition is to build on its very solid growth and poverty reduction achievements, and accelerate growth to become a middle income country by 2021, and share prosperity more widely amongst its citizens. This includes one of its greatest development challenges: to provide gainful employment to the over 2 million people that will join the labor force each year over the next decade. Moreover, only 54.1 million of its 94 million working age people are employed. Bangladesh needs to use its labor endowment even more intensively to increase growth and, in turn, to absorb the incoming labor. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study identifies the following actions centered around four pillars to sustain and accelerate export growth: (1) breaking into new markets through a) better trade logistics to reduce delivery lags ; as world markets become more competitive and newer products demand shorter lead times, to generate new sources of competitiveness and thereby enable market diversification; and b) better exploitation of regional trading opportunities in nearby growing and dynamic markets, especially East and South Asia; (2) breaking into new products through a) more neutral and rational trade policy and taxation and bonded warehouse schemes; b) concerted efforts to spur domestic investment and attract foreign direct investment, to contribute to export promotion and diversification, including by easing the energy and land constraints; and c) strategic development and promotion of services trade; (3) improving worker and consumer welfare by a) improving skills and literacy; b) implementing labor and work safety guidelines; and c) making safety nets more effective in dealing with trade shocks; and (4) building a supportive environment, including a) sustaining sound macroeconomic fundamentals; and b) strengthening the institutional capacity for strategic policy making aimed at the objective of international competitiveness to help bring focus and coherence to the government’s reform efforts. This second volume provides in-depth analysis across seven cross-cutting themes that underpin most of the findings of pillars 1 and 2 above.";"Kathuria, Sanjay

handle:10986/24706;The Kurdistan Region of Iraq;Reforming the Economy for Shared Prosperity and Protecting the Vulnerable;The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is a constitutionally recognized semiautonomous region in northern Iraq. Its government, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), based in Erbil, has the right, under the Iraqi constitution of 2005, to exercise legislative, executive, and judicial powers according to the constitution, except in what is listed therein as exclusive powers of the federal authorities. The Iraqi constitution defines the Kurdistan Region as a federal entity of Iraq. KRG has a parliamentary democracy with a regional assembly that consists of 111 seats. KRI has been largely immune to the insecurity and conflict witnessed elsewhere in Iraq, especially following the 2003 Iraq War. KRG is facing a wide range of immediate and medium to longer-term challenges that are intrinsically linked to the overall macroeconomic situation of Iraq as well as the regional and global environment. The immediate challenge consists in coping with (a) the deep fiscal crisis, and (b) the security and social problems brought about by the conflict with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group and the resulting influx of Syrian refugees and Iraqi Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). These challenges are clearly immediate priorities for the KRG, and will bear significant repercussions nationally and internationally if inadequately addressed. The medium to longer-term challenges pertain to moderating dependence on the oil sector and transforming the KRI economy into a diversified one that supports private sector-led economic growth and job creation in a sustainable manner.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-05-30;en;"property rights;sustainable development;land use;climate change;property;transaction costs;environment;land";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IRQ;145;015";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24706;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24706/1/Main0report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24706/Main0report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24707;Sustaining the Success of the Systematic Land Tenure Registration in Rwanda;;Since 2010, the Government of Rwanda addressed land tenure through a series of actions including the establishment of institutional and administrative structures for land management and administration. At district, town, and municipality level, District Land Bureaus (DLBs), complemented by sector and cell level land committees, assumed responsibility for land administration and planning. After careful piloting in 2008/09, a process for systematic low cost demarcation and adjudication using aerial photography or high resolution satellite imagery was roll-out nationally. In less than 3 years, the Rwanda Natural Resource Authority (RNRA) demarcated 11.4 million out of an estimated 11.5 million land parcels in the country in a participatory way and at a unit cost of less than USD 6 per parcel (Nkurunziza 2015). Positive impacts at household levels were identified at various stages of the project implementation.;"Ali, Daniel

handle:10986/24708;Improving Sustainability of Land Administration through Decentralized Service Provision;Evidence from Rwanda;Recognizing that the impressive gains from comprehensive land tenure regularization may be short-lived if subsequent transactions are not registered, Rwanda has deployed close to 400 Sector Land Managers (SLMs) throughout the country. Regressions using LAIS data highlight that posting of SLMs increased levels of registered sales but not inheritance transactions and that, for agricultural land, having an SLM taken refresher training almost doubled this effect. A survey of all SLMs in April 2016 suggests that they are fully functional and in close contact with DLOs. More training (possibly via new channels), access to LAIS, and some office equipment (locking cabinets) could enhance performance. Time spent by SLMs on land administration, levels of transactions handled, and reasons for them to reject applications provide pointers for improvement.;"Ali, Daniel

handle:10986/24709;Quantifying Spillover Effects from Large Land-based Investment;The Case of Mozambique;Almost a decade after a spike in land demand following the 2007–08 commodity boom, evidence on impacts of this phenomenon remains limited and mostly case study based. We show that information on location and start data of large farms, combined with existing smallholder farm surveys, allows to complement this with a difference-in-difference approach to systematically assess spillovers from large farm establishment. Illustrative application to Mozambique suggests positive short-term effects from newly established large farms on adoption of agricultural practices and input use by small farms less than 50 km from newly established large operations. Robustness checks for crop farms only also suggest job creation in the proximity of newly established crop, but not livestock farms. Yet, large farm establishment decreased perceived well-being within a 25-km band and, in the time horizon considered here, did not lead to better access to output markets, cultivation of larger areas or, once other factors are controlled for, higher yields. This allows us to reject the notion of negative spillovers from large farm establishment but casts doubt on the wisdom of large unconditional subsidies to attract investors. In addition to drawing policy conclusions for Mozambique, we highlight the methodology’s wider applicability and scope for expansion.;"Deininger, Klaus

handle:10986/24715;Rules on Paper, Rules in Practice;Enforcing Laws and Policies in the Middle East and North Africa;The primary focus of this book is on a specific outcome of the rule of law: the practical enforcement of laws and policies, and the determinants of this enforcement, or lack thereof. Are there significant and persistent differences in implementation across countries? Why are some laws and policies more systematically enforced than others? Are “good” laws likely to be enacted, and if not, what stands in the way? We answer these questions using a theoretical framework and detailed empirical data and illustrate with case studies from Morocco, Tunisia and Jordan. We believe that the best way to understand the variation in the drafting and implementation of laws and policies is to examine the interests and incentives of those responsible for these tasks – policymakers and bureaucrats. If laws and their enforcement offer concrete benefits to these ruling elites, they are more likely to be systematically enforced. If they don't, implementation is selective, discretionary, if not nil. Our first contribution is in extending the application of the concept of the rule of law beyond its traditional focus on specific organizations like the courts and the police, to economic sectors such as customs, taxation and land inheritance, in a search for a direct causal relationship with economic development outcomes. Instead of limiting ourselves to a particular type of organization or a legalistic approach to the rule of law, we present a broader theory of how laws are made and implemented across different types of sectors and organizations. Our second contribution is in demonstrating how powerful interests affect implementation outcomes. The incentives elites have to build and support rule-of-law institutions derive from the distribution of power in society, which is partly a historical given. The point we make is that it is not deterministic. Realigning the incentive structures for reform among key actors and organizations, through accountability and competition, can dramatically improve the chances that rule-of-law institutions will take root. On the other hand, building the capacity of organizations without first changing institutional incentives is likely to lead to perverse outcomes.;"Al-Dahdah, Edouard

handle:10986/24722;Fecal Sludge Management;Diagnostics and Guidelines for Sservice Delivery in Urban Areas;Urban sanitation remains a significant challenge for most low- and middle-income countries. While sanitation coverage has been increasing across both the 48 least developed countries (LDCs) and developing regions as a whole, progress has been relatively slow. In many cities, even where improved on-site facilities are used to contain excreta, the level of quality and access to services for the emptying, conveyance, treatment, and disposal of the resulting fecal sludge is usually limited. These services are collectively called fecal sludge management (FSM) services. FSM services are the focus of this study, within the broader context of urban sanitation and integrated urban water management (IUWM). This document provides a summary of the diagnostic tools developed for assessing FSM services and is based on field work carried out in the five cities of Balikpapan in Indonesia, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Hawassa in Ethiopia, Lima in Peru, and Santa Cruz in Bolivia. It summarizes the tools themselves, lessons learnt about their use, and general policy recommendations.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-05-11;en;"urbanization;sustainable development;water management;land use;urban areas;property;environment;land";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24722;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24722/1/FSM0Summary0Report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24722/FSM0Summary0Report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24725;Gender-Dimensions of Collective Forest Tenure Reform in China;;"The reform of China's collectively owned forest land, began in 2008, is arguably the largest land-reform undertaking in modern times in terms of area and people affected. Under the reform, forest lands have been contracted to rural households, allowing them more independence in exercising their rights and interests in the forest lands, giving them more opportunities to improve family incomes, and creating incentives for them to cultivate, conserve, and manage forests. These lands are home to some 610 million people, many of them poor. With urbanization, vast numbers of Chinese men have migrated to cities to work, leaving women as the predominant labor force in rural areas. Indeed, some 70 percent of China’s agriculture labor force is now female. The immense scope of this change calls for a systematic examination of how China's rural women gain access to and exploit forest land and associated resources and services. The reform was designed to unfold in two broad stages. In the first, collectively owned forest lands suitable for contracting were allocated on equal terms to each household in affected villages. The ongoing second stage represents a deepening of the reform. It deals with subsidies and ecological compensation, financial services (including use of forest tenure as collateral and transfers of forest land), forest insurance, technical services and training, farmers’ associations and cooperatives, and market services. However, the monitoring had not covered the gender dimension of the reform, meaning that the gender data required to accurately reflect the full effects of the reform have been lacking. Building on the annual monitoring conducted by the FEDRC, the study reported here added gender-related investigation and analysis to obtain gender data about the current reform situation, its problems, and their causes. It also included structured interviews with rural women and group meetings with local government agencies, women’s federations, and village committees.The ultimate objective of the study is to achieve better gender-responsiveness in China’s collective forest tenure reform. Specifically, this includes: (i) equality in access to and control of forest lands, as well as access to associated resources and services; (ii) women’s participation and equality in decision-making concerning the conservation and utilization of forest resources; and (iii) impacts of the first two aspects on the status and well-being of women. The World Bank has had over 30 years of successful cooperation with China in the forestry sector. Women’s access to the services and resources that are the focus of the second stage of the reform will be a critical element of the World Bank’s continuing reform dialogue with its Chinese partners.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-05-31;en;"property rights;capacity building;land rights;farmers;urban areas;property;women";Land & Gender;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;CHN";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24725;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24725/1/Gender0dimensi0nure0reform0in0China.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24725/Gender0dimensi0nure0reform0in0China.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/24734;Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity in Moldova;Progress and Prospects;Moldova has experienced rapid economic growth in the past decade, which has been accompanied by reductions in poverty and good performance in shared prosperity. Nonetheless, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and faces challenges in sustaining the progress. The challenges for progress include spatial and cross-group inequalities, particularly because of unequal access to assets, services and economic opportunities. Moreover, strengthening the persistently weak labor markets to boost employment, especially in the nonfarm sectors, is critical for sustaining progress toward the twin goals of reducing poverty and expanding shared prosperity and for addressing the problems associated with an aging population in a fiscally responsible manner. Accordingly, ensuring the viability of the pension system and improving social assistance are necessary areas of reform, particularly in a context of fiscal pressures, the aging population, and the great vulnerability of the poor to shocks. The Moldova poverty assessment 2016 includes three prongs of analysis: this report, which explores trends and the drivers of poverty and shared prosperity, and the accompanying analyses, ‘a jobs diagnostic for Moldova’ and ‘structural transformation of Moldovan small-holder agriculture and its poverty and shared prosperity impacts.’ The jobs diagnostic explores the main labor demand and supply challenges in Moldova in more detail, while the analysis of structural transformation focuses on the agricultural sector and whether it can become a driver of progress.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-05-31;en;"rural population;land ownership;farmers;farmland;food security;urban areas;rural areas;poverty";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;MDA;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24734;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24734/1/Poverty0reduct0ogress0and0prospects.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24734/Poverty0reduct0ogress0and0prospects.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24736;An Assessment of Uganda's Progressive Approach to Refugee Management;;Refugees in Uganda are either self-settled or live in organized settlements that cover approximately 350 square miles of land set aside by the government of Uganda. Many refugees, especially in the northern districts, are in protracted displacement, and the Ugandan constitution prohibits the naturalization of an offspring of a refugee, even if he or she is born in Uganda and even if one parent is Ugandan. Some refugees have the option of returning to their country of origin, and some can resettle in a third country, often in the West, but doing so is expensive and not viable at a large scale. This study includes a legal and policy analysis and a socioeconomic impact assessment, the former complementing the latter. The impact of legal and policy frameworks on the refugee situation in Uganda are analyzed, as are the social and economic impacts and the contribution of the current policy framework on these outcomes for the refugees. The study employs qualitative and quantitative research methods and covers refugees in rural and urban sites in Uganda. The study’s primary focus is on the socioeconomic impact of Uganda’s refugee law on the refugees themselves. This focus and the tight timeframe did not allow the team to assess the socioeconomic impact of the presence of refugees on host communities.

handle:10986/24740;Achieving Energy Savings by Intelligent Transportation Systems Investments in the Context of Smart Cities;;Faced with the challenge of providing adequate transport services with limited resources, cities have, for several decades, been investing in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS utilize Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to make more efficient use of existing transport infrastructure with the aim of improving transport services and reducing congestion, accidents, and air pollution. In the past two decades, with the rapid advancement of ICT and intensive advocacy from big technology vendors, the concept of ‘smart cities’ has gained great popularity and many cities have started to undertake a more holistic approach to improving urban services using technology in the name of smart city initiatives. Section two introduces these themes, which serve as the analytical framework to understand how smart mobility investments lead to energy savings. The comparison in the search for similarities among the case studies and interviews helped us develop a conceptual model, emphasizing cause and effect and presented in section three, of how ITS deployment and operation in the context of smart cities leads to energy saving benefits. This conceptual model is presented with detailed discussions of institutional, technological, and physical conditions at each step in the model. Section four focuses on energy savings with quantitative evidence of energy saving potential of ITS investments collected from literature and case studies. Section five links the results of this study to the Wuhan Integrated Transport Development Project and how the knowledge has been incorporated into project design. To further explore the energy efficiency potential of Wuhan and to mainstream ITS and smart transport solutions as a source of achieving energy efficiency using results of this study, a TRACE analysis was also completed as part of this research effort. This analysis focused on the passenger transport sector. Finally, policy recommendations on the major conditions under which ITS investments in the context of smart cities achieve energy savings are summarized in Section 6 with specific implications for cities in the developing countries.;"Chen, Yang

handle:10986/24765;Indonesia's Rising Divide;;"In 2015, Indonesia stands as an increasingly divided country, unequal in many ways. There is a growing income divide between the richest 10 percent and the rest of the population, and this gap is driven by many other types of inequality in Indonesia.People are divided into haves and have-nots from before birth. Some children are born healthy and grow up well in their early years; many do not. Some children go to school and receive a quality education; many do not. In today’s modern and dynamic economy; most do not and are trapped in low-productivity and low-wage jobs. Some families have access to formal safety nets that can protect them from the many shocks that occur in life; many do not. And a fortunate few Indonesians have access to financial and physical assets (such as land and property) that increase their wealth over time. This wealth is passed down from generation to generation, both in the form of money and physical assets, and through greater access to better health and education. As a result, inequalities are being compounded and deepened over time. This report asks why inequality is increasing, why it matters, and what can be done. The first section examines the trend in inequality, which is already relatively high in Indonesia and rising more rapidly than in many neighboring countries. The second section seeks to understand what is driving rising inequality in Indonesia. The final section looks at what can be done to prevent the country from becoming even more divided. This section suggests ways to avoid an Indonesia in which relatively few people are healthy, happy and prosperous, and many more can only aspire to a better life but are unable to attain it.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-03-31;en;"corruption;property;women";Land & Gender;;"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24765;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24765/1/Indonesia0s0rising0divide.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24765/Indonesia0s0rising0divide.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/24767;Political Economy of Regional Integration in Sub-Saharan Africa;;Regional integration in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is crucial for its further economic development and, more importantly, its structural transformation away from agriculture towards higher value-added activities, such as manufacturing and services. Yet there are many paths towards greater integration, some of which are easier than others. In order to gain insights into how regional integration is occurring in SSA, determine impediments to it, and develop recommendations for how the World Bank and other development agencies can help further facilitate it, the World Bank commissioned a set of political economy of regional integration studies covering sector analyses of agriculture, financial services, professional services, trade facilitation, and transport. This report summarizes the findings from the sector studies and suggests recommendations for further efforts in these areas by the World Bank and other development agencies. In a comparative context, the findings of the studies suggest cautious optimism for regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Economic integration is more likely to succeed when it occurs alongside regional attempts at improving political stability and or developing joint infrastructure.;"Brenton, Paul

handle:10986/24770;The Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas and of Local Human Development in Romania;;"Romania aims to be a country in which all citizens are provided with an equal opportunity toparticipate in society, where their basic needs are met and their differences respected, and whereall people feel valued and can live in dignity.Our society is still far from this ideal. One in every five Romanian people is income poor. Most of the people living in relative poverty in Romania are in persistent poverty, meening that they have been in poverty for at least the last three years. Despite its relatively low unemployment rate, the country has a very high rate of poverty for in-work people, which is double the EU-27 rate (9 percent). As a response to this situation, the Government of Romania (GoR) has committed itself to lifting 580,000 people out of poverty by 20205 as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy.By 2020, Romania is committed to putting in place a set of policies and programs to (i) lift at least 580,000 people out of relative income poverty by 2020, compared to 2008; (ii) break the inter-generational cycle of poverty; (iii) prevent the recurrence of poverty and social exclusion; and (iv) ensure equal access to social assistance, cash transfers and services to strengthen social cohesion.the GoR asked for the World Bank’s support to develop detailed implementation plans for the 2015-2018 period in the form of nine Flagship Innitiatives that are expected to have the greatest impact in terms of reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. This Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas and Local Human Development in Romania represents the Flagship Initiative develop an instrument to identify poor villages and marginalized rural communities. Specifically the Bank’s technical assistance provided through this project has helped the GoR to develop: (i) a methodology for defining different types of rural marginalized areas based on a set of key criteria and indicators; (ii) detailed maps that present the spatial distribution of the rural marginalized communities by county; (iii) a methodology for defining degrees of local human development from low to comprehensive development, for rural and small urban settlements; and (iv) detailed county-level maps of local human development. In short, the Atlas helps to define which rural areas are marginalized, who lives in these areas (the profile of various disadvantaged groups), and where they are located in Romania.";"Te?liuc, Emil

This paper focuses on smallholder farms, which make up 95 percent of all farms, and explores their potential for growth and the poverty links. Findings reveal that structural change is slow and smallholder farm growth in Moldova is an exception, not the rule. Only a small share of smallholder farms have the interest or capacity to commercialize but need targeted support policies to grow, intensify their farm activities, and integrate into the markets. For the remaining majority, enhancing their livelihoods calls for policies beyond the agricultural sector to help farm households diversify toward non-farm income.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-12-31;en;"land reform;rural population;land rights;land ownership;farmers;land distribution;farmland;food security;transaction costs;rural areas;poverty;rural development";Land & Food Security;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150;MDA;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24779;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24779/1/Structural0tra0nd0shared0prosperity.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24779/Structural0tra0nd0shared0prosperity.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24783;Report on the Simulation of Low Carbon Green Growth Policies, including the Results of Impact Assessment and Final Policy Recommendations;;This assessment presents a synthesis of analysis to contribute to the definition of a lower carbon and greener growth path for Romania to 2050. The objective of Romania’s green growth path is to implement mitigation actions and undertake needed adaptation while preserving growth and employment. Romania has maintained a steady growth in output while containing the growth of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. From now to 2050, real incomes in Romania are expected to continue to grow, and its carbon emissions are expected to continue declining. Romania can meet the targets of the green scenario with only modest costs to growth and employment, European Union (EU) emissions trading for energy-intensive sectors sets a uniform price for GHG allowances, which generates an efficient allocation across countries of mitigation actions in those sectors. The difficulty of meeting the tighter targets for mitigation set out in the green and super green scenarios will be eased significantly by improvements in energy efficiency. Proactive measures to promote smart urban development in Bucharest and other urban areas, including more compact city design, transport-oriented development that changes modal-split, upgrades to a more efficient vehicle stock, and policies promoting building efficiency upgrades, can deliver sizable reductions in annual energy spending and emission levels.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-11-30;en;"land use;climate change";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143;ROU";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24783;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24783/1/Final0Output0Component0C3.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24783/Final0Output0Component0C3.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Economic diversification is a key component of that strategy. The country economic memorandum (CEM) report discusses how the emergence of oil and mineral production can contribute to Uganda’s effort to promote economic diversification as a means to achieve sustainable and shared growth. Based on the lessons from international experience, the report outlines the elements of a development and diversification strategy, which the Ugandan government may wish to consider in the design of its macroeconomic, fiscal, and sectoral development policies. It then focuses on the set of policies required to maximize the benefits of a diversification strategy in an oil-producing country. Finally it describes a series of actions which the government should plan, and carry out to deal with a number of specific implementation issues. The first part of the report focuses on the importance of economic diversification for Uganda and on the prospects and challenges of oil and mineral development. It addresses the following three issues: (a) why diversification is important for economic development?; (b) where Uganda stands in that area and why it should give a new impetus to its diversification strategy?; and (c) what are the prospects, possible impact, and challenges associated to oil and mining development for Uganda’s economy?";;"World Bank Group;Government of Uganda";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-06-30;en;"property rights;sustainable development;forestry;deforestation;property;transaction costs;environment;fisheries;land";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;UGA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24789;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24789/1/Full0report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24789/Full0report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24790;Corporate Governance Success Stories;;This report summarizes the experiences of 19 companies from across the region. Each of the case studies highlights the key corporate governance changes made and the positive impacts that resulted, as reported by the company. The companies represent various countries, sectors, types, and sizes. All of the companies featured are former IFC Advisory Services clients. Some are IFC Investment clients as well. IFC conducted an in-depth corporate governance assessment for each of these companies using IFC’s Corporate Governance Methodology. The assessments resulted in specific recommendations on ways to improve each company’s governance framework and identified implementation plans. The assessments were conducted at various points over the past few years. The time taken to implement changes and realize benefits varied. However, all companies reported that governance changes are continuous and the corresponding benefits manifest themselves in different forms over time. This report provides examples of companies in various stages of change – from recent changes (e.g., Medgulf) to ongoing, longer-term changes (e.g., Bank Audi). This report also includes testimony from three MENA private equity firms (all IFC investment clients). Collectively, these firms have worked with 72 investee companies (past and present funds). Selected based on their association with IFC and their willingness to share their insight and experiences, these firms offer a valuable window into the importance of corporate governance from an investor’s perspective. The material in this report is based on feedback gathered through individual interviews with each organization featured, resulting in well-considered responses. The achievements highlighted are all the more notable given that the interviews and information gathering process took place in in late 2009 (first edition) and 2013 (for current edition), when the region was still under the stress of the crisis.;;International Finance Cooperation;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-06-30;en;"property;land";;;"145;015";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24790;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24790/1/Corporate0governance0success0stories.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24790/Corporate0governance0success0stories.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24793;The Art and Science of Benefit Sharing in the Natural Resource Sector;;The purpose of this paper is to contribute to theunderstanding and discussion of how the costs andbenefits of natural resource development are sharedacross society. This paper presents how IFC, as both aninvestor and a development organization, determineswhether benefits and costs are shared reasonably, and how this assessment influences IFC’s decision to invest ina particular natural resource project. the goal of the paper is to promotea broad, constructive dialogue across stakeholders—governments, investors, civil society, and others—around benefit sharing. The paper draws on IFC’s experience and presents anoverarching framework for multi-stakeholder benefitsharing, providing analysis and guidance for a range ofcomplex topics. The paper is intended to provide entrypoints for stakeholders of varying levels of familiarity with the issues to benefit-sharing assessment. The paper is not a definitive manual for all the issues coveredfor which more detailed, high-quality and excellentreferences and literature exists. This paper is organized along these broad areas of impact that IFC considers in the benefit sharing assessment:fiscal, economic, environmental, and social. The approaches IFC uses to evaluate benefit sharing arepresented in each area, along with some lessons learned. This is complemented by a discussion of key issues thatare topical in the field. Each chapter opens with a list of questions that can be used as a guide to assess the potential benefits and costs of an investment. As a result, there is a spectrum of what can be considered reasonable overall. However, there may be particular features of a benefit-sharing arrangement that stand out and can signal a risk to its legitimacy. Our aspiration is that this paper will complement as well as stimulate work by others that can enhance the collective knowledge and encourage dialogue.;;International Finance Cooperation;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-02-28;en;"capacity building;investment funds;natural disasters;expropriation;landowners;poverty;decentralization;common law";"Land & Investments;Land, Climate change & Environment";Land Policy & Legislation;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24793;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24793/1/The0art0and0sc0r000discussion0paper.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24793/The0art0and0sc0r000discussion0paper.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;International Finance Corporation ;

handle:10986/24800;Enhancing Competition Conditions and Competitiveness of Philippine Domestic Shipping;;For the economy to attain its full potential, the Philippines requires an efficient water transport system. However, this is presently not the case. The domestic shipping industry is characterized by high costs, low quality of service, and a poor safety record. Logistics cost accounts for 24-53 percent of wholesale price, while shipping and port handling cost around 8 percent of wholesale price and 5 percent of retail price. Philippine domestic shipping is generally more expensive than in Malaysia or Indonesia, 2 other archipelagos. Moreover, it is more expensive to transport goods between 2 Philippine ports than between 2 Philippine ports via an international port. In the East Asia region, the Philippines trails behind its neighbors in various logistics performance and connectivity indices. For instance, in liner shipping connectivity, the Philippines ranked 66th out of 157 countries in 2013, and performs the worst among a group of East Asian comparators. Delays in shipment, slow cargo handling, and frequent accidents are the top complaints of businesses. In the East Asia Region, the Philippines has the highest absolute casualty rate and this is 40 percent higher than the second ranked country, Indonesia. On average, there are 228 ships involved in accidents and 303 casualties per year in the Philippines. In seeking to enhance competition in the delivery of domestic shipping services, this assessment has therefore focused particularly on measures that would increase the opportunities and incentives for new players to enter the market, and for existing operators to expand or vary the services they offer.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-09-30;en;;;;"030;009;PHL";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24800;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24800/1/Enhancing0comp0ne0domestic0shipping.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24800/Enhancing0comp0ne0domestic0shipping.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/24808;Growing through Cities in Developing Countries;;This paper examines the effects of urbanization on development and growth. It begins with a labor market perspective and emphasizes the importance of agglomeration economies, both static and dynamic. It then argues that more productive jobs in cities do not exist in a void and underscores the importance of job and firm dynamics. In turn, these dynamics are shaped by the broader characteristics of urban systems. A number of conclusions are drawn. First, agglomeration effects are quantitatively important and pervasive. Second, the productive advantage of large cities is constantly eroded and must be sustained by new job creation and innovation. Third, this process of creative destruction in cities, which is fundamental for aggregate growth, is determined in part by the characteristics of urban systems and broader institutional features. We highlight important differences between developing countries and more advanced economies. A major challenge for developing countries is to reinforce the role of their urban systems as drivers of economic growth.;Duranton, Gilles;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-02-28;en;"urban population;urbanization";Urban Tenure;;;"Reports & Research;Journal Articles & Books";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24808;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24808/1/wbro_30_1_39.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24808/wbro_30_1_39.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24814;Integrated Landscape Approaches for Africa’s Drylands;;"Integrated Landscape Approaches for Africa’s Drylands presents emerging findings on the importance of moving beyond single-sector interventions to embrace integrated landscape management that takes into account the health of the ecosystems that support human livelihoods and contribute to the resilience of rural communities in Sub-Saharan African drylands. Integrated landscape management is particularly important for these drylands because people depend on production systems that are frequently disrupted by exogenous shocks such as drought. The ecological and economic evidence presented in this book shows that integrated landscape management can enhance efforts to invest in tree-based systems and improved livestock management and support productivity increases for rain-fed cropping. Integrated landscape management efforts have helped to coordinate the actions of multiple land users and other stakeholders, reduced confl icts, and improved overall governance of water, land, and other resources. Integrated landscape management is thus a useful approach to enhance the intensification of dryland cropping systems and will, in many locations (but not always), result in multiple wins— including improved farm productivity, water benefi ts at the farm and landscape levels, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and other ecosystem services benefi ts, and higher climate resilience. Various policies and related interventions can be used to trigger and accelerate the scaling up of these benefits through integrated landscape management across Sub-Saharan African drylands to restore and increase household and ecological resilience. Policies are needed to develop the framework conditions necessary to both initiate new programs and modify and scale up existing restoration and resilience efforts. The book highlights policy options, covering six broad intervention areas: (1) Clarify land rights and responsibilities; (2) Encourage multistakeholder involvement and collective action; (3) Overcome institutional barriers to integrated landscape management; (4) Create conditions for adaptive planning and management; (5) Create mechanisms and supporting policies for sustainable and long-term fi nancing of integrated landscape management; and (6) Invest in a solid evidence base and knowledge-sharing platforms for integrated landscape management.";"Gray, Erin

handle:10986/24815;Prospects for Livestock-Based Livelihoods in Africa's Drylands;;Prospects for Livestock-Based Livelihoods in Africa’s Drylands examines the challenges and opportunities facing the livestock sector and the people who depend on livestock in the dryland regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. It presents a novel way of thinking about pastoral development, grounded in a conceptual framework that focuses on the multiple shocks that drylands livestock keepers face and how those shocks can be addressed, drawing on a state-of-the-art literature review carried out by scientists of leading research institutes and development organizations, and integrating the results of an innovative approach to modeling development options for the drylands livestock sector. Looking to the future, the picture is mixed. On the positive side, demand for red meat is expected to strengthen in domestic and regional markets, suggesting that livestock keepers will have good market opportunities. On the negative side, a large majority of livestock keepers are classifi ed as poor, and the natural (feed) resource base is likely to be suffi cient to enable improved meat and milk production for the growing human population. Prospects for the livestock sector through 2030 vary by aridity zone. In arid and semi-arid zones, a reasonable goal for 2030 is to have land use, training, and microfi nance systems established that promote an appropriate balance between human and livestock carrying capacities, featuring mainly grassland/pastoral systems that reliably and sustainably satisfy the minimum income needs of herder households, produce at least a signifi cant part of the demand in local markets for animal source food, and provide environmental services for which livestock keepers receive compensation. The goal includes signifi cant employment generation outside the sector. In the higher rainfall zones of the semi-arid areas, and in the subhumid zones, a reasonable goal for 2030 is to have intensifi ed production systems established, featuring mainly mixed livestock/arable farming or agro-pastoral systems that are closely linked to nearby grassland/pastoral systems and that consistently generate marketable surpluses of differentiated red meat and livestock products that can compete not only in the expanding domestic market but also in selected regional markets.;de Haan, Cees;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-11-02;en;;;;"DZA;BFA;202;NGA;MRT;MLI;ETH;ERI;CMR;002;SSD;CAF;SEN;TCD;NER;SDN";"Reports & Research;Journal Articles & Books";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24815;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24815/2/9781464808364.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24815/9781464808364.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24816;Improved Agricultural Water Management for Africa’s Drylands;;Dryland regions in Sub-Saharan Africa are home to one-half of the region’s population and three-quarters of its poor. Poor both in natural resources and in assets and income, the inhabitants of drylands are highly vulnerable to droughts and other shocks. Despite a long history of interventions by governments, development agencies, and civil society organizations, there have been no sustained large-scale successes toward improving the resilience of drylands dwellers. Improved Agricultural Water Management for Africa’s Drylands describes the extent to which agricultural water management interventions in dryland regions of Sub-Saharan Africa can enhance the resilience and improve the well-being of the people living in those regions, proposes what can realistically be done to promote improved agricultural water management, and sets out how stakeholders can make those improvements. After reviewing the current status of irrigation and agricultural water management in the drylands, the authors discuss technical, economic, and institutional challenges to expanding irrigation. A model developed at the International Food Policy Research Institute is used to project the potential for irrigation development in the Sahel Region and the Horn of Africa. The modeling results show that irrigation development in the drylands can reduce vulnerability and improve the resilience of hundreds of thousands of farming households, but rainfed agriculture will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, many soil and water conservation practices that can improve the productivity and ensure the sustainability of rainfed cropping systems are available. The purpose of this book is to demonstrate the potentially highly benefi cial role of water and water management in drylands agriculture in association with agronomic improvements, market growth, and infrastructure development, and to assess the technological and socioeconomic conditions and institutional policy frameworks that can remove barriers to adoption and allow wide-scale take-up of improved agricultural water management in the dryland regions of Sub-Saharan Africa.;"Ward, Christopher

handle:10986/24818;Improved Crop Productivity for Africa’s Drylands;;More than 200 million people living in dryland regions of Sub-Saharan Africa make their living from agriculture. Most are exposed to weather shocks, especially drought, that can decimate their incomes, destroy their assets, and plunge them into a poverty trap from which it is difficult to emerge. Their lack of resilience in the face of these shocks can be attributed in large part to the poor performance of agriculture on which their livelihood depends. Opportunities exist to improve the fortunes of farming households in the drylands. Improved farming technologies that can increase and stabilize the production of millet, sorghum, maize, and other leading staples are available. Irrigation is technically and economically feasible in some areas and offers additional opportunities to increase and stabilize crop production, especially small-scale irrigation, which tends to be more affordable and easier to manage. Yet many of these opportunities have not been exploited on a large scale, for reasons that include lack of farmer knowledge, nonavailability of inputs, unfavorable price incentives, high levels of production risk, and high cost. Future production growth in drylands agriculture is expected to come mainly from raising yields and increasing the number of crop rotations on land that is already being cultivated (intensification), rather than from bringing new land into cultivation (extensification). Controlling for rainfall, average yields in rainfed cropping systems in Sub-Saharan Africa are still much lower than yields in rainfed cropping systems in other regions, suggesting that there is considerable scope to intensify production in these systems. Furthermore, unlike in other regions, production of low-value cereals under irrigation is generally not economic in Sub-Saharan Africa unless the cereals can be grown in rotation with one or more high-value cash crops. The long-run strategy for drylands agriculture, therefore, must be to promote production of staples in rainfed systems and production of high-value cereals (for example, rice), horticultural cops, and industrial crops in irrigated systems. Based on a detailed review of currently available technologies, Improved Crop Productivity for Africa’s Drylands argues that improving the productivity and stability of agriculture in the drylands has the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that in an environment characterized by limited agro-climatic potential and subject to repeated shocks, farming on small land holdings may not generate sufficient income to bring people out of poverty.;"Walker, Tom

handle:10986/24840;Cheaper, Faster, and More Than Good Enough;Is GPS the New Gold Standard in Land Area Measurement?;In rural societies of low- and middle-income countries, land is a major measure of wealth, a critical input in agricultural production, and a key variable for assessing agricultural performance and productivity. In the absence of cadastral information to refer to, measures of land plots have historically been taken with one of two approaches: traversing (accurate, but cumbersome), and farmers' self-report (cheap, but marred by measurement error). Recently, the advent of cheap handheld GPS devices has held promise for balancing cost and precision. Guided by purposely collected primary data from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania (Zanzibar), and with consideration for practical household survey implementation, the paper assesses the nature and magnitude of measurement error under different measurement methods and proposes a set of recommendations for plot area measurement. The results largely point to the support of GPS measurement, with simultaneous collection of farmer self-reported areas.;"Carletto, Calogero

Using recently developed data on air pollution, tree cover loss, land degradation, slope, rainfall and temperature variability, and flood and drought hazards, the study shows: (i) at the district level, there are hotspots of high poverty and environmental risks; (ii) ethnic minorities and poor households are much more exposed to multiple environmental risks than other groups, and also within rural and urban areas poorer households live in communes exposed to higher environmental risks; and (iii) environmental risks relate to lower consumption levels, but less so to lower consumption growth over time. Altogether these findings suggest that Vietnam’s poor are disproportionally exposed to environmental risks, which can result in livelihood impacts that in many ways go beyond consumption. In light of growing pressures due to population growth, economic development and climate change, green growth actions, ecosystem-based adaptation, and land-use planning could be important strategies to reduce the environmental burden on poor people.";"Narloch, Ulf

handle:10986/24876;Africa;Whatever You Thought, Think Again;Paul Wolfowitz, President of the World Bank, congratulated the editorial team of National Geographic for the special issue on Africa. National Geographic has played a unique role in broadening the knowledge of the world. The World Bank partnered with National Geographic to produce a full-color wall map to raise awareness of the millennium development goals (MDGs) and to highlight each country's progress. We often hear about an Africa that is ravaged by poverty, disease and conflict. There is another face to Africa, one of hope, ambition, energy, intelligence and achievement. That face is also captured compellingly in this issue. Africa’s future holds rich opportunities. To seize these opportunities, there are many challenges to overcome. Given the enormous scale of this challenge, we need to come to terms with what we can and cannot achieve with the MDGs. The World Bank is working with countries that request help to strengthen legislation and institutions so they can take charge of combating corruption. Africa's transformation will depend on the commitment of the international community and the resolve of Africa's people and leaders. Michael Fay, National Geographic Explorer in Residence, spoke of his travels in Africa and said that there is a very direct relationship in particular in the African continent, but indeed everywhere on earth, between the management of the natural resource base and poverty alleviation, the wellbeing of humanity. Frannie Leautier, of the World Bank Institute, said countries working together can reach solutions that are much better than when they work individually. She noted the need to balance between human life and other life forms, with the forests, animals and so on. Paulo Gomes, of the World Bank Board of Directors, said the issue was very rich in presenting the ecological dimension of the diversity of Africa. The Bank needs to do something in preparing a comprehensive strategy to rebrand Africa in a more positive light. Africa has a formidable reservoir of variety in fauna and flora that can be used for science and the good of the continent. The panel fielded questions on urban ecology, indigenous knowledge, resource management, and governance amid ethnic diversity.;"Wolfowitz, Paul

handle:10986/24886;Trade;The Missing Link to Opportunity;Paul Wolfowitz, President of the World Bank, argued that the Doha Round presents an opportunity to rewrite the rules of an unfair trading system that holds back the potential of the poorest people. As important as aid is, as important as debt relief is, the opportunities generated by trade are far more significant. Unless the people of Africa and other poor countries have access to markets to sell their products, they will not escape poverty or be able to give their children a better future. He said, under the current rules, rich countries are allowed to keep barriers highest on the goods produced by poor countries. Wolfowitz emphasized that rich countries pay out a total of 280 billion dollars in subsidies to their farmers each year. But the real damage is done to farmers in poor countries who are denied markets to sell their goods. It is their children who go hungry, who are deprived of clean water, medicines, and the most basic necessities of life.;Wolfowitz, Paul;;;World Bank Group;2005-12-07;en;"corruption;farmers;poverty;women";Land & Gender;;;Conference Papers & Reports;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24886;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24886/1/Remarks0on0tra0tz00Paul00President.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24886/Remarks0on0tra0tz00Paul00President.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Brazil is working to turn this double challenge into a double dividend, by meeting energy needs that are essential for growth and fighting poverty, while leaving a smaller environmental footprint. Investing in the environment is investing in the future of the poor. To improve the lives of the poor and to create job opportunities for them, the developing countries need much more energy than they use today. The second and much greater challenge lies in slowing the threat of deforestation. The World Bank Group’s mission is to support economic development and policies that helps the poor.

But equally important is the agenda to reduce poverty. We face this double challenge of reducing damaging carbon emissions, and still meeting the energy demands of the world’s poor. The role of the World Bank Group is to provide technical support to pilot innovative ideas, to work with countries to develop alternative strategies, and to listen and partner with the private sector which is going to provide much of the engine in innovation and financing. Carbon trading could generate resource flows in the order of $200 billion a year. The Bank is helping developing countries to move to a lower carbon path by exploiting renewable energy resources, supporting energy conservation, and increasing efficiency. Second, the Bank is playing a role is in promoting new technology. The third focus of the Bank is to prevent deforestation.

Rich countries also need to lead with direct support to developing nations, both to reduce poverty and reduce carbon emissions.

handle:10986/24919;Seaweed Aquaculture for Food Security, Income Generation and Environmental Health in Tropical Developing Countries;;To meet carbon emissions targets, more than 30 countries have committed to boosting production of renewable resources from biological materials andconvert them into products such as food, animal feedand bioenergy. In a post-fossil-fuel world, an increasingproportion of chemicals, plastics, textiles, fuels and electricity will have to come from biomass, which takesup land. To maintain current consumption trends theworld will also need to produce 50–70 percent more foodby 2050, increasingly under drought conditions and onpoor soils. Depending on bioenergy policies, biomassuse is expected to continue to rise to 2030 and importsto Europe are expected to triple by 2020. Europe isforecast to import 80 million tons of solid biomass peryear by 2020. The expansion of seaweed farming in tropical developingcountries could have large positive impacts on localpoverty, ecosystem management and climate changemitigation. Being able to produce enough biomass and protein for the growing and increasingly wealthyhuman population with no new land and freshwater expropriation for agriculture would dramatically reducehumanity’s ecological footprint relative to currenttrends and projections. The growth of seaweed farming is constrained primarily by lack of proper marine spatial plans and appropriate financing. The current industry in the tropics isbased on inshore areas where multiple conflict ingusers vie for space.The need for technological improvements has consequentimplications for scale of investment, which couldbe a hindrance to many potential seaweed growers,creating space for government engagement to supportnew smaller and medium-scale entrepreneurs.Other opportunities for engagement by governmentsand international agencies committed to sustainable development include investments in transport infrastructure,storage facilities, food preparation and/or hydrocolloid extraction plants, applied researchin solar drying and biogas technology inter alia,technical training and marine spatial planning.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-07-01;en;"aquaculture;food security;climate change";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"TZA;JPN;MYS;MDG;CHN;NAM;IDN;AUS;013;021;PRK;ARG;009;KOR;LKA;BRA;NZL";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24919;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24919/1/Seaweed0aquacu0Developing0Countries.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24919/Seaweed0aquacu0Developing0Countries.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24940;Thailand Economic Monitor, June 2016;Aging Society and Economy;The Thai economy shows signs of a nascent recovery but faces challenges on the path toward a broad-based and sustained recovery. The Thai economy accelerated to 2.8 percent in 2015, compared to 0.9 percent in 2014, partly on the basis of government consumption and investment, and partly on declining imports. Tourism and private consumption have mildly recovered, whereas merchandise exports dropped in the last quarter of 2015. Economic growth is expected to moderate to 2.5 percent in 2016 primarily due to sluggish exports of goods and private investment amid a slowing and difficult global environment. Fiscal stimulus and tourism receipts will remain key drivers of growth in 2016. Poverty rates are expected to fall at a slower rate, with poor households concentrated in rural areas affected by falling agricultural prices. Downside risks to economic growth include a hard landing in China accompanied by global financial turmoil as well as heightened domestic political uncertainty.

handle:10986/24941;Identification in the Context of Forced Displacement;Identification for Development;Lack of identity documents is an important obstacle to the protection of people forced to leave their homes by conflict, persecution, or natural disaster. At the most basic level, a person lacking identity documents cannot travel through the legal channels. Lack of identification can make people more vulnerable to trafficking, for example by making it more difficult to prove a person’s age or family relationships. Those who lack identity documents may face greater difficulties proving their entitlement to nationality or to refugee status. The absence of fair and effective processes for registration and identification places displaced persons at the risk of exploitation and exclusion. Access to essential public services will be limited. Children are at risk of becoming stateless because of difficulties in accessing birth registration and because the rules and practices in place may prevent them from acquiring the nationality either of (one of) their parents or of the country of birth. Poorly implemented identification systems may even put displaced people at greater risk. If registration and identification procedures are not properly carried out, people who qualify to be recognized as refugees or stateless. Persons, or as nationals, may be subject to immigration detention and deportation to a country where they are in danger, or to illegal exploitation where they are. Weak identification systems can make it difficult for displaced persons and their children to reunite, to repatriate after crises have ended, and to reclaim land and property that they left behind. Robust identification and registration systems for displaced people also mitigate the disruptive impacts of rapid influxes of refugees for governments, and assist planning to respond to the needs of the displaced populations.;Manby, Bronwen;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-06-01;en;;;;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24941;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24941/4/Identification0r0development00ID4D0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24941/Identification0r0development00ID4D0.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24947;Climate-Smart Agriculture Indicators;;There is by now substantial consensus within the development community over the need for a more climate smart agriculture, which consists of three defining principles: enhancing agriculture’s resilience to climate change, reducing agricultural green-house gas emissions, and sustainably increasing production. With 795 million people still not getting their minimum dietary requirements, there is little scope for trade-offs between increasing production and improving agriculture’s environmental impacts. Making climate smart agriculture operational will rely on our ability to measure production, resilience, and emissions in a way that informs decision makers about the policies, technologies, and practices that most effectively promotes each. In addition to the direct results of an improved activity or practice, longer term outcomes can lead to fundamental changes in the way that producers, consumers, investors, and others behave—and what they base their production, consumption, and investment decisions on. The indicators described in this document were developed for this purpose. Applying the indicators to examine the agricultural performance of different countries reveals a number of correlates relating to institutions, legal frameworks, and the relationships between agriculture and other sectors like water and energy. Applying them to projects affirms the important advantages of approaches that employ appropriate technologies and that incorporate broader, landscape-based perspectives that recognize and allow for competing demands for land and water resources. The type of highly practical empirical evidence that will be amassed by monitoring these indicators is going to be pivotal in mitigating agriculture’s large ecological foot-print, in capitalizing on its potential to provide environmental services, and in guiding the forms of intensification that lead to substantially higher and more sustainable production.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-06-01;en;climate change;Land, Climate change & Environment;;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24947;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24947/1/Climate0smart0agriculture0indicators.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24947/Climate0smart0agriculture0indicators.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24964;Making Rural Broadband Affordable;Synchronizing Installation with Other Public Works;The high cost of extending Internet service beyond urban areas and the relatively low number of potential subscribers has combined to stall the expansion of this enabling technology in much of the developing world (and even in some advanced economies). Installing cables over land by exploiting existing infrastructure to carry the line eliminates most of the construction costs of domestic Internet networks—but that colocation option is much less available for remote or thinly populated areas. A way forward is to synchronize the installation with work on other suitable infrastructure projects (transport, energy, water, gas). The developmental value of high-speed Internet and the strategy of colocating cable with transport and power corridors are well understood. The missing piece is a legal and regulatory push to ensure that cable is accommodated when private or public infrastructure is built or renovated in rural areas.

Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe and has a population of 43 million, the majority of whom live in urban areas. It is a lower middle income country, with the services, industry and agriculture sectors being main contributors to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Ukraine faces a number of environmental challenges, as identified in its National Environmental Strategy 2020 (NES). Key among these are: air pollution; quality of water resources and land degradation; solid waste management; biodiversity loss; human health issues associated with environmental risk factors; in addition to climate change. The scope of Ukrainian environmental legislation is quite broad and comprehensive (more than 300 legal acts) and covers most areas of environmental protection and natural resources management. However, the environmental legislation faces a number of weaknesses:The environmental legislation is largely declaratory in nature and does not have all the essential enforcement mechanisms for the implementation of legal acts and international agreements; Many of the acts are not coordinated with each other; and Legislation undergoes limited analysis of its impact—for example, no in-depth analysis such as Regulatory Impact Analysis is conducted for proposed pieces of legislation.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-01-31;en;"sustainable development;land degradation;forestry;land use;climate change;deforestation;property;environment;fisheries;land";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143;UKR";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24971;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24971/4/Ukraine000Coun0ironmental0analysis.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24971/Ukraine000Coun0ironmental0analysis.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/24981;A Country on the Move;Domestic Migration in Two Regions of Myanmar;In the last four years Myanmar’s economy has seen a slight shift away from agriculture toward industry and services. This may mark the beginning of a structural transformation away from a rural, agricultural economy toward a more urban, industrial and service-based economy. Urbanization and job creation in urban areas have the potential to have a significant impact on labor and mobility patterns, especially for the landless and land-poor workers that account for a large part of the rural workforce. Domestic migration has been a critical component of the way many other countries in the region, including South Korea, China, and Vietnam, have managed to reduce poverty and support resilient livelihoods. However, pursuing these opportunities often entails significant risk for poor migrant households, who often have little capacity to absorb the shocks of failed migration attempts. Developing access to a knowledge base that enables them to manage risk more easily and make more informed choices around migration is critical to supporting their livelihoods. Migration flows can also have long-term social and economic consequences in rural areas as members of the labor force, particularly young people, move into cities and towns. This entails major public policy choices around areas such as spatial development, urbanization, service delivery, and poverty reduction. The government will need information on anticipated migrant flows in order to make the right policy choices and to plan for and provide services to people arriving from rural areas into urban settings. Within this evolving context, understanding the motivations, patterns, and dynamics of existing migration practices is critical in order to assist balanced and inclusive development in Myanmar by supporting safe and informed migration. The primary objective of this study is to collect detailed evidence and provide an objective assessment of how, and to what extent, migration within and from particular regions of Myanmar affects the livelihoods of rural households and the social and economic environment of villages. It seeks to understand how migration decisions take place, the key obstacles and risks faced by migrants, and the individual and household strategies that evolve to manage them. It also seeks to capture broader changes over time in sending communities, and how the departure and return of migrants affects social and economic dynamics at home and within the village. The study focuses on the Ayeyarwady Region and the Magway Region of Myanmar, which are home to large numbers of Myanmar’s rural poor and are also close to two of the major centers of growth and job creation in the country, Yangon and Mandalay respectively. In these areas, the study applies a mixed-methods approach to the four key questions outlined.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-12-31;en;;;;"030;009;MMR";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24981;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/24981/4/A0country0on0t0o0regions0of0Myanmar.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24981/A0country0on0t0o0regions0of0Myanmar.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/25003;Creating Pro-Poor Transport;Connecting the Dots - Transport, Growth, and Poverty Reduction;"Transport plays a crucial role in connecting people to goods and services and fostering sustainable development. The literature links improved transport infrastructure to economic growth and poverty reduction through five key mechanisms: (1) reducing transport and production costs, (2) creating jobs, (3) expanding productive capacity, (4) improving access to markets and basic services like health and education, and (5) reducing prices of final goods and services. These benefits depend on supportive conditions in other sectors, such as access to credit, functioning land markets, low trade barriers, and so on. Therefore, any assessment of potential gains from transport infrastructure and services should also account for the interaction with complementary markets. However, the analysis of such interactions, assessing how and when transport infrastructure can help reduce poverty and income inequality, is largely missing from the literature, leaving significant knowledge gaps across the spectrum of transportation settings. This note highlights existing findings and some limitations in the literature on three basic types of transport infrastructure: large projects such as regional or national highways and railroads; rural transport; and transport in urban areas.";Alam, Muneeza Mehmood;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-10-31;en;"poverty;farmers";;;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25003;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25003/1/Creating0pro0p0nd0poverty0reduction.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25003/Creating0pro0p0nd0poverty0reduction.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/25008;Transport at COP21;Part of the Climate Change Solution;The case for climate action has never been stronger. Around the world, climate change is putting at risk the lives of millions of people as well as threatening many coastal cities and endangering trillion of dollars of investments in transport infrastructure and services. The Twenty-First Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring heads of state and ministers to Paris at the end of November to reach a global climate agreement with far-reaching implications for low-carbon and climate-resilient growth. Transport is playing a greater role in COP21 than in past UNFCCC conferences as a critical part of the solution: a sector that can contribute to both reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and building economy wide resilience to the impacts of climate change. In view of the sector’s potential, the heavily debated transport question is how to sustainably meet the rising global demand for greater interconnectedness and mobility. The World Bank and the seven other leading multilateral development banks have joined forces with the Paris Process for Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and the rest of the transport community to call for more action on transport and climate change.;"Ebinger, Jane

handle:10986/25047;Prevalence, Economic Contribution, and Determinants of Trees on Farms across Sub-Saharan Africa;;Trees on farms are often overlooked in agricultural and natural resource research and policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper addresses this gap using data from the Living Standards Measurement Study–Integrated Surveys on Agriculture in five countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. Trees on farms are widespread. On average, one third of rural smallholders grow trees. They account for an average of 17 percent of total annual gross income for tree-growing households and 6 percent for all rural households. Gender, land and labor endowments, and especially forest proximity and national context are key determinants of on-farm tree adoption and management. These new, national-scale insights on the prevalence, economic contribution and determinants of trees on farms in Africa lay the basis for exploring the interaction of agriculture, on-farm tree cultivation, and forestry. This will improve our understanding of rural livelihood dynamics.;"Miller, Daniel C.

The analysis consists of a rigorous evidence-based review of the strengths and weaknesses of Kyiv’s public transport system and a proposed plan improve its network and operational efficiency. It directly addresses the City Administration’s aim to develop practically-focused proposals for optimizing Kyiv’s public transport networks so as to improve their operational and environmental efficiency, minimize costs for operators, and maximize connectivity. These proposals also take into account the future land use plan for the city. The analytical work, requested by KSCA, aimed to support Kyiv City Administration (KCA) in improving the mobility conditions in Kyiv though practically-focused recommendations on public transport service optimization and reorganization. The proposed optimization plans and reforms aim to tackling the operational and capacity deficiencies that are routinely experienced on the local public transport networks during peak hours. The analytical work benefited from a solid partnership with KCA and other stakeholders and aim to reflect a common view on the proposed measures and their implementation. This report summarizes the analyses, findings and recommendations that emerged from the assessment and optimization plans. The remaining of this report is organized as follows: Chapter 2 presents the assessment of the current mobility conditions in Kyiv. It presents the results of an evidence based and data driven assessment of the demand and supply for public transport and the results of a benchmarking analysis comparing key variables among cities with comparable characteristics. Chapter 3 presents the optimization plans. It includes the principles applied during the optimization process and the resulting scenarios as well as their estimated impacts on users’ mobility, suppliers’ operations and the environment.Chapter 4 discusses key aspects of a sustainable transport roadmap. The chapter discusses issues related to the implementation of the optimization plans as well as broader aspects related to the overall improvement of the mobility conditions such as priority investments, traffic management and control, parking and integrated planning.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-06-27;en;;;;"150;143;UKR";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25092;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25092/1/Sustainable0ur0stem0and0innovations.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25092/Sustainable0ur0stem0and0innovations.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/25098;The Big Switch in Latin America;Restoring Growth through Trade;This report, produced by the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) of the World Bank, examines LAC’s challenges as the global economy settles to an equilibrium with lower growth and lower commodity prices. Chapter 1 gives an overview of the world economy and how it affects LAC’s short and medium-term prospects. It argues that LAC suffered an external shock that shaped growth in recent years, and that the current global context is likely here to stay. Many LAC countries experienced significant depreciations which in principle should help adjust to the new equilibrium. The extent to which these depreciations facilitate a soft landing, however, depends on a number of factors. Chapter 2 explores the response of LAC’s trade to the recent depreciations and the role it could play in facilitating a recovery. It examines if there are early signs of an export recovery and whether the region’s increased dependence on commodity exports could hinder LAC’s recovery.;"de la Torre, Augusto

Concepts such as anti-poverty targeting, market access or rural electrification seem far more relevant – and easier to grasp. And yet some of today’s most groundbreaking initiatives in these areas rely on big data. This publication profiles these and more, showing how data on an unprecedented scale has the potential to improve lives in unprecedented ways. The featured case stories illustrate the diverse range of big data applications in development. For the World Bank, with twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, big data is big news – and this is just the beginning. The Big Data program brings togetherdata scientists, social scientists and sector specialists in a work program with two main objectives: To accelerate organizational capabilities in big data analytics for use in research and operations – to help the World Bank Group (WBG) better work towards ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. To position WBG as a leader in the use of big data solutions in development. The program aims to scale early pilots into projects that solve significant development challenges, and to establish best practices for using big data analytics to steer evidence-driven development. Launched in September 2014, the Big Data Innovation Challenge has been key in encouraging big data approaches. Exceeding all expectations, it attracted 131 innovative proposals and awarded 14 with funding and expertise to enable big data analytics in their projects. The winning initiatives cover an exciting range, from using satellite imagery to improve poverty mapping, to mining social media data to understand political sentiment, or cellphone data to increase the use of banking services. Others promote traffic flows or accountable road building, anticipate crop yields, predict violent crime and promote registration of land rights. This publication profiles 16 extraordinary initiatives from the Challenge winning teams and finalists.

handle:10986/25123;Minimizing Ecological Damage from Road Improvement in Tropical Forests;;A spatial econometric model is used to link road upgrading to forest clearing and biodiversity loss in the moist tropical forests of Bolivia, Cameroon, and Myanmar. Using 250-meter cells, the model estimates the relationship between the rate of forest clearing in a cell and its distance to the urban market, with explicit attention given to road quality and simultaneity, terrain elevation and slope, the agricultural opportunity value of the land, and its legal protection status. Forest clearing is found to be most responsive to the distance to the nearest urban market, especially with secondary roads with lower typical speeds. Using the estimated forest-clearing response elasticities and a composite biodiversity indicator, an index of expected biodiversity loss from upgrading secondary roads to primary status is computed in each cell. The results identify areas in the three countries where high expected biodiversity losses may warrant additional protection as road upgrading continues. In addition, the results provide ecological risk ratings for individual road corridors that can inform environmentally sensitive infrastructure investment programs.;"Dasgupta, Susmita

handle:10986/25140;Attracting Investment in Bangladesh—Sectoral Analyses;A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study;"This is volume 3 of a three-volume publication on Bangladesh’s trade prospects. Bangladesh’s ambition is to build on its very solid growth and poverty reduction achievements, and accelerate growth to become a middle income country by 2021, and share prosperity more widely amongst its citizens. This includes one of its greatest development challenges: to provide gainful employment to the over 2 million people that will join the labor force each year over the next decade. Moreover, only 54.1 million of its 94 million working age people are employed. Bangladesh needs to use its labor endowment even more intensively to increase growth and, in turn, to absorb the incoming labor. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study identifies the following actions centered around four pillars to sustain and accelerate export growth: (1) breaking into new markets through a) better trade logistics to reduce delivery lags ; as world markets become more competitive and newer products demand shorter lead times, to generate new sources of competitiveness and thereby enable market diversification; and b) better exploitation of regional trading opportunities in nearby growing and dynamic markets, especially East and South Asia; (2) breaking into new products through a) more neutral and rational trade policy and taxation and bonded warehouse schemes; b) concerted efforts to spur domestic investment and attract foreign direct investment, to contribute to export promotion and diversification, including by easing the energy and land constraints; and c) strategic development and promotion of services trade; (3) improving worker and consumer welfare by a) improving skills and literacy; b) implementing labor and work safety guidelines; and c) making safety nets more effective in dealing with trade shocks; and (4) building a supportive environment, including a) sustaining sound macroeconomic fundamentals; and b) strengthening the institutional capacity for strategic policy making aimed at the objective of international competitiveness to help bring focus and coherence to the government’s reform efforts. This third volume provides in-depth analysis of eight different manufacturing and services sectors of the Bangladeshi economy, which help to illustrate the thematic analysis of volume 2 and ground it in sector experiences. Besides pointing to cross-cutting themes, the analysis also highlights some specific issues and actions that could help relieve constraints to faster export growth in these sectors.";"Kathuria, Sanjay

handle:10986/25171;Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Opportunities in Agricultural Landscapes;A Practitioner’s Guide to Agricultural and Land Resources Management;Agriculture, and the patterns of land-use change that are associated with it, have a significant ecological footprint, including the effects it has on climate change, accounting for about one-quarter of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Yet agriculture is also the only economic sector in which opportunities are present to mitigate climate change, mainly by removing substantial volumes of carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering them in soils and plant tissues. This report synthesizes information on the many areas in which agricultural GHG emissions can be reduced. Its focus is on mitigation, though many if not most of the measures described address adaptation and resilience as well. The three pillars of CSA serve two purposes in this respect, which is highly appropriate because we can never take our eyes off the imperative of increasing productivity and employing agriculture as an instrument for economic development. The report highlights the pattern of emissions in agricultural landscapes and the primary sources of these emissions. Thereafter, it reviews mitigation opportunities in croplands, pastures, livestock, soil management, biofuels, and elsewhere, followed by case studies that illustrate practical examples. These practical lessons are useful in contributing to the knowledge base of good practices. The report then turns to the factors that constrain or enable the uptake of climate-smart solutions, such as those depicted in the case studies, and discusses ways to overcome the constraints and elements of enabling environments in which mitigation alternatives become widely embraced. The final exercise feeding into the report is a review of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—an outline of country- level strategies to address climate change. This also presents recommendations for prioritizing World Bank (Bank) mitigation engagement in each region. Approaches to filling mitigation financing and knowledge gaps in country programs, boost the Bank’s mitigation investment portfolio, and create a cohesive strategy for implementing mitigation technologies and practices are discussed.;"Braimoh, Ademola K.

handle:10986/25177;Do They Do As They Say?;Stated versus Revealed Preferences and Take Up in an Incentives for Conservation Program;Use of conditional cash transfers has become widespread in development policy given their success in boosting health and education outcomes. Recently, conditional cash transfers are being used to promote pro-environmental behavior. While many of these Payments for Environment Services (PES) programs have been successful, it has been hypothesized that those with less favorable outcomes have been subject to low additionality, whereby landholders already conserving their land self-select into the program. Insights from the behavioral economics literature suggest that an external incentive, such as PES, has the potential to crowd in or crowd out individual behavior differentially across the initial distribution of intrinsic motivations (Frey, 1992). Thus, to increase the impact of PES, program administrators might gain from a better understanding of both the pre-existing motivations and existing baseline conservation behavior of potential participants. This paper contributes to the literature by disentangling and measuring intrinsic motivations, specifically: Pro-Environment, Pro-Social, Pro-Government, and Social Norms. Controlling for observable opportunity costs, we use these latent motivations to analyze behavioral determinants of take up for a conservation program in São Paulo, Brazil. The payments are an incentive to comply with the Brazil Forest Code. We find that Pro-Social and Pro-Environment landholders are both more likely to be conserving private land not under legal protection before the program is introduced, whereas only Pro-Social landholders are already conserving land under legal protection. With respect to enrollment in the PES program, we find Pro-Social landholders are less likely to enroll while Pro-Environment landholders are more likely to enroll. Thus we expect some level of additionality from the PES program. We discuss these findings in light of the theoretical framework on Self-Determination Theory (SDT).;"De Martino, Samantha

handle:10986/25178;Exploratory Assessment of Factors that Influence Quality of Local Irrigation Water Governance in Uzbekistan;;"Agriculture in Uzbekistan is almost entirely dependent on irrigation. However, despite reforms to institutional arrangements, much of Uzbekistan’s irrigation is reportedly caught in a vicious cycle of inadequate operation and maintenance, low cost recovery, and agricultural productivity that is often moderate or low; in addition, many farmers earn low incomes (World Bank, 2013).Few incentives exist to save water because farmers do not see the direct cost of water provision.This study was undertaken with the aim of contributing to better irrigation water management in Central Asia, beginning in Uzbekistan. It identifies factors and conditions that positively affect the performance of local irrigation water management institutions. The analytical framework for this assessment is formed by the eight design principles for the management of common-pool resources developed by Ostrom (1990). These design principles are in essence factors that are associated with successful collective action in governing common-pool resources such as irrigation water, forests, and fishing areas. By determining why these principles are met in some cases and not in others, and what factors are behind this variation, the author can identify measures that promote these factors/conditions in irrigation schemes. This study was undertaken with the aim of contributing to better irrigation water management in Central Asia, beginning in Uzbekistan. It identifies factors and conditions that positively affect the performance of local irrigation water–management institutions. The study also prepared an associated diagnostic tool that will help design measures and program interventions to strengthen these institutions in ongoing or future irrigation operations. Lastly, the work intends to contribute to an exchange of good practices and knowledge sharing among relevant stakeholders across the Central Asia region.";"Swinkels, Rob

handle:10986/25188;Investing in Africa’s Agriculture;Solidifying Foundation for Sustainable and Inclusive Development;Agriculture has been essentially the backbone of economic growth for centuries. The sector has provided employment for the majority of the world population for generations, and has served as a powerful force in transforming of economies towards an industry- and service- based. In many countries, through both productivity increases and farm land expansion, agriculture contributed to the transformation by releasing labor force for the other parts of the economy, providing food security, keeping wage down by providing low cost food, and generating foreign exchange. All these contributions are essential for broader social and economic development (Bruce and Mellor, 1961). In the 21st century, agriculture remains a fundamental instrument for sustainable development and poverty reduction. WDR 2008, Agriculture for Development, convincingly demonstrates the need to increase investment in agriculture and improve the effectiveness of such investment in order to enhance the sector’s role in overall growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. As an economic activity, agriculture can be a source of growth for the national economy and a provider of investment opportunities for the private sector. Robust empirical evidence from many countries consistently shows that agriculture is several times more efficient in reducing poverty than other sectors, given majority of the world’s poor living in rural area and relying on the sector as a major income source (World Bank, 2008). Agriculture can also be a major provider of environmental services, through sequestering carbon, managing watersheds, and preserving biodiversity. Therefore, agriculture offers great promise in today’s world for growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability. China’s successful development in the past three decades exemplifies the powerful role the agricultural sector can play in a country’s social and economic transformation.;"Li, Guo

It reviews sector performance from the perspective of three main stakeholder groups – government, investors in the mining value chain and civil society – and identifies gaps between declared and actual government policy and practice. The reviews findings are: Performance across the minerals value chain is better in the latter stages related to investment, accumulation, and expenditure of mineral revenue. The mining policy and legal framework are largely sound. The environmental protection legislation is quite current and mostly based on ‘good practice’ except for access to Environmental Impact Assessments. Land use issues, including resettlement and compensation, require a more inclusive process and stronger legislated framework. A local content policy for the mining industry should be developed with mining sector participation to ensure that both the needs of government and industry are met. Institutions are for the most part staffed with trained, qualified people although sometimes there are not sufficient numbers of staff with the required experience. The top shared priority by all three stakeholder groups is Sector Management and Intragovernmental Coordination. MInGov’s methodology focuses on the status of governance and investment conditions in the mining sector from the perspective of stakeholders, and as reportedin primary and secondary sources.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-08-31;en;;;;"002;BWA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25225;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25225/8/109316.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25225/109316.pdf.jpg?sequence=7&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/25328;Indigenous Peoples;;The Inspection Panel was created in 1993 by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank to receive complaints submitted by people suffering harm allegedly caused by World Bank projects. This experience provides important lessons for both the Bank and for the global development community at large. The Panel therefore launched this series of publications to draw the main emerging lessons from its caseload. While Panel cases tend to highlight challenging projects where things went wrong and are not necessarily reflective of the Bank’s entire portfolio, the lessons nonetheless are important. This exercise is intended to help build the institutional knowledge base, enhance accountability, foster better results in project outcomes, and, ultimately, contribute to more effective development with shared prosperity for all. The series is organized around the most recurrent issues in Panel investigations. This report, the second in the series, covers Panel cases that focused on Indigenous Peoples’ issues. Currently, there are approximately 370 million self-identified Indigenous Peoples in some 90 countries worldwide. They are among the world’s most vulnerable, marginalized, and disadvantaged groups. According to the World Bank, while Indigenous Peoples own, occupy, or use a quarter of the world’s surface area, they safeguard 80 percent of its remaining biodiversity, and some of the most biologically important lands and waters are intact as a result of Indigenous Peoples’ stewardship. Their knowledge and expertise on how to adapt, mitigate, and reduce risks from climate change and natural disasters are considered vital. Adequately responding to these challenges requires considering Indigenous Peoples as fundamental stakeholders and important partners in the development process. The Bank has undertaken several reviews and evaluations of its Indigenous Peoples Policy since 1982.The Inspection Panel’s mandate covers projects financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). The Compliance Advisor Ombudsman handles complaints related to projects financed by the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.

We use household data from 6 countries to show that there is great potential for such markets to increase productivity and equalize factor ratios. While rental markets transfer land to land-poor and labor-rich producers, their operation and thus impact may be constrained by policy restrictions. Their functioning may also be constrained by ill-defined or insecure rights that may arise from failure to fully compensate existing rights in cases of expropriation, a failure to implement more broadly land policies or to do so in a gender sensitive manner. Methodological and substantive conclusions are derived.;"Deininger, Klaus

handle:10986/25372;Evaluating Multi-Sensor Nighttime Earth Observation Data for Identification of Mixed vs. Residential Use in Urban Areas;;This paper introduces a novel top-down approach to geospatially identify and distinguish areas of mixed use from predominantly residential areas within urban agglomerations. Under the framework of the World Bank’s Central American Country Disaster Risk Profiles (CDRP) initiative, a disaggregated property stock exposure model has been developed as one of the key elements for disaster risk and loss estimation. Global spatial datasets are therefore used consistently to ensure wide-scale applicability and transferability. Residential and mixed use areas need to be identified in order to spatially link accordingly compiled property stock information. In the presented study, multi-sensor nighttime Earth Observation data and derivative products are evaluated as proxies to identify areas of peak human activity. Intense artificial night lighting in that context is associated with a high likelihood of commercial and/or industrial presence. Areas of low light intensity, in turn, can be considered more likely residential. Iterative intensity thresholding is tested for Cuenca City, Ecuador, in order to best match a given reference situation based on cadastral land use data. The results and findings are considered highly relevant for the CDRP initiative, but more generally underline the relevance of remote sensing data for top-down modeling approaches at a wide spatial scale.;"Aubrecht, Christoph

Using individual, plot-level labor input data from nationally representative household surveys across six Sub-Saharan African countries, this study estimates the average female labor share in crop production at 40%. It is slightly above 50% in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, and substantially lower in Nigeria (37%), Ethiopia (29%), and Niger (24%). There are no systematic differences across crops and activities, but female labor shares tend to be higher in households where women own a larger share of the land and when they are more educated. Controlling for the gender and knowledge profile of the respondents does not meaningfully change the predicted female labor shares. The findings question prevailing assertions regarding substantial gains in aggregate crop output as a result of increasing female agricultural productivity.;"Palacios-Lopez, Amparo

handle:10986/25375;Ten Messages About Youth Employment in South East Europe;;"Today, nearly half of youth in the six South East European countries (SEE6) are not in the labor market, and one quarter is inactive—not in employment, education, or training. These poor outcomes partly reflect a difficult recovery in SEE6 from the 2008 global financial crisis, which sent already high youth unemployment soaring to new heights. This paper presents 10 evidence-based messages on the youth employment challenges in SEE6. The 10 messages demonstrate that many factors disproportionately affect jobless youth. Often young people bear the brunt of the structural and cyclical vulnerabilities that are embedded in the functioning of labor markets in the region. But the challenges faced by cyclically unemployed and structurally jobless young people in SEE6 differ, and so do the policy responses to address them. For the former, it is vital to keep youth engaged in the labor market during recessions and build their human capital while the labor market recovers. For the latter, the policy agenda is deeper; it is necessary to address the disincentives to work and hire youth embedded in exclusionary labor regulations and labor taxation; equip new labor entrants with the skills the market needs; and improve their access to productive inputs, such as land, finance, and professional connections. Policy measures to combat joblessness could often have much more importance for youth than other age groups. But the SEE6 policy agenda to address youth unemployment and inactivity is not an isolated agenda; it is an agenda for higher overall employment with specific elements for youth. Therefore, measures promoting overall job creation should be complemented, not replaced, by measures focused on youth.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-11-30;en;;;;"151;150;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25375;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25375/1/110291-youthunemployment.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25375/110291-youthunemployment.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/25415;Indonesia Market Study;Movable Assets-Based Financing to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises;The report aims to assess the current market for movable assets based lending with respect to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia. The sections of the report highlight the addressable demand for MSMEs and the current supply provided by various formal sources of financing in Indonesia. Traditionally, financial institutions have preferred lending against fixed asset collateral only. Using that as a starting point, the report seeks to identify the current challenges in lending against movable assets. It further extends the need for a greater financial infrastructure that can facilitate the ability of lenders to evaluate risks in movable assets based lending. This report delves into the lending challenges faced by MSMEs as well as the challenges that restrict greater supply of credit by financial institutions. It draws on data and insights based on discussions with over 70 financial institutions in Indonesia, and an understanding of the credit requirements of MSMEs – based on over 850 sample cases for quantitative data. These findings were further examined through in-depth qualitative discussions with 34 MSMEs spread across multiple regions in Indonesia. As the Indonesian economy follows a traditional model of providing credit based on fixed collateral, such as land and buildings, the study focuses on: (i) understanding the current credit demand that can be potentially addressed by movable assets to complement the traditional model, and (ii) the challenges that need to be addressed to facilitate the ensuing movable assets based lending.;;International Finance Cooperation;International Finance Corporation;World Bank Group;2014-09-30;en;;;;"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25415;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25415/1/109548-WP-Indonesia-Market-Study-Movable-Assets-based-Financing-to-MSMEs-PUBLIC.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25415/109548-WP-Indonesia-Market-Study-Movable-Assets-based-Financing-to-MSMEs-PUBLIC.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;International Finance Corporation ;
handle:10986/25448;Intra-Household Dynamics and the Design of Social Protection Programs;The Case of Polygamous Households in North Burkina Faso;A recent overview of World Bank social safety net programs and gender highlighted the need for greater consideration of intra-household dynamics in the design of social protection programs (Bardasi 2014). During program design, decisions have to be made about who to target, how much and how often to give cash transfers, and what measures should accompany cash transfers. These decisions become even more complex in the context of polygamous households. The conclusions above are meant to illustrate important links between intra-household dynamics and the design of cash transfer programs. As a preliminary study, this research did not capture the actual effects of cash transfers. It is important to remember that money received from the government in the form of a regular cash transfer may be treated differently than income from other sources. Additional research is planned that will measure differences in the use of cash transfers depending on the social protection program design.;"Guilbert, Nathalie

handle:10986/25451;Female Entrepreneurs Who Succeed in Male-Dominated Sectors in Ethiopia;;In developing countries, female entrepreneurs have low returns. Yet, the few women who cross over into traditionally male-dominated sectors double their profits. So why don't more women cross over? When parents and husbands support them, women are more likely to cross over. When they lack information on the earnings potential in male-dominated sectors, they are less likely to. This suggests a path to promote women entrepreneurs crossing over. The challenges Ethiopian women face in getting jobs and earning income come from a range of sources. Women start from a more difficult situation than men --without easy access to finance, land, training, education and effective business networks. The share of women in Ethiopia without education is almost twice that of men, which in turn limits women entrepreneurs' ability to grow their businesses. Reducing gender inequalities in education and the labor market could increase annual GDP growth in Ethiopia by around 1.9 percentage points.;"Alibhai, Salman

handle:10986/25452;Costing the Gender Gap;;In sub-Saharan Africa women comprise a large proportion of the agricultural labor force, yet they are consistently found to be less productive than male farmers. The gender gap in agricultural productivity-measured by the value of agricultural produce per unit of cultivated land-ranges from 4-25 percent, depending on the country and the crop.1 The World Bank Africa Gender Innovation Lab, UN Women, and the UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative jointly produced a report to quantify the cost of the gender gap and the potential gains from closing that gap in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda. This report illustrates why the gender gap matters. Closing the gender gap of 28 percent in Malawi, 16 percent in Tanzania and 13 percent in Uganda could result in gross gains to GDP, along with other positive development outcomes, such as reduced poverty and greater food security. However, it is important to stress that these potential gains do not come without cost. Closing the gender gap will require changing existing or designing new policies, which may require additional resources.;"Goldstein, Markus

handle:10986/25453;Securing Property Rights for Women and Men in Rural Benin;;Women in Sub-Saharan Africa are less likely than men to own land. They also use less land and have lower tenure security over the land that they use. This gap is costly in terms of lost productive output. The early results showed that improved tenure security through land demarcation increased long-term investments in cash crops and trees and erased the gender gap in land fallowing - a key soil fertility investment. It is important that interventions cover as much of a household’s landholdings as possible: the authors found that some women shifted their agricultural production to plots of land that did not benefit from demarcation so that they can guard these less secure and less productive plots. The rural land use plans (plans fonciers ruraux (PFR)) in Benin represent a more decentralized, low-cost approach to land rights formalization. The PFR program is innovative in its focus on the formalization of existing customary rights of individual landholders. The objectives of the program are to improve tenure security and stimulate agricultural investment in rural areas. The World Bank’s Africa gender innovation lab, in collaboration with researchers from the development research group and the Paris school of economics, set out to evaluate the PFR program’s impact through a randomized controlled trial. This study provides the first set of experimental evidence on the causal impact of a large-scale land formalization program.;"Goldstein, Markus

handle:10986/25459;Gender Dimensions in Nigerian Agriculture;;With a fast growing population requiring an ever growing supply of food, a national poverty rate of 63 percent, and a labor force that is dominated by agricultural work, Nigeria's efforts to boost agricultural productivity could not be better timed. Though women constitute a large share of the agricultural labor force in Nigeria, little is known about their activities, roles, and constraints in the sector. By thoroughly assessing their agricultural activities, it will help to determine not only what women are doing in the sector, but how best to reduce their constraints and increase productivity. This policy brief, the first in a series of two, investigates the role of women in Nigerian agriculture using the first dataset to capture a comprehensive picture of agriculture across the nation of Nigeria. It finds that women are heavily involved in the production of both, staple (food) crops and cash crops, the agricultural value chain, and livestock production. However, women earn and produce much less than men, and have limited access to land, inputs, labor, and extension services.;"Oseni, Gbemisola

handle:10986/25460;Explaining Gender Differentials in Agricultural Production in Nigeria;;Nigeria presents a unique case study on differences in agricultural productivity between men and women. This study, which captures a comprehensive picture of agriculture across the nation, shows that female farmers produce 16 percent less per hectare than their male counterparts, when plot size, farmer characteristics, and inputs are taken into account. This gender gap is driven by the North East and Central zones located in the Northern region of the country, where female farmers are 28 percent less productive than male farmers. In this region, women, particularly those who are older, farm on smaller plots and have lower levels of key inputs, notably fertilizer and labor, which is a well-documented pattern in many African contexts. The Southern region, however, does not fit this established pattern. When controlling for key characteristics and factors of production, in the South no gender gap in productivity is observed, though female farmers will benefit from additional herbicide and female labor. The notably different patterns in these two regions of the same country provide ample space for further study. Thus, in order to decrease the country-wide gender gap in production, the authors recommend extending access to fertilizer, hired labor, and cash crops to women - particularly those in the North.;"Oseni, Gbemisola

Private sector investors seek to earn a return on investment that is commensurate with the risk of the investment. Therefore one will be attracted to profitable opportunities with manageable risk. Steps China can take to attract private capital for railway development include: (i) creating a policy and legal environment that protects the interests of different types of investors in the railway sector; (ii) identifying and creating profitable railway markets and entities that are suitable for private sector investment; (iii) managing the perception of risk in railway activities and assets; (iv) promoting asset sharing opportunities; and (v) expanding public private partnerships (PPPs) in rail assets and services.";"Lawrence, Martha

handle:10986/25484;High-Speed Rail, Regional Economics, and Urban Development in China;;Traditional economic evaluations of major transport infrastructure investments focus on the direct costs and benefits arising from travel, including user time savings, operator cost savings, and reductions in externalities including air pollution, noise, and accidents. There is an emerging consensus that major transport investments may have significant impacts that are not well captured by this type of conventional cost-benefit analysis. In China, the World Bank transport team has supported both econometric studies and on-the-ground surveys that begin to identify and quantify these impacts in the context of China's emerging High Speed Rail (HSR) program. Based on this and other research, the Bank team has begun to pilot a methodology to evaluate wider economic development benefits for several HSR projects, and has found them to be significant - of the same order as, but additional to the direct transport benefits that are traditionally measured. Crucially, these benefits of larger and better connected markets accrue to businesses and individuals even when they themselves do not travel. This paper highlights this research and methodology and the policy implications related to maximizing these benefits in practice.;"Salzberg, Andrew

An impact evaluation of this program highlights four main effects; namely, 1) significant and large investment impacts that are particularly pronounced for women; 2) improved land access for legally married women and better recordation of inheritance rights; 3) a reduction in the probability of having documented land ownership for legally unmarried women; and 4) a reduction in land market activity rather than distress sales. A primary reason for the Government of Rwanda to initiate LTR was to increase levels of land tenure security. LTR also demonstrated a major impact on inheritance related knowledge and awareness. Authors found a significant increase in the likelihood that landholders in the program areas would now know who would inherit their parcel.";"Ali, Daniel Ayalew

handle:10986/25748;Taking Stock, December 2016;An Update on Vietnam's Recent Economic Developments;Over recent decades, Vietnam’s agricultural sector has made enormous progress, realizing major gains in productivity and output and contributing to national goals related to food security, poverty reduction, social stability, and trade. Nevertheless, there are growing concerns related to the quality and sustainability of Vietnam’s agricultural growth and related patterns of development. A comparatively low quality of growth is manifested by low smallholder farmer profitability, considerable under-employment among agricultural workers, mixed or uncertain product quality and food safety, low value addition, and limited technological or institutionalinnovation. Some agricultural growth has come at the expense of the environment in the forms of deforestation, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In most locations, agricultural growth has involved an increase in cropping areas or intensities and ever higher uses of inputs and natural resources. Hence, more output has come from more and more inputs and increasing environmental costs. Vietnamese agriculture now sits at a turning point. The sector now faces growing domestic competition—from cities, industry, and services—for labor, land and water. Rising labor costs are beginning to inhibit the sector’s ability to compete internationally as a low cost producer of bulk undifferentiated commodities. The country’s ruralyouth have rising aspirations for living standards. Vietnam’s expanding consumer class and trade partners are expecting higher standards, both for products and production practices. Going forward, Vietnam’s agriculture will need to generate ‘more from less’. That is, it will need to generate more economic value—and farmer and consumer welfare—using less natural and human resources and without degrading the environment. It will need to rebrand itself and increasingly compete on the bases of innovation, reliable supply, predictable quality, and assured food safety and environmental protection.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-12-31;en;"land use;climate change";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;VNM;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25748;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25748/1/110676-WP-PUBLIC.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25748/110676-WP-PUBLIC.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/25780;Nigeria;Developing Housing Finance;"This report summarizes the results of the analytical work on housing market finance carried out by the World Bank Group at the request of the Ministry of Finance. The purpose of the work was to inform the policy dialogue about how best to develop a sustainable housing finance market in Nigeria, and improve the effectiveness of interventions aimed at stimulating the housing market and providing quality housing to the population. The work was funded by DFID and carried out over 2013 and 2014. Experience has shown that an increase in housing production, especially at the lower reaches of the market, stimulates job creation, both skilled and unskilled; and that housing and other infrastructure investment is strongly linked to economic growth. While the availability of housing finance is essential for increasing housing production, sustainable and equitable housing production also depends on: (a) access to residential lands and basic services; (b) an efficient and transparent land administration; (c) legal protections; and (d) a macroeconomic environment that maintains low inflation and low interest rates. An essential part of making housing finance work for the poor is the availability of houses at lower prices in the market. The report summarizes the institutional landscape, policy framework, and public and private sector actors involved in housing finance, and focuses on the underlying reasons for the lack of housing finance, particularly for lower-priced houses for the poor. The report also summarizes issues related to the construction industry and building materials, an understanding of which is key to developing transformative policies in the sector. Finally, the report proposes possible new approaches to housing finance in Nigeria, based on international best practices.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-12-31;en;"poverty;land rights;land administration;land use";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;NGA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25780;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25780/1/110897-WP-P131973-PUBLIC-HousingFinanceNigeriaweb.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25780/110897-WP-P131973-PUBLIC-HousingFinanceNigeriaweb.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/25803;Matchmaking in Nairobi;The Role of Land Use;Well-functioning cities reduce the economic distance between people and economic opportunities. Cities thrive because they enable matchmaking -- among people, among firms, and between people and job opportunities. This paper examines employment accessibility in Nairobi, Kenya and evaluates whether modification of land use patterns can contribute to increases in aggregate accessibility. The assessment is based on simulation of counterfactual scenarios of the location of jobs and households throughout the city without new investments in housing or transport infrastructure. The analysis finds that modifications to the spatial layout of Nairobi that encourage land use clustering can increase the share of overall opportunities that can be accessed within a given time-frame. When commuters travel by foot or using the minibus network, the share of accessible economic opportunities within an hour doubles from 11 to 21 percent and from 20 to 42 percent respectively. The analysis also finds that spatial layouts that maximize the number of households that have access to a minimum share of jobs, through a more even jobs-housing balance, come at the expense of average accessibility. This result is interpreted as a trade-off between inclusive and efficient labor markets.;"Avner, Paolo

To allow for comparability across very diverse cities, this work looks at the above mentioned cities through the lens of several spatial indicators and relies heavily on data derived from satellite imagery. First, it focuses on understanding the distribution of population across the city, and more specifically how the variations in population density could be linked to transportation. Second, it takes a closer look at the land cover in each city using a semi-automated texture based land cover classification that identifies neighborhoods that appear more regular or irregularly planned. Lastly, for the higher resolution images, this work studies the changes in the land cover classes as one moves from the city core to the periphery. This work also explored the classification of slightly coarser resolution imagery which allowed analysis of a broader number of cities, sixteen, provided the lower cost.;"Antos, Sarah E.

handle:10986/25826;Expanding Access to Finance for Small-Scale Businesses;Secured Transactions Reform--An Indonesia Case Study;A lack of access to finance has been one of the biggest impediments to the development and growth of the small-scale business sector in Indonesia. While micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for almost all employment in Indonesia (97 percent), the sector as a whole accounts for just about 57 percent of Gross National Product. Surveys suggest that one of the main constraints on the growth of the sector is a lack of access to finance, with almost half of Indonesian MSMEs citing access to finance as the top constraint to business growth. In 2012 the World Bank Group (WBG), in partnership with Switzerland and Japan, engaged with the Government of Indonesia to improve access to finance for the small-scale sector by enabling the use of movable collateral for formal lending. The use of movable collateral, such as vehicles, machinery, equipment, inventory or livestock, make it possible for enterprises and individuals who lack fixed collateral, such as land and property, to access finance. It also supports the growth of the financial sector, as it promotes portfolio diversification. This case study shows how the World Bank Group’s specialist team in Indonesia engaged with the government to promote an enabling environment and develop a sound secured transactions infrastructure to increase access to finance for the MSME sector.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-01-05;en;;;;"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25826;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25826/1/111735-WP-PUBLIC-ABSTRACT-SENT-by-Gillette-Conner.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25826/111735-WP-PUBLIC-ABSTRACT-SENT-by-Gillette-Conner.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

To answer the question, the study combines an Oaxaca-type decomposition of wage differentials into characteristics and coefficients effects with a multinomial logit model for self-selection into labor force participation and the public or private sector. The study finds that the public/private wage differential is sizeable but can entirely be accounted for by observable characteristics.

However, this finding contrasts the standard literature insofar as the quality of the destination country's business climate is insignificant, and weak tenure security is associated with increased interest for investors to acquire land in the country. Policy implications are discussed.";"Arezki, Rabah

handle:10986/25862;South East Europe Regular Economic Report, No. 9S, Fall 2016;Ten Messages About Youth Employment in South East Europe;"Today, nearly half of youth in the six South East European countries (SEE6) are not in the labor market, and one quarter is inactive—not in employment, education, or training. These poor outcomes partly reflect a difficult recovery in SEE6 from the 2008 global financial crisis, which sent already high youth unemployment soaring to new heights. This paper presents 10 evidence-based messages on the youth employment challenges in SEE6. The 10 messages demonstrate that many factors disproportionately affect jobless youth. Often young people bear the brunt of the structural and cyclical vulnerabilities that are embedded in the functioning of labor markets in the region. But the challenges faced by cyclically unemployed and structurally jobless young people in SEE6 differ, and so do the policy responses to address them. For the former, it is vital to keep youth engaged in the labor market during recessions and build their human capital while the labor market recovers. For the latter, the policy agenda is deeper; it is necessary to address the disincentives to work and hire youth embedded in exclusionary labor regulations and labor taxation; equip new labor entrants with the skills the market needs; and improve their access to productive inputs, such as land, finance, and professional connections. Policy measures to combat joblessness could often have much more importance for youth than other age groups. But the SEE6 policy agenda to address youth unemployment and inactivity is not an isolated agenda; it is an agenda for higher overall employment with specific elements for youth. Therefore, measures promoting overall job creation should be complemented, not replaced, by measures focused on youth.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-11-30;en;;;;"151;150;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25862;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25862/1/110291-REVISED-NWP-PUBLIC.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25862/110291-REVISED-NWP-PUBLIC.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/25896;Africa's Cities;Opening Doors to the World;Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing rapid population growth. Yet their economic growth has not kept pace. Why? One factor might be low capital investment, due in part to Africa’s relative poverty: Other regions have reached similar stages of urbanization at higher per capita GDP. This study, however, identifies a deeper reason: African cities are closed to the world. Compared with other developing cities, cities in Africa produce few goods and services for trade on regional and international markets To grow economically as they are growing in size, Africa’s cities must open their doors to the world. They need to specialize in manufacturing, along with other regionally and globally tradable goods and services. And to attract global investment in tradables production, cities must develop scale economies, which are associated with successful urban economic development in other regions. Such scale economies can arise in Africa, and they will—if city and country leaders make concerted efforts to bring agglomeration effects to urban areas. Today, potential urban investors and entrepreneurs look at Africa and see crowded, disconnected, and costly cities. Such cities inspire low expectations for the scale of urban production and for returns on invested capital. How can these cities become economically dense—not merely crowded? How can they acquire efficient connections? And how can they draw firms and skilled workers with a more affordable, livable urban environment? From a policy standpoint, the answer must be to address the structural problems affecting African cities. Foremost among these problems are institutional and regulatory constraints that misallocate land and labor, fragment physical development, and limit productivity. As long as African cities lack functioning land markets and regulations and early, coordinated infrastructure investments, they will remain local cities: closed to regional and global markets, trapped into producing only locally traded goods and services, and limited in their economic growth.;"Lall, Somik Vinay

handle:10986/25907;Enterprise Surveys;Lesotho Country Profile 2016;The Enterprise Surveys (ES) focus on many aspects of the business environment. These factors can be accommodating or constraining for firms and play an important role in whether an economy’s private sector will thrive or not. An accommodating business environment is one that encourages firms to operate efficiently. Such conditions strengthen incentives for firms to innovate and to increase productivity, key factors for sustainable development. A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public investment in health, education, and other services. Questions contained in the ES aim at covering most of the topics mentioned above. The topics include infrastructure, trade, finance, regulations, taxes and business licensing, corruption, crime and informality, access to finance, innovation, labor, and perceptions about obstacles to doing business.

handle:10986/25927;Voices of Women Entrepreneurs in Tanzania;;The Government of Tanzania is committed to supporting women entrepreneurs with both policy and practical support. The Government of Tanzania has made impressive strides in supporting women entrepreneurs, and its policies reflect a commitment to advancing women. The Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Marketing, which commissioned this report, has established special initiatives to reach out to women, and government supported organizations such as the Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO) have been working to empower women entrepreneurs through training and access to credit. One crucial recommendation is to improve women's access to finance by encouraging existing commercial banks to establish gender-sensitive programs and lines of credit for women entrepreneurs. To improve women's access to trade, the report recommends implementing gender analysis in the formulation of trade and economic growth policies, and providing training for women entrepreneurs on international buyer requirements and other relevant information, to facilitate their exports to international markets.

handle:10986/25978;Agriculture in Nicaragua;Performance, Challenges, and Options;This work summarizes background papers prepared for the World Bank Group with significant input from government counterparts and other development partners. It takes stock of major recent developments and argues that a lot has been achieved in the last decade in terms of production of commodities for export and food consumption, with favorable impact on rural poverty reduction. It also argues that the two factors driving the recent agricultural performance, namely favorable international prices and expansion of the agricultural frontier, have reached their limits. So while trade policies are broadly on target, much can be done by focusing on the productivity of small family agriculture and improving competitiveness by reducing transaction costs (logistics) affecting small, medium, and large commercial farms. In the short to medium term, the household income of the rural poor will continue to depend largely on agriculture. Thus interventions will need to take into account the heterogeneity of smallholder agriculture while simultaneously increasing its resilience to climate risks through climate-smart agriculture.;Piccioni, Norman Bentley;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2015-11-30;en;"sustainable development;rural population;forestry;research;farmers;farmland;food security;climate change;deforestation;agriculture;farming systems;rural development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"NIC;419";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25978;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/25978/2/102989.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25978/102989.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/25981;Improving Women’s Access to Land and Financial Resources in Tajikistan;;Since independence in 1991, the Government of Tajikistan has embarked on a land reform program, which includes extensive farm restructuring. Given the demography of rural households in Tajikistan where the phenomenon of female-headed households is quite significant, women ‘s access to land and credit assumes special importance. To date, however, no thorough gender analysis of access to land and finance in Tajikistan has been conducted. As a result, there is insufficient gender disaggregated data to inform policy. It is not clear how effective the reforms are in addressing factors inhibiting women ‘s access to land and their ability to benefit from any changes. In addition, due to the lack of data, no comprehensive microeconomic study on access to finance has been done. Many Tajik women are sole heads of households and caretakers of their families as a direct consequence of war and migration. Migration in particular has a great impact on gender relations, gender division of labor, and gender roles with the possible empowerment or disempowerment of women left behind. Households headed by women in Tajikistan are 28.6 percent more likely to be poorer than those headed by men. Improving and securing access to land and ensuring the gender sensitivity of land reforms, therefore, has potential for improving the conditions of these vulnerable households. The reports propose several areas of action. While fostering women ‘s access to agricultural production can be considered a policy for improving basic welfare, access to finance is an important ingredient for increased productivity and farm growth (i.e., professionalization and potentially commercialization). Financial access opens up opportunities to diversify income generation beyond farming activities. Complementary initiatives for women ‘s empowerment support their access to productive assets and entrepreneurial standing in society, and may simultaneously lift women ‘s self-constraints in demand for finance.;"Shahriari, Helen

handle:10986/25987;Gender and Economic Growth Assessment for Ghana 2007;;"This study presents an assessment of the role of gender in economic growth in Ghana with emphasis on constraints to enterprise operations, investment, and growth among women owned firms. Anecdotal evidence suggests that women own up to a third of businesses in Africa, and that this represents a significant source for scaling up economic growth in such countries. In Ghana, women make up about 50.1 percent of the entire labor force and are mostly involved in micro enterprises and the retail trade. In spite of the fact that gender issues in Ghana have been given significant attention over the last decade in particular; and that Ghana ranks relatively well in terms of gender equity, there remains a number of legal, administrative, and institutional barriers that impede the growth of women-owned businesses and for that matter women in general to attain their full potential. This report was undertaken for the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs (MOWAC) and coordinated by the International Finance Corporation (IFC’s) Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa under the gender-entrepreneurship markets initiative. The study was conducted between July and November 2006. Most economically-active women in Ghana operate in the informal economy and are mostly involved in micro-enterprises and retail trade. Women in the informal sector tend to be located in the poorer segments of the economy, particularly in food crop farming and the micro enterprises sector. The general legal framework for property rights and business formation in Ghana does not contain explicit provisions that inhibit women’s economic participation.

The study findings are based on analysis of results from a survey of 493 households in nine novostroiki established from 1989-1991, as well as focus group findings, a study of the institutional framework, and a study of sanitation. In interpreting the survey results, it is important to keep in mind that households in more recently established novostroiki face more difficulties than older novostroiki where residents have had more time to address their problems.

handle:10986/26070;Urban Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement;Linking Innovation and Local Benefits;Expansion and development of urban areas require acquisition of land, which, in turn, often requires physical relocation of people who own or occupy this land. Land acquisition and resettlement may also be required to improve the lives of the more than 1 billion people who currently live in slums around the world, most of them in developing countries. Therefore, any effort to embark on significant, sustainable urban development needs to ensure that there are adequate processes for land acquisition and, so that resettlement does not become a constraint to much needed urban development. Planners, policy makers and social scientists can try to implement urban development programs in a way that make people who lose their land, houses or livelihoods become equal partners in the development process. The combination of the high price of urban land, presence of creative individuals in close proximity in urban areas, and the ability of urban space to generate innovative solutions, can help convert urban resettlement into a development opportunity for all. The report illustrates how urban resettlement can become a development opportunity. The Mumbai example shows how the private sector can play a key role, to unleash the potential created by high-value land to provide sustainable housing solutions to those adversely affected, at no cost to the government or the resettlers. Examples from Morocco and Pakistan show how well designed and implemented, citizen-driven resettlement can result in enhanced skills and livelihoods, and can promote overall sustainable urban development. The Mauritania example demonstrates how collective approaches with strong community participation can help address difficult challenges related to housing. The Brazil case shows how resettlement practices with demonstrated, strongly positive outcomes and contributions to urban development can influence governments to incorporate them into their own laws and regulations, helping millions of affected people to benefit from them.;"Roquet, Vincent

handle:10986/26073;Institutional Approaches to Electrification;The Experience of Rural Energy Agencies/Rural Energy Funds in Sub-Saharan Africa;Energy poverty is a global problem: access to energy services is crucial to meet basic household needs, deliver and access public services, and generate income. Less than 10 percent of Sub-Saharan (SSA) rural households have access to electricity, with an overall access rate below 25 percent. One of the main obstacles for SSA electrification practitioners is the difficulty in obtaining practical and timely knowledge on how to overcome economic, technical, institutional, and political barriers to electrification in their day-to-day work. Launched in 2008, the Africa Electrification Initiative (AEI) seeks to create and sustain a living body of practical knowledge and a network of SSA practitioners for the design, development, and implementation of rural, peri-urban, and urban on-grid and off-grid electrification programs. AEI supports the network by organizing workshops and promoting online discussions and knowledge exchanges on topics important for its members. The workshop set out to address a number of relevant electrification topics previously identified through in-depth discussions and ongoing knowledge exchanges among a growing network of SSA practitioners. The workshop's main focus was on ground-level implementation of different institutional approaches to electrification, with particular focus on the experiences of rural energy agencies/rural energy funds (REAs/REFs) across SSA. The workshop lasted two and a half days, comprising 21 sessions, including regular session panels and discussion clinics with a longer duration. It also featured exhibition space for posters submitted by participating institutions, an expo of approved lighting products from the lighting Africa program, and an awards ceremony to recognize the best papers submitted by SSA electrification practitioners in response to the AEI call for papers.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-04-30;en;"capacity building;land ownership;transaction costs";;;"002;202";"Reports & Research;Conference Reports;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26073;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26073/1/763820WP0P11090s0to0Electrification.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26073/763820WP0P11090s0to0Electrification.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26074;Botswana Development Policy Review;An Agenda for Competitiveness and Diversification;"Botswana has been one of the most successful countries in the developing world over the last 40 years by many measures. Incomes have grown at a sustained pace, poverty has fallen, and the citizenry has become more educated. To be sure, poverty and income inequalities remain a problem, but rising standards of living have meant a better life for this generation of Batswana than any before it. The question facing the country leadership is whether this commendable performance can be sustained into the next generation. There are clouds on the horizon that cannot be ignored. Diamond earnings, the life blood of decades of prosperity, have flattened out. In per capita terms they are falling. Moreover, because revenues from diamonds going to the public sector have been falling for more than a decade, a growth model predicated upon an ever expanding state presence is not viable. Diamond earnings accruing to the state for subsequent redistribution have peaked. Employment and wages in the public sector have reached their natural limits as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); recycling revenues from mining into the private sector, either directly or through the financial sector, has been inefficient with low social returns; and redistributive mechanisms to support social safety nets are also likely be approaching their limits.

The narrative of Uganda’s continued, albeit it slightly slower, progress in reducing poverty since 2006 is less familiar. This was a period in which growth slowed as the gains from reforms years earlier had been fully realized, and weak infrastructure and increasing corruption increasingly constrained private sector competitiveness (World Bank 2015). This report examines Uganda’s progress in reducing poverty, with a specific focus on the period 2006 to 2013. The report shows that high growth from 2006 to 2010 benefited poverty reduction. Before turning in further detail to the key findings of the report, it is important to note that the analysis undertaken in this report is only possible because the Government of Uganda has invested in a high quality series of household surveys to document progress in wellbeing since 1993. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics has conducted high-quality household surveys that every three to four years that have provided a comparable series of data on poverty and other household characteristics for the last twenty years. Uganda is one of the few countries in the region to have achieved this level of comparable, frequent poverty monitoring over time. Without this, it would not be possible to document the lessons Uganda provides.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-09-30;en;"land reform;rural population;land ownership;farmers;rural areas;poverty;rural development;land management";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"002;UGA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26075;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26075/1/ACS18391-v1-REVISED-PUBLIC-poverty-assessment-report-2016-book-final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26075/ACS18391-v1-REVISED-PUBLIC-poverty-assessment-report-2016-book-final.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26077;Geography of Poverty in Mali;;This study discusses the impact of economic geography and (low) population density on development outcomes in Mali and explores how policies to reduce poverty can be made more effective by taking these two factors into account. The crisis in north Mali which started in 2012 and continues to date has brought questions of economic geography to the center of attention. To help answer such questions, and to analyze how to reduce poverty in Mali as a whole, this study uses different sources of information to analyze the diversity of livelihood patterns, in access to services and in living standards. The study uses quantitative information from household surveys, population and firm censuses, administrative and geographic data, and qualitative information about livelihoods. This study argues that the authorities will need to employ all three policy instruments, while emphasizing that if the objective is poverty reduction, most attention should be focused on spatially blind approaches. The study is organized as follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two emphasizes differences in population density which allows distinguishing between types of agglomeration from villages, to rural town, to large cities. Chapter three categorizes the country into various livelihood zones and considers how the agro-physical environment affects the way people live. In chapter four authors turn to household welfare. Chapter five considers access to services.

handle:10986/26078;Africa Can Help Feed Africa;Removing Barriers to Regional Trade in Food Staples;"Africa's growing demand for food has been met increasingly by imports from the global market. This, coupled with rising global food prices, brings ever-mounting food import bills. In addition, population growth and changing demand patterns will double demands over the next 10 years. Two key issues must be addressed: (a) establishing a consistent and stable policy environment for regional trade in fertilizers; and (b) investing in institutions that reduce the transaction costs of coordination failures. Many countries have enacted new fertilizer laws in recent years, but few have provided the resources to define and enforce regulations through standards and testing capacity. This report shows that reducing regulatory burdens on fertilizers and the consequent increase in use of fertilizers will have substantial impacts on returns to farmers, with consequent impacts on poverty. The report highlights the range of barriers to food trade in Africa along the entire value chain. The issues pertain to many ministries and agencies within government: trade, agricultural, health and safety, transport, and finance. This in turn requires a ""whole of government' approach to freeing up food trade, which will require strong and effective leadership to articulate the rationale and sustain the momentum for reform. Leaders must also address the hard choices that will arise in dealing with the political economy constraints that have until now blocked the capacity of Africa to exploit its enormous potential to feed Africans.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-10-31;en;"agriculture;climate change;farmers;food security;rural areas;transaction costs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"KEN;202;011;ZMB;UGA;ZWE;TZA;002;014;018;MWI;NER";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26078;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26078/1/733870WP0P12710n0Feed0Africa0Report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26078/733870WP0P12710n0Feed0Africa0Report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26079;Policy Brief;Opportunities and Challenges for Climate-Smart Agriculture in Africa;Agriculture is the economic foundation of many Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, employing about 60 percent of the workforce and contributing an average of 30 percent of gross domestic product. Yet agricultural growth rates for SSA declined in the 2000 and food insecurity remains a concern, with malnourishment only dropping from 34 to 30 percent in two decades. Various projections suggest that food production must increase by 70-100 percent by 2050 to meet the demands of a world with 9 billion people and changing diets. In SSA this will require considerable investments in agricultural development-research, institutional support and infrastructural development. Ensuring food security under a changing climate is one of the major challenges of our era. African agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture seeks to increase productivity in an environmentally and socially sustainable way, strengthen farmers' resilience to climate change, and reduce agriculture's contribution to climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon storage on farmland. Climate-smart agriculture includes proven practical techniques-such as mulching, intercropping, conservation agriculture, crop rotation, integrated crop-livestock management, agroforestry, improved grazing, and improved water management-but also innovative practices such as better weather forecasting, early warning systems and risk insurance. Climate-smart agriculture fully incorporates attention to climate risk management. Climate-smart agriculture offers some unique opportunities to tackle food security, adaptation and mitigation objectives. African countries will particularly benefit from climate-smart agriculture given the central role of agriculture as a means to poverty alleviation and the major negative impacts that climate change is likely to have on the African continent.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2013-12-31;en;"agriculture;climate change;deforestation;farmers;food security;forestry";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;2;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26079;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26079/1/762470WP0CSA0P00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26079/762470WP0CSA0P00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26080;Addis Ababa Urban and Metropolitan Transport and Land Use Linkages Strategy Review;;Since 2004 Ethiopia has experienced strong and generally broad-based real economic growth averaging 10.7 percent per annum. It is one of the most populous countries in the world, but it is not highly urbanized. Nevertheless, urbanization in Ethiopia is taking place rapidly, and is expected to increase over the coming few decades. Addis Ababa, is its commercial and political center and exemplary of the rapid urban growth of Ethiopia. The rapid urban and metropolitan growth in Addis Ababa is exacerbated by poor planning and land-use, inadequate infrastructure, and chronic housing shortage. A key challenge for housing in the Addis Ababa metropolitan area, and, indeed, of planning in general, is that lack of coordination with transportation. The one factor that has mitigated the growth in congestion has been that motorization rates in Addis Ababa are very low by global standards. Over the past seven years, Addis Ababa has been making a concerted effort to improve the urban transport situation, largely through large investments in new infrastructure, including roads, a new Light Rail Transit (LRT) system (under construction) and plans for a new Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, and improved standards and practices for improving and integrating pedestrian facilities in major transport capital projects. It has invested heavily in its road asset stock, with 26 percent of its capital investment budget dedicated to transport. These investments in the road network may provide less economic and mobility value for residents than their planners may have intended, for four reasons. Indeed, at the current low rates of motorization, the frequent and ubiquitous congestion in the city suggests substantial shortcomings in how traffic is managed, rather than a fundamental mismatch between transport supply and demand. In order to improve public transport, for the city’s largely non-motorized population, substantial investments in mass transport network have been made or identified. The current public transport provision/operation has a number of weaknesses, with governance being a critical one. Even though most trips in Addis Ababa are made by walking, facilities for pedestrians tend to be inadequate and substandard. Integrating transport with land-use development has also proven to be very difficult in Addis Ababa. In terms of overall urban development, although the Ethiopian government is making attempts at planning and catering for the rapid urban growth, urbanization still takes place largely in an unplanned/informal way. In recent years, the rate of spatial expansion of the city is outpacing the rate of population growth, resulting in a less than efficient overall physical form.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-09-18;en;land use;;Land Use, Management & Investment;"002;ETH";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26080;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26080/1/ACS12347-WP-P147972-PUBLIC-Box391453B-ACS.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26080/ACS12347-WP-P147972-PUBLIC-Box391453B-ACS.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26082;Growing Africa;Unlocking the Potential of Agribusiness;This report highlights the great potential of the agribusiness sector in Africa by drawing on experience in Africa as well as other regions. The evidence demonstrates that good policies, a conducive business environment, and strategic support from governments can help agribusiness reach its potential. Africa is now at a crossroads, from which it can take concrete steps to realize its potential or continue to lose competitiveness, missing a major opportunity for increased growth, employment, and food security. The report pursues several lines of analysis. First, it synthesizes the large body of work on agriculture and agribusiness in Africa. Second, it builds on a diagnosis of specific value chains. As part of this effort, the value chain for Africa's largest and fastest-growing food import, rice, is benchmarked in Senegal and Ghana against Thailand's rice value chain. Third, 170 agribusiness investments by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) in Africa and Southeast Asia are analyzed to gain perspective on the elements of success and failure. Fourth, the report synthesizes perspectives from the private sector through interviews with 23 leading agribusiness investors and a number of other key informants. In conclusion, the report offers practical policy advice based on the experience of countries from within and outside Africa. The huge diversity of Africa's agro-ecological, market, and business environments, however, necessarily means that each country (and indeed regions within countries) will need to adapt the broad guidance provided here to the local context.

handle:10986/26110;Mining in Africa;Are Local Communities Better Off?;This study focuses on the local and regional impact of large-scale gold mining in Africa in the context of a mineral boom in the region since 2000. It contributes to filling a gap in the literature on the welfare effects of mineral resources, which, until now, has concentrated more on the national or macroeconomic impacts. Economists have long been intrigued by the paradox that a rich endowment of natural resources may retard economic performance, particularly in the case of mineral-exporting developing countries. Studies of this phenomenon, known as the “resource curse,” examine the economy-wide consequences of mineral exports. Africa’s resource boom has lifted growth, but has been less successful in improving people’s welfare. Yet much of the focus in academic and policy circles has been on appropriate management of the macro-fiscal and governance risks that have historically undermined development outcomes. This study focuses instead on the fortune of local communities where resources are located. It aims to better inform public policy and corporate behavior on the welfare of communities in Africa in which the extraction of resources takes place.;"Chuhan-Pole, Punam

handle:10986/26149;Wood-Based Biomass Energy Development for Sub-Saharan Africa;Issues and Approaches;Nearly half the world's population and about 81 percent of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) households rely on wood-based biomass energy (fuel wood and charcoal) for cooking. This degree of reliance is far greater than in any other region. While the use of biomass fuels in China, India and much of the developing world has peaked or will do so in the near future, SSA's consumption will either remain at very high levels or even grow over the next few decades. Population growth, coupled with strong urbanization dynamics and relative price changes of alternative fuels, offset the important achievements made over the past decade by significant investments in energy access, rural and urban electrification, off-grid energy developments, and the promotion of alternative energy sources. With increasing economic development, the demand for energy is increasing as well and consumers depend on a broader portfolio of energy sources to satisfy growing energy needs. While electricity and other energy sources are needed to satisfy additional energy needs emerging with economic development, a vast majority of Sub-Saharan African consumers continue to use wood based biomass energy for cooking. Especially electricity is not regarded a suitable alternative for cooking given equipment and use costs. Biomass burning in cook stoves also emits black carbon (BC) as part of visible smoke, which is particulate matter that results from incomplete combustion. Climate science now views BC as the second or third largest warming agent after carbon dioxide, alongside methane. In the case of biomass cooking, the warming effects of BC and the cooling effects of organic carbon that is also emitted during the burning appear to be closely balanced. Given the present uncertainty about the net impact, additional research is currently underway. Black carbon has also an impact at the regional level: it accelerates melting of ice and snow, and contributes to regional pollution which can alter climatic conditions and precipitation patterns over a wide area. This paper advocates that any policy reform should entail a combination of clear rules, transparent enforcement, strong incentives and awareness-creation/capacity development. Key stakeholders and the general public need guidance by way of information campaigns, training, and demonstration projects to ensure that awareness-deficits or false perceptions do not curtail policy implementation. The bureaucratic and administrative barriers e.g. overcomplicated forest management planning requirements, complex fiscal systems and land tenure procedures may inhibit development and thus warrant critical reflection. The regulatory framework needs to integrate externalities in order to promote adequate pricing of charcoal, and thus enhance regional economies.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-09-30;en;"climate change;deforestation;forest law;forestry;land degradation;rural areas;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"002;202";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26149;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26149/1/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26149/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26154;The Challenge of Inclusion;;"This is the address to the Board of Governors, delivered by Mr. James D. Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, in Hong Kong, China, on September 23, 1997. This year's core theme is the challenge of inclusion, bringing people into society who have never been part of it before, the main reason why the World Bank Group exists. On reviewing the state of development circa 1997: despite improved social indicators, the rapid rise in life expectancy levels, and freedom ascending, much still needs to be improved. In East Asia, inequities between rural, and urban areas, and between the skilled, and unskilled are becoming more widespread; in the countries of the former Soviet Union, the old, and unemployed are more vulnerable amidst the turbulence caused by the transition to market economies; in parts of Latin America, unequal access to education, and health care, and disparities in income hinder progress; and, in many of the poorest countries, population growth continues to run ahead of economic growth. Considering the challenge ahead, the message for countries is to educate ""your"" people; ensure their health; give them voice, and justice; strong financial systems; and, sound economic policies, recognizing the link between good economic performance, and open governance, to build the broad social consensus. The effectiveness of the development community lies in building inclusive partnerships, between the governments, and the people, involving bilateral, and multilateral assistance, as well as nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector, based on good policy environments, with a look at renewing strategies. The Bank's responsiveness to this challenge has been that of commitment to the quality of work; increased accountability to measure performance; and, improved dialogue with governments. Key strategic points of change are to mainstream social issues, increase capacity building, forge sustainable development in agriculture; promote private sector participation, and strengthen financial systems.";Wolfensohn, James D.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;1997-09-23;en;"land reform;sustainable development;urban areas";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;;;Conference Papers & Reports;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26154;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26154/1/multi0page.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26154/multi0page.pdf.jpg?sequence=11&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank Group, discussed that it is crucial to have economic growth and it is crucial to adhere to policies which are tried and true in terms of balance, in terms of equilibrium, in terms of monetary, and fiscal policy. The real issues are how can one deal with poverty within the framework of environmental sustainability, with inclusive and sustainable programs, with participation, and with results that can make a big enough difference. In the last seven years there has been a fantastic change in the weighting between the net flow of funds from the official institutions compared with the private sector—to the point where today private sector flows are six times official flows. The Bank is trying to deal with these new interfaces: working with the clients in a more responsive and less dogmatic fashion; asking how one can differentiate between economies; building a knowledge bank so that the Bank can leverage knowledge as a key driver of development.";Wolfensohn, James D.;;;World Bank Group;1998-04-21;en;poverty;;;;Conference Papers & Reports;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26160;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26160/1/Remarks0at0the0lfensohn00President.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26160/Remarks0at0the0lfensohn00President.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The responsibilities of foundations do not end with our cities and communities. The job the Bank does can only be done on the basis of partnership with the governments, with the other multilateral institutions, with the private sector, but most particularly with civil society. It is crucial that the foundation organizations in the country that have the experience, that know about volunteerism, about taking things in their own hands, diversity of interests, different points of view, and experience, should come together on the global issues.;Wolfensohn, James D.;;;World Bank Group;1998-04-28;en;"environment;land;women";"Land & Gender;Land, Climate change & Environment";;USA;Conference Papers & Reports;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26161;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26161/1/Remarks0at0the0lfensohn00President.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26161/Remarks0at0the0lfensohn00President.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank Group, discussed what the Bank learned in coming to look at the issues of poverty and development. Development requires proper economic policies, but also the essential element of the social aspects and human aspects of society. The Bank’s focus is to think first in terms of poverty—fighting poverty with passion was adopted recently as the first line of our mission statement. Wolfensohn discussed an agenda for action on the issues of inclusion, corruption, transparency, education, knowledge, and private sector environment. How we attack this agenda must be a partnership between governments, multilaterals, such as the Bank, and the bilateral institutions, the private sector, and civil society in all its forms—from non-government organizations (NGOs) to trade unions, from religions to foundations, from spokesmen for ordinary people.;Wolfensohn, James D.;;;World Bank Group;1999-02-26;en;"corruption;land;poverty;women;farmers";Land & Gender;;"030;009;PRK";Conference Papers & Reports;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26164;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26164/1/Remarks0at0the0lfensohn00President.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26164/Remarks0at0the0lfensohn00President.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Latin American countries, being small economies, are very vulnerable to world pressures. After a huge drop in private sector finance, we’re seeing the first signs of return. What we need now is greater transparency and supervision in banking and the private sector—and a better common set of principles and standards. We need decent government, trained government, with capacity at all levels. We need legal systems that work. We must ensure social safety nets are in place.

handle:10986/26172;Coalitions for Change;;World Bank Group President, James Wolfensohn addressed the Board of Governors. In the past year the Bank launched a new initiative—the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF). The aim was to bring the social and the structural aspects of development together with the macroeconomic and the financial so as to establish a much more balanced and effective approach. The Bank will work with the broad development community—the United Nations, the European Union, bilaterals, regional development banks, civil society, and the private sector—to build genuine partnerships. The CDF is now being piloted in 13 countries. The general experience reviewed that strengthening the organization, human capacity, and the structure of the state, both at central and local levels, is the first priority to reduce poverty. The speaker also called for a coalition for change in the new international development architecture in the face of globalization.;Wolfensohn, James D.;;;World Bank Group;1999-09-28;en;"property rights;capacity building;corruption;property;youth;poverty;decentralization";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;Conference Papers & Reports;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26172;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26172/1/Address0to0the0oalitions0for0change.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26172/Address0to0the0oalitions0for0change.pdf.jpg?sequence=11&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26199;Hybrid Land Regulation between the Commons and the Market Land Tenure in the Comoros;;Following a chaotic political decolonization, from 1975 to 2000, the Comoros failed to sustain the extension of private land ownership pursued since the beginning of the twentieth century and to implement land reform prepared with the assistance of the FAO and the UNDP but abandoned after the assassination of the President of the Republic in 1989. This reform was based on a form of heritage management recognizing the plural and complementary nature of modes of securing land tenure. It was resumed at the beginning of the 1990s as a “reformation,” that is, an informal policy, and translated into best practice by Comorian agricultural engineers with a view to stabilizing and then improving the productivity of small family farms, which are overwhelmingly predominant in the three islands. In doing so, they came face to face with the “challenge of the commons” translated into new operational strategies while recognizing the diversity of groups, interests, and resources as well as the strongly hybrid nature of local management regulations that helped make customary norms and proprietary procedures complementary. The result was the coexistence of what can be called a “primo-commons” inherited from ancestral practices and a “neo-commons” influenced by the market and opening up the Comoros to international trade and modernity.;Le Roy, Étienne;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-01-31;en;"land;land tenure;land use;commons;land reform";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;014;COM";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26199;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26199/1/112917-WP-PUBLIC-WDR17BPLandtenureintheComoros.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26199/112917-WP-PUBLIC-WDR17BPLandtenureintheComoros.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26200;The Effect of Local Governance on Firm Productivity and Resource Allocation;Evidence from Vietnam;Governance quality plays a key role in private sector development: competent bureaucrats not only create good policies and regulations but also effectively implement them to shape the business environment. The authors exploit Vietnam’s decentralization of administrative tasks since the early 2000s to test this hypothesis. The authors examine how changes in the provincial administration of national business regulations affect firms through two channels: within firm productivity levels and resource allocation across firms. Their results show that better overall business environment has a positive impact on firm productivity, and this effect is driven by a reduction in corruption levels, the risks of land expropriation, and entry regulations. The authors also find that high productivity firms are generally more able to take advantage of the improvements in business environment. However, better implementation of entry regulations matters most for less productive firms. The authors do not find evidence for the impact of business environment quality on province-level market efficiency.;"Tan, Shawn W.

handle:10986/26224;Agribusiness Indicators;Zambia;"Agriculture and agribusiness play an important role in the Zambian economy, contributing around 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in recent years and about 12 percent of national export earnings. Agriculture employs nearly 70 percent of the labor force and remains the main source of income and employment for most of the people living in rural areas. The objective of the Zambia agribusiness indicators (ABI) country report is to examine factors that have affected agricultural productivity, market access, and the policy environment for agriculture in Zambia. This report presents findings of a data collection exercise carried out to compile a set of pilot ABI for Zambia. The pilot indicators presented are based on a review of the literature, government statistical bulletins, and primary interviews in the seed, fertilizer, mechanization, agricultural finance, and transport subsectors. The resulting indicators are presented in matrix form, together with notes indicating the specific data source (or sources) used for each indicator. A set of questionnaires was developed for this part of the exercise based on guidelines. Perception indicators on the quality of road infrastructure and other transport sector issues were added to supplement the checklist guidelines. The anticipated impact of the presentation of country performances will be to raise the competitiveness of African agriculture by bringing into sharper focus measures of how individual countries are transitioning towards a more commercial agriculture. This report consists of following seven chapters: chapter one gives introduction; chapter two presents access to and use of improved seed; chapter three focuses on fertilizer access and availability; chapter four focuses on access to farm machinery and tractor hire services; chapter five presents access to agricultural and agri-enterprise finance; chapter six gives cost and efficiency of transport in Zambia; and chapter seven presents policy and enabling environment for agribusiness development.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"agriculture;environment;farmers;food security;rural areas;urban areas";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"ZMB;002";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26224;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26224/1/825080WP0ABIZa00Box379865B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26224/825080WP0ABIZa00Box379865B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26247;Municipal Asset Management in China's Small Cities and Towns;Findings and Strategies Ahead;Chinese municipalities have developed a large stock of capital assets during a period of rapid growth and urbanization, but have yet to modernize asset management practices. Cities face challenges such as premature decline of fixed assets and spiking liabilities related to operating and maintaining assets. This paper evaluates the asset management practices in three selected small cities and towns in China, using a benchmarking assessment tool followed by an in-depth field assessment. The paper finds that overall performance is below half the international benchmark for good practice in all three cities. Management practices are considerably more advanced for land than for buildings and infrastructure. Key deficiencies in data availability and reporting, governance, capacity, and financial management indicate increased risks for local government finance and the delivery of public services. For small cities and towns where public revenues are often uncertain and limited, urban public services will be at risk of deterioration unless good asset management practices are put in place. The paper recommends strategic actions for upper and lower levels of government, to advance local asset management practices and facilitate the reform agenda.;"Campanaro, Alessandra

The timing is appropriate as it coincides with a transformation in the telecom infrastructure and services on the continent as fiber optic connectivity, both undersea and on land, is expanding at a rapid pace. The premise of the report that the organization of ICT services and connectivity is best provided by a dedicated organization called the National Research and Education Network (NREN) is based on international best practice and the current plans of the stakeholders in the region. In the following pages, the nature of NRENs and the case for their establishment is outlined and the story of their development in Africa up to their current status is described in operation of NRENs are discussed as a prelude to a guidance note on how to go about establishing or strengthening an NREN, with recommendations to the government, the private sector, institutions, and development partners.;Foley, Michael;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-12-31;en;;;;"002;202;NGA;KEN";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26258;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26258/1/113114-NRENSinAfrica-SABER-ICTno05.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26258/113114-NRENSinAfrica-SABER-ICTno05.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26271;Central America Urbanization Review;Making Cities Work for Central America;Central America is undergoing an important transition. Urban populations are increasing at accelerated speeds, bringing pressing challenges for development, as well as opportunities to boost sustained, inclusive and resilient growth. Today, 59 percent of the region’s population lives in urban areas, but it is expected that 7 out of 10 people will live in cities within the next generation. At current rates of urbanization, Central America’s urban population will double in size by 2050, welcoming over 25 million new urban dwellers calling for better infrastructure, higher coverage and quality of urban services and greater employment opportunities. With more people concentrated in urban areas, Central American governments at the national and local levels face both opportunities and challenges to ensure the prosperity of their country’s present and future generations. The Central America Urbanization Review: Making Cities Work for Central America provides a better understanding of the trends and implications of urbanization in the six Central American countries -Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama- and the actions that central and local governments can take to reap the intended benefits of this transformation. The report makes recommendations on how urban policies can contribute to addressing the main development challenges the region currently faces such as lack of social inclusion, high vulnerability to natural disasters, and lack of economic opportunities and competitiveness. Specifically, the report focuses on four priority areas for Central American cities: institutions for city management, access to adequate and well-located housing, resilience to natural disasters, and competitiveness through local economic development. This book is written for national and local policymakers, private sector actors, civil society, researchers and development partners in Central America and all around the world interested in learning more about the opportunities that urbanization brings in the 21st century.;"Maria, Augustin

handle:10986/26301;Securing Forest Tenure Rights for Rural Development :;Lessons from Six Countries in Latin America;Secure land tenure in rural landscapes is widely recognized as an essential foundation for achieving a range of economic development goals. However, forest areas in low and middle-income countries face particular challenges in strengthening the security of land and resource tenure. Forest peoples are often among the poorest and most politically marginalized communities in their national contexts, and their tenure systems are often based on customary, collective rights that have insufficient formal legal protection. This study on Securing Forest Tenure Rights for Rural Development aims to contribute to efforts worldwide to reduce poverty and strengthen sustainable management in forest areas. It does so by reviewing the progress of tenure reforms in six countries in Latin America, and drawing lessons to help advance the realization of these reforms and inform similar initiatives in other countries. The target audience of this work includespolicy-makers who have responsibility for forests, climate change, land tenure, agricultural development and poverty reduction programs in rural areas, as well as for civil society organizations and international partners working on land tenure and natural resource governance. The study also aims to assist and inform the work of World Bank programs in rural development, environment and natural resources, agriculture, social development, climate change, and carbon finance, by increasing attention and support to indigenous and community forest tenure as it relates to these areas of work.;"Segura Warnholtz, Gerardo

However, financing these systems can be a challenge, particularly in low-resource settings. Recognizing that landfill emissions are expected to rise into the foreseeable future, this report outlines a variety of ways that city governments, private landfill owners, or other project developers finance LFG management systems that mitigate these emissions. It is intended to offer policy-makers and practitioners an overview of financing models that have been used around the world and insights from existing projects, including key enabling conditions and risk mitigation strategies.;"Markgraf, Claire

handle:10986/26405;Transforming the Urban Space through Transit-Oriented Development;The 3V Approach;Imagine a city that is more competitive, with higher-quality neighborhoods, lower infrastructure costs, and lower C02 emissions per unit of activity. This city has lower combined transportation and housing costs for its residents than other cities at similar levels of economic activity. Its residents can access most jobs and services easily through a combination of low-cost public transport, walking and cycling. Its core economic and population centers are resilient to natural hazards. It is able to finance improvements to public space, connectivity, and social housing by capturing value created through integrated land use and transport planning. Such a vision has never been more relevant for rapidly growing cities than it is today. Transit-oriented development (TOD) can play a major role in achieving such a vision. Based on an observation of methodologies applied in different countries, the World Bank's Community of Practice on Transit Oriented Development has developed a methodology called the 3 Value (3V) Framework, which outlines a typology to facilitate TOD implementation at the metropolitan and urban scale in various contexts. The 3V Framework equips policy and decision makers with quantified indicators to better understand the interplay between the economic vision for the city, its land use and mass transit network, and urban qualities and market vibrancy around its mass transit stations. This book provides examples of approaches taken by cities like London and New York to align their economic, land use, and transport planning to generate jobs and high value. We hope this book will help readers develop a coherent vision, policies, and strategy to leverage the value created through enhanced connectivity and accessibility and make cities even more appealing places to live, work, play and do business.;"Salat, Serge

Historical accounts trace the root cause of land issues and identity-based conflict to the introduction of the Regalian doctrine of land ownership by Spanish colonizers. During the American colonial regime at the turn of the 20th century, dispossession of land held by the original inhabitants of Mindanao accelerated, with an emphasis of titling lands for private ownership that clashed with the tradition of ancestral domain. This was further exacerbated by migration instigated by the central government, starting with the development of ""agricultural colonies: in the early 1900s to 1940s, to the passage of a series of land reform laws from the 1960s until the end of the 1980s to encourage individual land titling as a strategy for agricultural development.

handle:10986/26491;State of Knowledge on Climate Change, Water, and Economics;;The current state of knowledge on climate change and water points to predominantly negative effects. This paper reviews the literature on these effects by geographical region and notes the differences as well as the uncertainties. An important feature is the fact that the climate effects will occur on top of water scarcity that currently prevails in many parts of the world. The impact of climate change on scarcity is present but generally small compared to the impact of the socioeconomic factors. Changes in efficiency of water use could make a big contribution to water problems, including those caused by climate change. In-depth estimates of damages from climate change related to water have been made to 2060 and, less accurately, to 2100. The 2060 estimates indicate that the impacts from water supply changes or changes in water-related extreme events and marine flows add up to about 1.5 of GDP in 2060 in the absence of mitigation or adaptation. This average figure, however, may be an underestimate of a number of reasons. Estimates to 2100 of potential damages in economic terms are even more uncertain but there are strong reasons to believe they will be greater as a percentage of GDP, perhaps around 10 globally and possibly even higher. Adaptation can make a major contribution to reducing damages from climate change for all mitigation scenarios, and more so when mitigation is absent or limited. Adaptation will require both private and public actions.;Markandya, Anil;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-04-30;en;"climate change;fisheries";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26491;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26491/1/114666-27-4-2017-11-18-31-W.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26491/114666-27-4-2017-11-18-31-W.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26506;Future of Food;Shaping the Food System to Deliver Jobs;Shaping the Food System to Deliver Jobs is the fourth paper in a series on The Future of Food. This paper focuses on how the food system can deliver jobs. It provides a framework for understanding the factors determining the number and quality of jobs in the food system, including inclusion of women and youth. It highlights a set of actions that countries can adopt, adapt, and apply to their own circumstances to enhance the food system’s contribution to jobs. The food system extends beyond farm production to include food storage, processing, distribution, transport, retailing, restaurants and other services. The paper finds that the food system employs the most people in many developing countries in both self and wage employment, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. In many countries the off-farm aspect of the food system accounts for a large share of the economy’s manufacturing and services sectors. While the employment share in farming tends to decline as per capita incomes rise, the share in food manufacturing and services tends to increase. Urbanization and per capita income growth offers significant new opportunities in non-cereal products and in new jobs in the food system beyond the farm.;"Townsend, Robert

handle:10986/26531;Making Women's Voices Count;Integrating Gender Issues in Disaster Risk Management - Overview and Resources for Guidance Notes;"The countries of East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) are among the most vulnerable in the world to the physical, social, and economic effects of natural disasters. Disaster impacts are not distributed uniformly within a population. Due to existing socio-economic conditions, cultural beliefs and traditional practices, women and men are affected differently. In many cases, the mortality rates for women in the aftermath of a disaster are much higher than those of men. For example, women represented an estimated 61 percent of fatalities in Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, 70 percent after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Banda Aceh, and 91 percent after Cyclone Gorky in Bangladesh in 1991. Failure to consider the different impact disaster have on women and men are likely to lead to overlooking the true costs of disasters and making disaster risk management (DRM) support less effective. Gender-blind responses can also reinforce, perpetuate and increase existing gender inequalities, making bad situations worse for women and other vulnerable groups. To make DRM effective, therefore, it is essential that both women and men's voices and needs are integrated on equal terms men in the design and implementation of DRM programs. To address key issues and bottlenecks for mainstreaming gender issues into disaster risk management projects; and to help teams design and implement gender dimensions into disaster risk management work, the infrastructure and social development groups of the World Bank's Sustainable Development Department in the East Asia and Pacific region have jointly produced a set of operationally relevant guidance notes for World Bank staff, clients and development partners. Grounded in extensive field work in Lao PDR and Vietnam, and drawing on the significant amount of material already available, these notes aim to condense a number of complex issues and themes to provide 'first stop' practical information.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-10-31;en;"capacity building;climate change;land administration;land rights;natural disasters;property rights";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;LAO;009;VNM";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26531;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26531/1/658410REVISED00view0Final0for0email.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26531/658410REVISED00view0Final0for0email.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/26550;Evaluation of New Fishery Performance Indicators;A Case Study of the Blue Swimming Crab Fisheries in Indonesia and Philippines;To further develop and finalize the Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) for scaling up to the Bank's entire fisheries portfolio, a number of specific pilots and case studies have been conducted. This report provides an overview of the FPIs, and a summary of two case studies in its application, the blue swimming crab (BSC) fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. A comparative analysis with an Icelandic lobster fishery is conducted as a benchmark, as the Icelandic lobster fishery is also export oriented and has been recognized as a well-managed fishery. The study is organized as follows: chapter two provides a brief introduction of FPIs and the blue swimming fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. Chapter three presents the results for FPIs that measure the success ('outputs') in achieving the 'triple bottom line' of environmental, social, and economic sustainability and provides a critical evaluation of strengths, weaknesses, and omissions of the current FPIs design. Chapter four presents the results for FPIs that measure factors ('inputs') that enable (or undermine) the likelihood that the triple bottom line will be achieved and provides a critical evaluation of strengths, weaknesses, and omissions of the current FPIs design chapter five summarizes the results and draws conclusions about the applicability of FPIs and next steps. Five appendices provide supplementary information. Appendix A provides detailed explanation of the rationale and measurement for each indicator. Appendix B lists additional suggested indicators based on the case studies. Appendix C lists the participants who have attended the workshops in London and Hawaii.

handle:10986/26552;Senegal Urban Floods;Recovery and Reconstruction since 2009;Senegal is located in the Sahel region of West Africa. Between 1970 and 2000, the country suffered prolonged droughts that contributed to rural exodus. Communities in these peri-urban areas, already among the poorest in the country, are the most vulnerable to episodes of heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding. The impact of floods in this situation of uncontrolled urban growth is exacerbated by the lack of a functional storm water drainage system, ineffective land-use policies and non-compliance with the urban planning and development master plan. The negative impact of flooding during the first decade of this century, especially those of 2005, 2009 and 2012, continue to be reflected in existing socio-economic conditions. The World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) are collaborating on a guide for Disaster Recovery Framework (DRF). This guide aims to help governments and partners plan for resilient post disaster recovery while contributing to longer-term sustainable development. It is based on practices gleaned from country experiences in disaster recovery around the world. Following the 2009 floods, the Government of Senegal elaborated its first recovery plan after a post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) was conducted with the support of the international community. This case study thus uses the 2009 exercise as the point of departure for examining Senegal’s policies for recovery and prevention of urban floods.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-08-31;en;"assessment;environment;climate change";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"002;SEN";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26552;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26552/1/114627-WP-PUBLIC-rfcs-2014-senegal.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26552/114627-WP-PUBLIC-rfcs-2014-senegal.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26561;Agribusiness Indicators;Tanzania;"Agriculture in Tanzania accounts for 28 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 80 percent of its labor force. The sector is also an important source of export revenues. The data and findings presented in this report provide a summary of the performance of the agriculture sector in Tanzania using a set of indicators covering six areas. These are: 1) access to and availability of certified seed; 2) availability of and access to fertilizer; 3) access to farm machinery, particularly tractor hire services for land preparation; 4) access to agricultural and agro-enterprise finance; 5) the cost and efficiency of transporting agricultural commodities; and 6) measures of policy certainty and uncertainty as perceived by private investors and the effects these have on the enabling environment for producers and agribusinesses. The Agribusiness Indicators (ABI) team conducted interviews with Government agencies, private firms (fertilizer importers, seed companies, tractor importers and distributors, transporters), commercial banks, farmer-based organizations, donors, and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The ABI program is pilot testing an initial set of indicators on the ease (or difficulty) of operating agribusinesses in African countries.

handle:10986/26562;Agribusiness Indicators;Ethiopia;"Because agriculture is the economic backbone of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, any meaningful sustainable development program in the continent must therefore be anchored in the sector. The concept for this study on agribusiness indicators was based on the vital role that agribusiness plays in agricultural development. The study focuses on agribusiness indicators (ABI) to identify and isolate the determining factors that lead private investors and other stakeholders to participate in agribusiness and to engage in discourse regarding its development. A more thorough empirical understanding of these determinants in turn can usefully inform the types of policy reforms that can promote agribusiness in Africa. In Ethiopia, the ABI team focused on the following success factors: a) access to critical factors of production of certified hybrid seeds, fertilizer, and mechanical input; b) enabling environment in terms of access of credit and transportation; and c) government expenditures on agriculture, and trade and regulatory policies that currently influence the agribusiness environment. The factors and indicators that the research team has included in this study are not exhaustive but rather are intended to serve as a pilot that could be scaled up to include more variables and countries. The findings of the study revealed the dominant role of the government in the seed and fertilizer markets. In the seed sub-sector, perennial shortages of both basic and certified seeds have greatly limited agricultural productivity in Ethiopia.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-04-30;en;"farmers;food security;forestry;land degradation;rural development;rural population;sustainable development;transaction costs";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"002;ETH";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26562;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26562/1/682370ESW0P1260ators0Ethiopia0final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26562/682370ESW0P1260ators0Ethiopia0final.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26563;Agribusiness Indicators;Mozambique;Mozambique, the only Lusophone country covered in the agribusiness indicators initiative, has had a turbulent history since independence. Civil unrest over some 20 years and frequent drought in southern Mozambique, coupled with floods near the many waterways that transect the country (mainly east-west), have inhibited an agricultural transformation. Even so, Mozambique could be a regional breadbasket. The country has much potentially usable arable land, along with access to river water for irrigation in many agricultural production zones, particularly in central and northern Mozambique. Sesame, pigeon peas, and cashew exports are significant and rising, not to mention exports of industrial crops such as cotton, leaf tobacco, and sugarcane, yet production of grain and most other food crops remains stagnant.

handle:10986/26639;Land Change Dynamics;Insights from Intensity Analysis Applied to an African Emerging City;Land change in Kigali, Rwanda, is examined using Intensity Analysis, which measures the temporal stationarity of changes among categories. Maps for 1981, 2002 and 2014 were produced that show the land categories Built, Vegetated and Other, which is composed mainly of croplands and bare surfaces. Land change accelerated from the first time interval (1981–2002) to the second time interval (2002–2014), as increased human and economic activities drove land transformation. During the first interval, Vegetated showed net loss whereas Built showed net gain, in spite of a small transition directly from Vegetated to Built. During the second interval, Vegetated showed net gain whereas Built showed nearly equal amounts of gross loss and gross gain. The gain of Built targeted Other during both time intervals. A substantial portion of overall change during both time intervals consisted of simultaneous transitions from Vegetated to Other in some locations and from Other to Vegetated in other locations.;"Akinyemi, Felicia O.

With decisive fiscal and monetary policies, the government managed to restore confidence in Kenya's medium term prospects. Kenya's growth rate is still below its potential and its peers, external imbalances remain which threaten its future growth, and the pace of economic growth is not generating enough modern sector wage jobs. With the passage of the new constitution in 2010 and its implementation, stronger institutions are emerging, putting Kenya on a sound footing ready to take off. In the very short term, what remains to be done is for Kenya to deliver a credible and peaceful election in March 2013, and thereafter a smooth transfer of power. In the medium term, Kenya will need to start building a stronger foundation for growth, and undertake structural reforms to correct the external imbalances. To generate more jobs for the burgeoning educated youth population, Kenya will also need to reduce the transaction cost for firms, by reducing job-smothering corruption and the cost of doing business (particularly in transport and energy).;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"land reform;poverty";;;"002;KEN";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26660;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26660/1/636570NWP0keny00Box379863B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26660/636570NWP0keny00Box379863B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26676;Promoting Green Urban Development in African Cities;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania Urban Environmental Profile;The city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania has undergone a period of unprecedented urbanization that has contributed to the degradation of the city’s natural environment. With a growth rate above or near 5% for the past three decades, it is the fastest growing city in East Africa. The arrival of thousands of in-migrants year after year has overwhelmed the city’s ability to deliver adequate public services, housing and jobs. Unplanned, densely populated informal settlements that lack basic water, sewer, and waste services now cover much of the city’s land area. At the same time, climate change is placing further strains on the city’s ability to manage the urban environment. The projected rise in temperature, coupled with an increase in precipitation, could have wide-ranging impacts. A projected increase in the intensity of rainfall will result in storm runoff that exceeds the capacity of the city’s infrastructure, causing flooding and the spread of pollution, of particular concern for low-lying informal settlements. Such conditions have degraded the quality of the city’s natural environment and the vital ecosystem services that they provide. the study of urban environmental issues with the advancement of more sustainable urban growth. The Urban Environmental Profile for Dar es Salaam has been prepared as the first component of the assignment “Promoting Green Urban Development in Africa: Enhancing the Relationship Between Urbanization, Environmental Assets and Ecosystem Services,” a project being conducted under the leadership of the World Bank.

handle:10986/26682;Moldova;World Bank Country-Level Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption;Moldova has suffered over the last two decades from rising poverty, territorial secession, armed conflict, and the spillover effects of a regional financial crisis, with declining population size and life expectancy, and an economy approximately one-half of what it was in 1990. The return of the Moldovan Communist Party (PCRM), which won two major elections after 2001, contributed to increasing centralization of governmental authority along with a reform agenda that emphasized greater state control over the economy, fiscal support to state enterprises and collective farms, land consolidation, economic protectionism, and the tolerance of monopolies in industry and energy. At the same time, the government has increased social expenditures, and taken major steps to improve public financial management. Bank engagement was moderately effective at the country and project levels, and substantially effective at the sector level. There was progress in several aspects of public financial management (PFM). Regulatory streamlining has reduced costs to business, although resistance to civil service reform has left much work to be done. The Bank has also helped achieve progress on Governance and Anticorruption (GAC) issues in primary education, roads, and private sector development. Education progress is highly uneven across regions, for example, overweight trucks continue to tear up roads, and private investment is not enough to make a dent in high unemployment. A graduated approach to country systems and road sector technical audits help address GAC issues at the project level. The overall impact of GAC strategy implementation was moderate. The GAC committees set up at the regional and sectoral Bank department levels are particularly useful mechanisms for disseminating practices from the GAC Council. Staff has been proactive in using Country Governance and Anticorruption (CGAC) resources. However, three applications for window one funding were not approved, reducing the ability of this small program to seize opportunities.;"Wescott, Clay

In 2010, Southeast Sulawesi's economy grew at 8.2percent the third fastest in Indonesia. The poverty rate has declined significantly in the past 10 years and the unemployment rate is one the lowest in Indonesia. Per capita expenditure in Southeast Sulawesi has increased nine-fold compared to pre decentralization rates Southeast Sulawesi's consolidated per capita expenditure now falls in the top 10 in Indonesia. However, Southeast Sulawesi is still facing a range of challenges. The Human Development Index (HDI) has continued to lag at 25th in Indonesia over the past five years. Although regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown rapidly, in real per capita terms it is still far below the national provincial average. Southeast Sulawesi' poverty rate also remains above the national average. It will be important for the high and growing rate of per capita expenditure to be matched with improvements in public financial management capacity within the local government. In the context of overcoming these challenges and capitalizing on expanding opportunities, the local governments in Southeast Sulawesi and in particular the provincial government need to work harder to make the most of its budgetary resources. The development agenda and programs must be sharpened and budget allocations must be optimized to achieve development targets, especially in the strategic sectors of education, health, infrastructure and agriculture. This report contains findings and recommendations intended to support sub national governments in Southeast Sulawesi province to enhance their public financial management performance; improve the quality of evidence based planning and budgeting; and accelerate the achievement of existing development targets.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-10-31;en;"decentralization;rural areas;urban areas";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26701;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26701/1/732730WP0South00disclosed0100170120.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26701/732730WP0South00disclosed0100170120.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26714;Agglomeration and Manufacturing Activities in Indonesia;;The importance of the agglomeration process in facilitating growth and productivity increases in Indonesia's manufacturing sector cannot be ignored. The agglomeration process is associated with improved productivity as firms enjoy external benefits from either urbanization or from the sharing of inputs available in certain locations. Evidence suggests that Java remains the main corridor for manufacturing activities, with large cities attracting manufacturers that are looking for externalities from urbanization. However, there are signs that some firms are shifting to new locations in other cities and forming new agglomerations in areas that these firms find more favorable. With regional autonomy, issues relating to local governance, infrastructure, and uncertainties in local regulations are increasingly important and can undermine the process of agglomeration. Some programs promoting certain locations as special economic zones (SEZs) are experiencing difficulties in attracting manufacturing investors. Understanding these challenges should help policymakers to strengthen the underlying factors that facilitate manufacturing agglomeration.;"Rahardja, Sjamsu

handle:10986/26736;Collecting the Dirt on Soils;Advancements in Plot-Level Soil Testing and Implications for Agricultural Statistics;Much of the current analysis on agricultural productivity is hampered by the lack of consistent, high quality data on soil health and how it is changing under past and current management. Historically, plot-level statistics derived from household surveys have relied on subjective farmer assessments of soil quality or, more recently, publicly available geospatial data. The Living Standards Measurement Study of the World Bank implemented a methodological study in Ethiopia, which resulted in an unprecedented data set encompassing a series of subjective indicators of soil quality as well as spectral soil analysis results on plot-specific soil samples for 1,677 households. The goals of the study, which was completed in partnership with the World Agroforestry Centre and the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, were twofold: (1) evaluate the feasibility of integrating a soil survey into household socioeconomic data collection operations, and (2) evaluate local knowledge of farmers in assessing their soil quality. Although a costlier method than subjective assessment, the integration of spectral soil analysis in household surveys has potential for scale-up. In this study, the first large scale study of its kind, enumerators spent approximately 40 minutes per plot collecting soil samples, not a particularly prohibitive figure given the proper timeline and budget. The correlation between subjective indicators of soil quality and key soil properties, such as organic carbon, is weak at best. Evidence suggests that farmers are better able to distinguish between soil qualities in areas with greater variation in soil properties. Descriptive analysis shows that geospatial data, while positively correlated with laboratory results and offering significant improvements over subject assessment, fail to capture the level of variation observed on the ground. The results of this study give promise that soil spectroscopy could be introduced into household panel surveys in smallholder agricultural contexts, such as Ethiopia, as a rapid and cost-effective soil analysis technique with valuable outcomes. Reductions in uncertainties in assessing soil quality and, hence, improvements in smallholder agricultural statistics, enable better decision-making.;"Carletto, Calogero

handle:10986/26742;Philippine Economic Update, December 2012;Accelerating Reforms to Sustain Growth;The Philippine economy has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in East Asia, with growth accelerating to 7.1 percent in the third quarter. The acceleration of domestic demand since the first quarter of 2012 reflects the country's strong macroeconomic fundamentals, stronger government finances, and high confidence in the Aquino government's commitment to reform. Sound macroeconomic fundamentals, as seen in low inflation, and large current account surpluses and foreign exchange reserves, have continued to shield the economy from external headwinds, while a more diversified export basket allowed total exports to grow, despite the decline in electronics exports. Overall, the economy is expected to expand by over six percent this year, up from 3.9 percent last year. However, more structural reforms are needed to create more and better jobs, as the overall labor market outcome has been less responsive to the higher economic growth. The economy needs to shift from consumption towards investment, both public and private. The special focus sections of this update demonstrate that the implementation of such reforms can have high payoffs in terms of jobs and inclusive growth. Finally, by scaling-up and broadening several open government/open data initiatives in the country, the strengthening of inclusive institutions would be greatly enhanced, in line with the core principles of this government.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"agriculture;land reform;natural disasters;property rights";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;PHL";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26742;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26742/1/750210WP0P13270l0version00102902013.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26742/750210WP0P13270l0version00102902013.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26743;Urban Mass Transport Infrastructure in Medium and Large Cities in Developing Countries;;Developed at the request of the Mexican G20 Presidency for consideration by the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors at the G20 Leaders' Summit in Mexico, and jointly prepared with the Asian Development Bank, this policy paper positioned green transport in the context of cities development. Urban transport determines the shape of a city and its ecological footprint. Many cities in low and middle income countries are at a crossroads. Policy decisions taken now, while car use is still relatively low and cities retain a relatively transit friendly, compact urban form, will affect how people will live in their cities for many decades into the future. A new paradigm of urban transport can be part of the solution to reversing the deteriorating situation in some cities of developing countries, and supporting others to embark on a sustainable, low carbon, green growth path: developing a city for people rather than cars, and including public and mass transport as a major component of the modal structure. Implementing such a new paradigm can be truly transformational. This joint World Bank and Asian Development Bank paper lays out six aspects, which are most difficult to align, yet, are critical to ensure the sustainability of urban transport systems, visionary leadership, integrated strategy for land use and urban transport, coordination among agencies, domestic capacity, adequate cost recovery, and private participation in the operation and construction of urban transport systems. The paper proposes a set of new initiatives for G20 leaders' consideration, including the development of an umbrella toolkit to guide policy makers in charge of urban planning to make transport decisions best suited to their local contexts.;;"World Bank Group;Asian Development Bank";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"climate change;land use";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26743;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26743/1/705050WP00PUBL0eveloping0Countries0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26743/705050WP00PUBL0eveloping0Countries0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank and Asian Development Bank ;
handle:10986/26744;Taking Stock, June 2012;An Update on Vietnam's Recent Economic Development;The authorities' determined implementation of stabilization measures over the past year has helped to avert a macroeconomic crisis. If the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in 2010-11 was rapid, the improvement in the situation in the past twelve months has been equally swift. Regaining macroeconomic stability has been costly, but not stabilizing the economy would have led to even bigger losses. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has decelerated from 6.8 percent in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011, and further to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2012 as higher prices has lowered domestic demand, affecting sectors such as construction, manufacturing and utilities. Industrial production has slowed, inventory for key industrial products has accumulated, and a number of small and medium enterprises have either closed, been liquidated or temporarily suspended their operations. While the stabilization efforts may have contributed to a cyclical slowdown, Vietnam's trend growth rate has been on a downward path for the last 5-6 years, largely on account of the slow pace of structural reforms. Inefficiencies in state-owned enterprises, banks and public investments have been a drag on the country's long-term growth potential. With gains from macroeconomic stabilization still recent and fragile, especially in an external environment that is fraught with uncertainty, the government needs to be careful not to shift to an expansionary stance prematurely.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-06-30;en;"capacity building;land tenure;property rights;rural areas;rural development;rural population;sustainable development;urban areas;waste";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;VNM;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26744;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26744/1/695270WP0P12260lish0FINAL0MYCG02012.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26744/695270WP0P12260lish0FINAL0MYCG02012.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26748;Philippines Quarterly Update, March 2012;From Stability to Prosperity for All;The Philippine economy grew slower than expected at 3.7 percent in 2011, held back by weak public spending and external demand. In the fourth quarter (Q4), growth slightly improved at 3.7 percent. As in past quarters, growth was driven by remittance-fueled household consumption, which grew by 6.7 percent. The government's disbursement acceleration plan was partially successful and contributed 1.3 percentage points (ppt) to gross domestic product, or GDP growth in Q4, up from 0.3 ppt in Q3, but this was not enough to push growth up to the targeted level of around five percent. On the production side, the services sector, including the fast-growing business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, continued to drive growth. Industry, in particular exports manufacturing, was buffeted by weaker demand, while agriculture suffered from typhoon damages, highlighting the need to improve disaster and risk management. The country is benefiting from strong macroeconomic fundamentals, political stability, and a popular government that is seen by many as committed to improving governance and reducing poverty. Several reforms have successfully started, notably in public financial management. However, the window of opportunity is narrowing given elections in 2013 and 2016 and the historical difficulty of moving forward with reforms when the campaign period kicks in.

In contrast, fixed investment was more volatile, with private investment showing signs of picking up while public investments lagged. Malaysia's overall balance of payments recorded a larger surplus in the first half of the year reflecting a widening current account surplus and substantial net financial inflows.

handle:10986/26765;A Spatial Valuation of the Natural and Semi-Natural Open Space Areas in eThekwini Municipality;;Durban is located within a global biodiversity hotspot, and still contains a wealth of biodiversity. Some of this is protected in nature reserves, but much of it is in private hands or in communal lands on the city’s periphery. City managers are divided over the level of attention that should be given to preserving these remaining natural areas. While it is argued that they make a significant contribution to biodiversity conservation in the province, provide valuable ecosystem services and will contribute to the city’s resilience in the face of climate change, the counter argument is that much of this area should make way for development to alleviate the escalating problem of unemployment. The study of ecosystem services and their value to society has made significant advances since an estimate was made of Durban’s ecosystem services in the 1990s using early values from the international literature. The aim of this study was to provide estimates of the value of ecosystem services provided by natural open space areas within the eThekwini Municipal Area (EMA), and to map the geographic variation in these values as far as possible so as to be able to compare both areas and types of value, using available and locally-relevant data. This study was carried out as a desktop study based on available data. Modelling assumptions were based on data from within the study area, drawing on the regional, national or international literature only where necessary. The study focused on the direct values associated with the provision of natural resources, indirect use values associated with regulating services generated by ecosystem functioning, and the amenity values generated by ecosystem attributes.;"Turpie, Jane

Transformation through Infrastructure the updated World Bank Group Infrastructure Strategy FY12-15 - lays out the framework for transforming the Bank Group s engagement in infrastructure. It looks at the nexus between sectors and call for infrastructure to accelerate growth and even shift clients towards a more sustainable development trajectory. It also supports a new vision of who will finance infrastructure solutions. The new strategy rests on three pillars: 1) The Group will continue to do what it does well-sector based projects in support of the access and growth agenda. This will continue to represent the core of the group's engagement in infrastructure; 2) the group will support client demand for addressing the more complex, second-generation infrastructure issues. The capacity of the group to respond to these issues will require transforming how the group engages with clients and partners-by broadening the range of interlocutors interested in contributing to the solution, including middle-income countries, traditional and non-traditional donors, responsible businesses and local actors; brokering knowledge; using international for a to advance on certain global issues; collaborating more effectively with other multilateral development banks (MDBs) on issues and projects of regional or global relevance; helping align bilateral resources in order to access funding at scale; and delivering transformational projects; and 3) the Group will leverage its capital by bringing more private sector financing into infrastructure. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will ramp up its infrastructure business, with particular attention to third party resource mobilization, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will scale up its guarantee support and the Bank will reinforce its upstream work on the enabling environment in order to attract the private sector.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"climate change;slums;sustainable development;urban areas;urban population;urbanization;waste";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Access to Land & Tenure Security;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26768;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26768/1/678290WP0P12740ghinfrastructurefull.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26768/678290WP0P12740ghinfrastructurefull.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26772;Chinese FDI in Ethiopia;A World Bank Survey;"Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Africa is on the rise and Ethiopia is at the forefront of this trend. On request of the Government, the World Bank surveyed 69 Chinese enterprises doing business in Ethiopia with a 95-question survey in May/June 2012. The survey covered various aspects of the foreign direct investment climate in Ethiopia, including infrastructure, sales and supplies, land, crime, competition, finance, human resources, and questions about general opportunities and constraints for doing business in Ethiopia. This report summarizes the results of survey and provides policy suggestions in light of the analysis; the report also provides some broader background of the expected benefits of FDI into Ethiopia as well as current policies and approaches to promote incoming investment. Addressing identified obstacles could help Ethiopia to take better advantage of foreign investors in order to accelerate the shift from a predominantly low-productivity agriculture-based economy towards a higher-productivity manufacturing and export-based economy. Experiences in successful countries around the world, and especially East Asia show that foreign investment is instrumental to facilitate such a structural transformation and to maintain sustained and broad-based economic development. This study recommends five main areas for policy adjustments to facilitate foreign investors coming into Ethiopia: adjust customs clearance procedures and trade regulations; facilitate currency convertibility and increase transparency of the exchange rate policy; improve tax administration consistency and efficacy; execute impartial labor regulation; and increase the supply and quality of skilled workers.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-11-30;en;"corruption;expropriation;land ownership;property rights;sustainable development";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;ETH";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26772;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26772/1/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26772/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/26776;Acting Today for Tomorrow;A Policy and Practice Note for Climate- and Disaster-Resilient Development in the Pacific Islands Region, with Supporting Research, Analysis, and Case Studies;Pacific island countries continue to be among the most vulnerable in the world: they combine high exposure to frequent and damaging natural hazards with low capacity to manage the resulting risks. Their vulnerability is exacerbated by poorly planned socioeconomic development, which has increased exposure and disaster losses, and by climate change, which has increased the magnitude of cyclones, droughts, and flooding. Currently, inefficient management of risks negates development gains and incurs large costs for national and local governments. Progress in reducing vulnerability has been retarded in part because of fundamental problems with coordination and cooperation among relevant actors at all levels. 'acting today for tomorrow' provides case studies, data, and analysis from the Pacific region to make a case for climate-and disaster-resilient development as being the most appropriate way to address the above challenges. It outlines what the consequences are of not acting today to reduce risk, what important lessons have emerged from the last decade, and what must be done to move toward resilient development in Pacific island countries. The document is intended for an audience of practitioners and policymakers at all levels across all relevant sectors. Its analysis and recommendations are meant to inform disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) planning across a range of institutions. Over the last decade, some important lessons have emerged about what works, and what does not work, to reduce vulnerability. It is clear now that project-based DRR and CCA initiatives with relatively short time frames encourage fragmented efforts, inhibit carryover across initiatives, and ultimately do little to reduce underlying vulnerability in a lasting way. To achieve robust and effective political authority, leadership, and accountability for more resilient development, governments should anchor coordination of DRR and CCA in a high level central ministry/body both at national and regional levels and ensure that leaders are knowledgeable about disaster and climate risk management.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"climate change;deforestation;farmers;fisheries;food security;forestry;land management;land use;natural disasters;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26776;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26776/1/768450WP0P1267000WB0PPN0Tech0Report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26776/768450WP0P1267000WB0PPN0Tech0Report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26777;Revising the Land Law to Enable Sustainable Development in Vietnam;Summary of Priority Policy Recommendations Drawn form World Bank Studies;Vietnam's rapid and sustained economic growth and poverty reduction in the last two decades benefitted from the policy and legal reforms embodied in the Land Laws of 1987, 1993 and 2003 and subsequent related legal acts. This note outlines reforms related to four main themes. The first relates to the needed reform for agriculture land use to create opportunity to enhance effectiveness of land use as well as to secure farmers' rights in land use. Prolonging the duration of agricultural land tenure would give land users greater incentives to invest and care for the land. Raising the land holding ceiling and allowing greater land accumulation would facilitate greater economies of scale, and extending the rights of agricultural land users to alter the land use purpose will further improve efficiency. This scope for more flexible land use will become increasingly important in the context of climate change, with farmers needing to make a range of adjustments based upon expected weather patterns and the associated risks. The second set of priority reforms is to create transparent and equitable land acquisition and compensation by the State. Limiting the use of compulsory land acquisition only to cases for the public's benefit would similarly give land users more fairness and more confidence in their rights related to land. By relying predominantly on voluntary land conversions, there would also be a stronger sense of equity in those cases when land users actually do lose their land. Changing the focus of land compensation pricing (in cases of compulsory land acquisition), and introducing innovations such as benefit sharing, land pooling and land readjustment are also essential for generating a sense of fairness. Creating an efficient grievance redress mechanism at the investment project level would reduce complaints, speed up project implementation and facilitate social stability. A third set of priority reforms is that the land law should offer the opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen the land use rights of vulnerable groups, such as women, the poor and ethnic minority communities. Land management oversight can be made more efficient by amending the land management decentralization and building monitoring and evaluation systems. Expanding the coverage of Land Use Rights Certificates (LURCs) and ensuring the rights and benefits of the land users would further help improve efficiency and fairness. Finally, the fourth set of priority reforms is aimed at making the governance system more effective and accountable. Developing a more flexible and effective land planning management system, and improving transparency of land and anti-corruption in land management are all needed to take Vietnam's land governance system closer to that worthy of a middle income country.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-09-30;en;"agriculture;climate change;common property;decentralization;farmland;forest land;forestry;land administration;land allocation;land area;land degradation;land distribution;land law;land management;land markets;land ownership;land reform;land registration;land rights;land speculation;land tenure;land titling;land transfers;land use;land use planning;land valuation;natural resources management;sustainable development;sustainable land use;urban areas;urban planning;urbanization";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Urban Tenure;Land & Investments;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;VNM;009";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26777;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26777/1/707260WP0REPLA0aw0Final0Eng012Oct12.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26777/707260WP0REPLA0aw0Final0Eng012Oct12.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/26780;Sustainable Agricultural Productivity Growth and Bridging the Gap for Small-Family Farms;Interagency Report to the Mexican G20 Presidency;Global agriculture will face multiple challenges over the coming decades. It must produce more food to feed an increasingly affluent and growing world population that will demand a more diverse diet, contribute to overall development and poverty alleviation in many developing countries, confront increased competition for alternative uses of finite land and water resources, adapt to climate change, and contribute to preserving biodiversity and restoring fragile ecosystems. Climate change will bring higher average temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme events, multiplying the threats to sustainable food security. Addressing these challenges requires co-ordinated responses from the public and private sectors and civil society that will need to be adapted to the specific circumstances of different types of farmers in countries at all levels of development. The recommendations provided are broadly of two types: specific actions that can contribute in some way to improving productivity growth or sustainable resource use (whether building on existing initiatives or suggesting new activities) and more general proposals that may not be actionable as presented but that serve to highlight areas for priority attention. This report also invites G20 countries to engage in a medium, to long-term, analysis-based peer review of policies fostering sustainable productivity growth, which would identify specific constraints and opportunities, beginning with their own food and agriculture sectors. In addition to possible benefits to participating countries, a peer review process could contribute to the identification of best policies and best policy packages to achieve the widely held aim of sustainably improving productivity of the global food and agriculture system. While such an initiative is proposed to and for G20 countries, it could have much wider application to interested countries.;"International Food Policy Research Institute

handle:10986/26783;Lessons from the Dzud;Adaptation and Resilience in Mongolian Pastoral Social-Ecological Systems;Dzud is the Mongolian term for a winter weather disaster in which deep snow, severe cold, or other conditions render forage unavailable or inaccessible and lead to high livestock mortality. Dzud is a regular occurrence in Mongolia, and plays an important role in regulating livestock populations. However, dzud, especially when combined with other environmental or socio-economic stresses and changes, can have a significant impact on household well-being as well as local and national economies. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by conducting in-depth case studies of four communities responses to the 2009-2010 dzud to document both household-and community-level impacts and responses. The case studies use a mixed-methods approach employing qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques including interviews, focus groups, household questionnaires, photovoice and document review, and were carried out in two soums (districts) located in the forest-steppe zone of Arkhangai Aimag (province), Ikhtamir and Undur Ulaan, and two soums in the Gobi desert-steppe zone of Bayankhongor Aimag, Jinst and Bayantsagaan.

handle:10986/26789;Zimbabwe Public Investment Management Efficiency Review;;The Public Investment Management (PIM) efficiency review is intended to support the Government of Zimbabwe, and in particular the Ministry of Finance, in its efforts to strengthen the efficiency of the public investment system, with the goal of improving the creation, operation and maintenance of public sector capital assets that support service delivery and economic growth. The problems of public investment management are not merely financial but systemic. Budget execution deficit remains a major bottleneck. Due to large backlogs across sectors, capital budget allocation has prioritized completion and rehabilitation of on-going and stalled projects and programs. Currently, public investment projects are mainly financed by the national budget. Regulatory frameworks for public-private partnerships are in place, but sluggish recovery from the private sector has not made it a notable source of financing for capital projects. Foreign loans and grants, and humanitarian aid from donors are not channeled through the official budget. This report is intended to provide the basis for a follow-on discussion with government on possible options and approaches to addressing the identified problems, focusing on those which are the most critical to Zimbabwe's economic recovery and long term development. It is complementary to the action plan, also developed by the team for consideration by the Government of Zimbabwe, which suggests a list of reform actions over the immediate to medium-term to strengthen the regulatory framework and build capacity across central and implementing agencies. The objective of the policy note is to support the Government of Zimbabwe to strengthen the efficiency of PIM system, with an ultimate goal of contributing to improved governance, service delivery, and economic growth.

handle:10986/26792;Climate Change and Agriculture in South Asia;Alternative Trade Policy Options;"There is increasing evidence suggesting that climate change will negatively impact agricultural production in South Asia. Decreased domestic production may make South Asian countries more dependent on imports. The extent to which South Asia will need to increase its imports as a result of climate change will presumably depend on the degree to which the latter will affect domestic output. The effects of climate change on agriculture may well differ substantially for individual South Asian countries and indeed for regions within a given country which can be approximated by food production units. This calls for an analysis of climate change effects on trade flows under alternative trade policy regimes both for agriculture and non-agricultural sectors. The specific objectives of the paper include the following: analyze the extent to which agricultural production in South Asia and elsewhere in the world may be affected by different scenarios regarding climate change; analyze the extent to which changes in domestic production in South Asia resulting from climate change will lead to increased demand for imports by South Asian countries; analyze the effects of increased import demand in South Asia and changing exportable surpluses elsewhere on world market prices of major agricultural commodities consumed in South Asia; to the extent that South Asian governments allow transmission of changes in world market prices to domestic prices, analyze the potential welfare effects of changes in the latter; analyze if, and to what extent, worldwide trade liberalization and implementation of South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) will dampen the effects of climate change on domestic agricultural prices in South Asia. In this context, the report is organized as follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two describes the methodology used - with particular attention to how different models and modeling techniques are linked to produce an as accurate as possible assessment based on state-of-the-art knowledge. Chapter three provides an up-to-date analysis of trade flows and policies, and production patterns for key food products in South Asia to explain the context in which climate change is taking place. Chapter four describes the climate change scenarios and illustrates their consequences for crop yields at a global level and for South Asia - and in particular shows the vulnerability of the region to these changes. Baseline design, simulations, and results are discussed in chapter five. The final chapter six provides a short summary, discusses the limitations of the analysis, and derives suggestions and guidelines for future research.";"Laborde, David

Individuals do not make employment decisions without taking into account options of housing market. Economy constantly changes and diverse opportunities arise in different locations at different points of time. Badly functioning housing market can cause low labor mobility and restrain the ability of employers to match vacancies in specific locations. The issue of labor mobility is especially vital for developing countries. Synovate, a global marketing research company, conducted survey of labor mobility in Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Serbia (Synovate, 2010). Results of the survey showed extremely low desire to relocate in Russia and Ukraine. If offered 1.5 times increase in salary, around 80 percent of respondents in Russia and Ukraine would still refuse to relocate, though in Bulgaria and Serbia only 50 percent of respondents would not change their location on this conditions. Moreover, imperfections in housing market were mentioned in this survey as one of the main reasons for low mobility in Russia and Ukraine.

handle:10986/26807;The Drivers of Reporter Reintegration in Northern Uganda;;The World Bank commissioned this report as part of a set of studies concerned with the Uganda Demobilization and Reintegration Program and the Amnesty Commission. The study represents one element of the set of studies which included the Final Independent Evaluation of the Uganda Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (UgDRP), Reporter Reintegration Survey and Community Dynamics Survey, and a study on the relationship between the Amnesty Commission and its DDR Implementing Partners study. The background field work and research for this study was integrated into the overall background research and fieldwork for the set of studies. In this study the focus of the analysis is on processes of reintegration rather than the achievement of a static marker of reintegration. In other words rather than examining the experience of reporters to identify the ones who are reintegrated and the ones who are not, the study examines the complex interplay of elements in the process of social and economic reintegration to identify which drivers have most influenced (positively and negatively) the reintegration process in which reporters are and have been engaged. The study identifies the drivers of successful or unsuccessful reintegration and the crosscutting dynamics such as gender, tradition, poverty and economic markets that exacerbate the impact of drivers of reintegration on the lives of reporters and communities. The report presents actionable findings that can inform future programming in the area. The overall purpose of the study is to provide an analysis of the drivers of reintegration and to identify the distinguishing features of successful reintegration amongst reporters.;Finn, Anthony;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"displacement;food security;land ownership;land tenure";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;UGA";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26807;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26807/1/675950WP00PUBL0ivers0reintegration0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26807/675950WP00PUBL0ivers0reintegration0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/26813;Identifying Investment Opportunities for Ruminant Livestock Feeding in Developing Countries;;In the future scenario for livestock development, there is a continuing role for smallholder producers, particular for dairy and small ruminants, relying heavily on grass and crop-residues, however in a growth mode, intensifying production, and enhancing the efficiency of resource use (less land, labor and feed resources per unit product). In particular improving the efficiency of converting feed into milk and meat will be critical to increase their income. Ensuring that happens will require technical solutions, in ensuring that feed rations are adequately balanced with the appropriate feedstuffs of adequate quality, and institutional solutions on how to provide smallholders access to high quality information and reliable supplies of sufficient quality feeds. Investment strategies will need to be purposefully tailored to fit these specific contexts. This study assesses where the demand for feed is likely to change the most, and where investments in feed are most likely to increase animal productivity and improve the livelihoods of those who raise livestock. The study focuses on smallholder ruminant-based livestock systems because they have potentially major transformative effects on the livelihoods of producers and others engaged in the related value chains. While pig and poultry enterprises typically play an important role in livelihoods at very low input levels, such as backyard scavenging poultry, they tend to be replaced very quickly by larger scale commercial units. In India for instance, broiler production moved from a few hundred birds per unit to units with a weekly turnover of ten to twenty thousand between 2001 and 2006.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-11-30;en;"agriculture;contract farming;farmers;farming systems;farmland;food security;grazing;rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"018;002;014;034;011";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26813;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26813/1/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26813/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26815;Mongolia Financial Sector Assessment;Housing Finance;"As the Mongolian mortgage market grows rapidly, and the Government of Mongolia (GoM) pursues an ambitious social housing agenda, there is an urgent need for a holistic sector approach. The following three key areas require attention from policymakers: first, there is a need to better balance housing supply and demand, which requires the authorities to focus on prudent mortgage lending standards and supervision, as well as on provision of housing infrastructure and zoned land. Second, it will be important to ensure effective implementation of ongoing and planned public housing finance programs, with a focus on preventing mortgage market distortions in pricing, emphasizing robust planning and rigorous transparency and governance. Third, authorities should aim for better balance in the composition of mortgage funding, with a focus on improvement in the legal and regulatory framework for capital markets, as well as Mongolian Mortgage Corporation (MIK) governance, products and operations. The Mongolian mortgage market is exhibiting strong growth, with portfolio outstanding increasing by 190 percent to Mongolian Tughrik (MNT) 656 billion (US$482 million) between 2009 and end-2011. This represents 8 percent of 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) and 12 percent of the 2011 banking loan book. The sector is highly concentrated, with top 4 lenders accounting for 89 percent of the market, as well as spatially in and around Ulaanbaatar. Housing prices have risen sharply in the last two years, particularly in 2011, when the increase for the predominantly mortgaged market segment was over 36 percent. While mortgage lending growth rates are consistent with the overall growth of household credit, real estate prices significantly outpaced Consumer Price Index (CPI) and GDP growth in 2011. Currently non-performing loans (NPL) are very low due to the unseasoned mortgage portfolio; however, high debt-to-income (DTI) ratio levels may exacerbate future loan age-related and cyclical delinquency increases. Due in part to extreme climatic constraints, shortage of zoned and serviced land, and infrastructure bottlenecks, housing supply is severely constrained. Large-scale, publicly-funded, subsidized housing initiatives, such as the '100,000 Apartments' Program, need to be carefully planned, so that they cause minimal distortion to the broader housing finance market.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-06-30;en;property rights;;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;MNG";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26815;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26815/1/731560WP0P12990C0disclosed010050120.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26815/731560WP0P12990C0disclosed010050120.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26825;Assessing Safety Net Readiness in Response to Food Price Volatility;;In 2008, when food prices rose precipitously to record highs, international attention and local policy in many countries focused on safety nets as part of the response. Now that food prices are high again, the issue of appropriate responses is again on the policy agenda. This note sets out a framework for making quick, qualitative assessments of how well countries' safety nets prepare them for a rapid policy response to rising food prices should the situation warrant. The framework is applied using data from spring 2011, presenting a snap?shot analysis of what is a dynamically changing situation. Based on this data safety net readiness is assessed in 13 vulnerable countries based on the following criteria: the presence of safety net programs, program coverage, administrative capacity, and to a lesser degree, targeting effectiveness. It is argued that these criteria will remain the same throughout time, even if the sample countries affected will be expected to vary. Based on this analysis the note highlights that though a number of countries are more prepared than they were in 2008, there is still a significant medium term agenda on safety net preparedness in the face of crisis. In this context, strategic lessons from the 2008 food crisis response are presented to better understand the response options and challenges facing governments and policy makers. The note concludes by calling for continued investment and scale up of safety nets to mitigate poverty impacts and help prevent long term setbacks in nutrition and poverty.;"Grosh, Margaret

This study set out to assess the relative health impacts of different wastewater management strategies on health in the Nile delta region using an approach similar to that used in the Ghana. The ultimate objective was to develop a framework for long-term investment planning based on monitoring of health and productivity impacts of proposed Bank operations which could be included in project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems. This will equip task teams to assess the risks and opportunities which arise due to the proposed shift from on-site to networked sanitation in four governorates where the Bank has wastewater operations. A secondary objective was to assess the extent to which existing legislation supports health riskbased planning.

Although the term “blue economy” has been used in different ways, it is understood here as comprising the range of economic sectors and related policies that together determine whether the use of oceanic resources is sustainable. An important challenge of the blue economy is thus to understand and better manage the many aspects of oceanic sustainability, ranging from sustainable fisheries to ecosystem health to pollution. A second significant issue is the realization that the sustainable management of ocean resources requires collaboration across nation-states and across the public-private sectors, and on a scale that has not been previously achieved. This realization underscores the challenge facing the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as they turn to better managing their blue economies.";;"World Bank Group;United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-06-30;en;"fisheries;aquaculture;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"009;029";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26843;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26843/1/115545.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26843/115545.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26846;Is Consanguinity an Impediment to Improving Human Development Outcomes?;;This paper uses unique data collected in rural Pakistan to assess the extent to which consanguinity, which is widespread in North Africa, Central and West Asia, and most parts of South Asia, is linked to child cognitive ability and nutritional status. As economic benefits of marrying cousins may lead to upward bias in estimates of the effects of consanguinity on child outcomes, prior work likely underestimates the negative impacts of consanguinity on child outcomes. This paper finds that children born into consanguineous marriages have lower test scores, lower height-for-age, and a higher likelihood of being severely stunted. After controlling for current household wealth and parent education, the effects of endogenous consanguinity on child cognitive ability and height-for-age are identified by (current and past) grandfather land ownership and maternal grandparent mortality as instruments for consanguineous marriage of parents.;"Mete, Cem

handle:10986/26851;Tax Reform in Vietnam;Toward a More Efficient and Equitable System;In 2010, after two decades of rapid economic growth, Vietnam passed the threshold to become a lower-middle-income economy. Sustained market-oriented reforms combined with intensive efforts to integrate into the world economy are among the key drivers of this achievement. The reform of tax policy and administration has been a vital part of this transition. This is leading to a fundamental change in the composition of taxpayers, from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and foreign-invested companies to a myriad of small and medium private enterprises. Economic transition is also leading to an equally important change in the sources of government revenue, away from cross-border trade-related taxes and revenue collection from crude oil toward a greater share of domestic tax revenue, in particular taxation of business profits, labor income, and capital gains on land. However, completing the transition to a market economy will require changes going beyond tax collection and administration procedures, and will involve changes to the tax instruments themselves. At the end of this process, Vietnam should have a set of taxes that is simple and transparent, secures a stable flow of revenues for the government, encourages an efficient allocation of resources, and does not risk constituting a source of inequality or unfairness. The purpose of the series of studies in this volume is to shed light on the issues Vietnam will be facing in the process of reforming its tax policy and administration. The studies are also expected to lead to concrete policy recommendations contributing to the preparation of key policies and legislative documents to ensure the achievement of the state budget revenue target and other tax administration reform targets in the SEDP 2011-2015. It is expected that the individual studies in this series will become useful inputs into the debate surrounding the issuance of new laws and regulations. It is also hoped that the volume will support the reform momentum in the tax policy area, leading to increased efficiency, transparency, and equity.;"Shukla, Gangadha Prasad

handle:10986/26854;South Africa Economic Update, November 2011;Focus on Green Growth;The global financial roller coaster, with the Euro zone as its lead car, has hit economic prospects across the globe. The South African economy, with its close links to the world economy, has suffered, too, resulting in weakened growth prospects, lower fiscal revenues, lower and more volatile valuation of the rand, and dampened external financing. This further compounds the policy challenges facing the authorities, on top of their preoccupation with unyielding unemployment, which requires higher and more inclusive economic growth. Policymaking is also conditioned by a growing recognition that future growth needs to be less carbon-intensive. As elsewhere, opportunities in green economies are viewed with keen interest, as a way of simultaneously targeting a cleaner environment and stimulating innovation, growth, and job creation. While green policies can have large synergies and co-benefits with the growth and employment agenda, they are not a substitute for it. Indeed, such synergies are likely to be mutually enhancing and larger when the growth and environment objectives are being pursued by multiple, well-targeted and coordinated policies.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-11-30;en;"agriculture;climate change;deforestation;fisheries;land use;property rights;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"018;002;ZAF";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26854;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26854/1/708590WP00PUBL0ber020110Full0Report.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26854/708590WP00PUBL0ber020110Full0Report.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26862;Thai Flood 2011;Rapid Assessment for Resilient Recovery and Reconstruction Planning;This report outlines these findings, including damage and loss estimates and social and economic impacts, and proposes strategies for resilient recovery and reconstruction planning. Heavy rain combined with multiple tropical storms throughout the extended rainy season played a large part in the extensive flooding. Flash floods were reported in several areas in the north in May, and tropical depression Haima arrived in June followed by Nock-Ten in July, the combination of which caused widespread flooding. Overall, the floods affected more than 13 million people and resulted in more than 680 deaths. The floods impacted heavily on the private sector, particularly manufacturing. Manufacturing makes up about 38.5 percent of Thailand's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is one of the main drivers of Thailand's exports. The majority of manufacturers are located in five flood-affected provinces, namely Bangkok, Ayuthaya, Nakhon Sawan, Pathum Thani, and Samut Sakhon. Tourism, housing and the financial sector were also heavily affected. Though there was some damage to tourism infrastructure, the greatest impact came from losses in revenue from accommodation, transportation, shopping, food and beverages, entertainment and sightseeing.

handle:10986/26871;Investing in Trees and Landscape Restoration in Africa;What, Where, and How;"Reforestation measures for degraded lands, strategies for the sustainable management of forest resources, and agroforestry practices that incorporate trees into farming systems are increasingly demonstrating their promise for producing commercialized tree products. Although the level of investment so far has remained modest, the challenge is to find ways to scale up promising investments in a way that will have a clear impact at the landscape level. These types of investments can help achieve the triple wins of climate-smart agriculture: increased incomes and yields, climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation.Market trends are promising for a wide range of tree-based technologies, including tropical fruits, cashews, honey, timber and wood products, lipids, gums and resins, tree crops, and agroforestry systems. In many cases, African entrepreneurs, farmers, civil society, and governments have responded dynamically to the widespread challenge of land degradation. The continent is dotted with landscapes where production of trees on farms and in managed forests has grown dramatically to meet market and subsistence needs; sustainable agricultural practices and revegetation have restored soils and watersheds; and key conservation areas are being protected. However, this is not happening at the scale required by societal needs in Africa. In part, this is due to a lack of strategic cooperation and coordination between private sector investors and land managers (who are focused on realizing profitable opportunities and meeting their own needs) and public and civil society actors (who are focused on restoring forest cover and ecosystem services). Such coordination is only possible when the biophysical potential for landscape restoration, private sector investment opportunity and incentives, and societal demand for multiple benefits converge. Much can be learned from examples of large-scale landscape restoration in Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Tanzania, and Zambia, and the variable roles of the private sector, farmers, government, and civil society in supporting and undertaking investment.";"Dewees, Peter

All these priority concerns are integral components of poverty reduction programs in the Philippines. The Philippines has made significant progress in empowering women and in advancing gender equality. Since the government introduced a constitution in 1987 affirming the equality of women, it has pursued a number of initiatives to mainstream gender concerns in national policies and programs. A development plan for women was launched in 1987, followed by a plan for gender-responsive development, 1995-2025, coordinated by the National Commission on the Role of Filipino women. In 2004, the commission drafted a framework plan for women that identify three priority concerns to meet the objectives of gender equality and women's empowerment: economic empowerment of women, protection and fulfillment of women's human rights, and gender-responsive governance. Projects that support these priorities will facilitate more equitable development across the Philippines, including supporting the full participation of women in political processes and governance in the international and national local level, strengthening gender-sensitive and inclusive programs and mechanisms with civil society, and increasing women's access to economic resources such as capital, technology, information, markets, and training.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-11-30;en;"agrarian reform;capacity building;indigenous peoples;land ownership;land tenure;local community;occupation;sustainable development";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;009;PHL";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26872;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26872/1/660340WP00PUBL0aking0everyone0count.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26872/660340WP00PUBL0aking0everyone0count.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/26882;The Role of Agriculture in a Modernizing Society;Food, Farms and Fields in China 2030;China's success in addressing food problems after adopting the reforms in 1978 has been nothing less than remarkable. Grain output (rice, wheat and maize) has almost doubled and most hunger has been eliminated. Ever since China embarked on its reform agenda more than 30 years ago, its economic growth and poverty reduction have been nothing less than remarkable. Agriculture has been an important contributor to these developments. Since 1978, China has almost doubled its cereal production (rice, wheat and maize) and it is now feeding 1.3 billion people, or 20 percent of the world's population, while having less than 11 percent of the world s agricultural land and less than 6 percent of its water. New challenges are presenting themselves for China's agriculture, and old ones are resurfacing. High (land saving) Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth and increasingly open domestic and international markets, combined with grain self-sufficiency targets, a multitude of very small, fragmented production structures, and distorted land and labor markets have defined Chinese agriculture over the past three decades. The relative importance of agriculture s three problems in policymaking thus evolves during the course of development away from the food to the farm and field problems. This shift has however recently been compounded by a resurgence of the food problem, as global supplies struggle to keep up with demand. China's agriculture anno 2030 will be predominantly a modern commercial smallholder agriculture that ensures self-sufficiency in cereal food (rice and wheat), but not in cereal feed (maize and soybeans). The sector will maximize rural employment opportunities in labor intensive high value agricultural products and act as a diligent custodian of its precious natural resources.;Christiaensen, Luc;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-05-31;en;"agriculture;animal husbandry;aquaculture;climate change;farmers;farmland;food security;forestry;land distribution;land management;rural development;sustainable development;urbanization";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;CHN";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26882;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26882/1/773670WP0EASER00Box377296B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26882/773670WP0EASER00Box377296B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

There are three reports explained in this study as: 1) the policy note on improving land acquisition and voluntary land conversion in Vietnam; the study on land valuation mechanisms for compensation, support and resettlement in Vietnam; and the study on improving the system for resolving complaints on compensation, support and resettlement in Vietnam. The objective of the study was to assess the issues relating to involuntary and voluntary land conversion in the current laws and policies, and the implementation of these laws, and to propose improvements to be considered in the preparation of the law on amendments and supplementations of the Land Law scheduled to be placed before the National Assembly in 2013.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"land valuation;land administration";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;VNM;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26886;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26886/1/648910WP0Land000Box361546B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26886/648910WP0Land000Box361546B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26890;The Cost of Adapting to Extreme Weather Events in a Changing Climate;;Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world. Situated in the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna (GBM) rivers, the country is exposed to a range of river and rainwater flood hazards due to climate variability, the timing, location, and extent of which depend on precipitation in the entire GBM basin. The Government of Bangladesh is fully committed to global climate-change advocacy and action, having already invested heavily in adaptation measures and policies. In recent decades, the government has invested more than US$10 billion to protect its population and assets in the floodplains. Given the uncertain magnitude and timing of the added risks from climate change, it is essential to identify the costs of climate proofing Bangladesh's critical infrastructure from intensified monsoon floods and cyclonic storm surges. Previously, few if any detailed studies have been developed on the costs of climate-proofing the country's infrastructure assets from inland monsoon floods and cyclones. Most analytical work to date has been confined to case studies, with relatively limited sets of locations, impacts, and adaptation measures. This study aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing detailed vulnerable population estimates and estimates of the incremental costs of asset adaptation out to the year 2050. It is part of a larger World Bank-supported study, entitled Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change (EACC), funded by the governments of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"climate change;farmers;food security;natural disasters";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";;"BGD;034";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26890;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26890/1/678450NWP0Box3000BDS28ClimateChange.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26890/678450NWP0Box3000BDS28ClimateChange.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/26896;Adapting to Climate Variability;Learning from Past Experience and the Role of Institutions;Adaptation to human-induced climate change is currently receiving a lot of attention in international development circles. But throughout human existence, natural resource-dependent people have exploited and coped with the effects of climate variability on the ecosystems from which they derive a living. Learning from this experience can help inform the design of appropriate policies for responding to human-induced climate change. This paper presents the results of a World Bank study which sought to better understand the role of local institutions in supporting adaptation to climate variability and change in Ethiopia, Mali and Yemen. The study raised three questions. First, what strategies have been adopted by rural households in the past to adapt to climate variability? Second, to what extent do institutions of various sorts assist households in adopting adaptation strategies? And third, what are the factors that prevent households from adopting appropriate adaptation strategies? For the purposes of this paper, institutions are defined as structured, formal or informal organizations. The study followed a three-step approach. First, drawing on original data from field surveys, focus group discussions and institutional stakeholder interviews, household vulnerability to climate variability was characterized in terms of its three constituent elements: exposure to climate-related shocks and stresses, and sensitivity and adaptive capacity in the face of such stressors. Sensitivity refers to the degree to which people are affected by climate variability and change. High levels of exposure and sensitivity and low levels of adaptive capacity generally result in high levels of vulnerability. But a high level of exposure need not necessarily result in a high level of vulnerability if the household's adaptive capacity is also high.;"Ruijs, Arjan

handle:10986/26897;Improving the Rural Investment Climate for Businesses;Key to Rural Income Generation;An appropriate rural investment climate (RIC) is essential for rural businesses to be successful and generate employment and income in their communities. Improving the investment climate could facilitate income-generation activities in both farm and nonfarm sectors, thus reducing rural poverty. Nonfarm sector focused growth, combined with agricultural growth, and has been shown by Delgado et al. (1998) to have a significant impact on the local economy through the generation of employment and income. This study is the first to focus on both farm and nonfarm enterprises in its 2010 surveys of RIC in Yemen, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Mozambique unlike six previous RIC assessment (RICA) pilot projects that focused only on nonfarm enterprises. This report assesses the weaknesses and strengths of all RIC components in farm and nonfarm enterprises of the four countries surveyed, and recommends measures to address the weaknesses. The report identifies similar business obstacles for farm and nonfarm enterprises and four critical areas of the RIC to be improved. The results of the RICA are based on analyses of obstacles perceived by rural entrepreneurs and on assessments by RIC indicators, enterprise entry and exit, and enterprise performance. To have maximum synergy effects, farm and nonfarm enterprises should be promoted together.;Sawada, Naotaka;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-02-28;en;"capacity building;corruption;farmers;land markets;land use;property rights;transaction costs;urban areas";Land & Investments;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";2;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26897;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/26897/1/678420NWP0Box30l0Investment0Climate.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26897/678420NWP0Box30l0Investment0Climate.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27069;India Economic Update, September 2012;;Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has slowed to a nine year low of 6.5 percent for FY2011-12, from 8.4 percent in the two previous years. The slowdown was most pronounced in the industrial sector, and more specifically in manufacturing and mining. In the quarter ending in June 2012, industrial output growth as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) has been negative. The contraction was particularly pronounced in the production of capital goods, which is in line with falling investment demand on the expenditure side of the National Accounts. The current account deficit reached a record 4.2 percent of GDP in FY2011-12, because of decelerating export growth and high crude prices. Merchandise exports grew by 41 percent in September 2011, but their growth slowed to 2 percent by August 2012 (measured as 12-months cumulative exports compared with the same 12 months of the previous year). Inflation reached 7.6 percent in August 2012. This represents a marked slowdown since September 2011, but there has been an uptick in food prices in recent months. Also, higher domestic prices for fuel, which are necessary to rein in spending on subsidies, will contribute to inflationary pressure. Inflation is therefore expected to reach 8 percent at end-March 2013. Real GDP growth is forecast to reach around 6.0 percent in FY2012-13, after 5.3 percent growth Q4 of FY2011-12 and 5.5 percent growth in Q1 of FY2012-13. The slowdown is at least partly caused by structural problems. These include power shortages, which are partly caused by the financial difficulties facing the electricity sector as discussed in the special topic section of this update, the corruption scandals that have hit the mining and telecom sectors, investor uncertainty because of pending changes in legislation (mining, taxes, land acquisition), and the tightening constraints of land and infrastructure. Tighter macroeconomic policies, slow growth in the core Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and worries about another global recession also weigh on growth. Important signals to revive domestic growth drivers to lift sentiment more than produce instant efficiency gains could come from reforms recently announced and, more importantly, the reform of direct taxes, the implementation of the long-delayed Goods and Services Tax (GST), and passage of the land acquisition and mining bills. This update also looks closely at two important topics for medium- and long-term growth, namely India's Right to Education (RTE) Act, which aims to shape elementary education, and the financial difficulties in the Indian power sector.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-09-30;en;agriculture;;;"IND;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27069;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27069/1/730930REVISION0pdata0September02012.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27069/730930REVISION0pdata0September02012.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27071;India Economic Update, March 2012;;In 2011, India's economic growth has slowed to below 7 percent and the stock markets mirrored the weakening economic conditions, but recovered somewhat in early 2012. Industrial sector output growth briefly slipped into negative territory. On the demand side, fixed investment and consumption growth slowed. India's exports were growing very strongly through 2011 despite the worsening economic conditions in Europe, which continued to be India's most important export market. The balance of payments continued to be in surplus during April-September 2011, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reserves declined by a small amount since then. The rupee nevertheless depreciated by 20 percent between August and December, before recovering somewhat in early 2012. Macroeconomic policies presented a mixed picture: the central government is likely to miss the ambitious target for fiscal consolidation it had set in the FY2011-12 budget by about one percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Slippages are due to lower-than-expected revenues and increasing outlays on subsidies, which had been given low budgetary allocations in anticipation of strong policy changes, which failed to materialize. In India, the slowdown in GDP growth witnessed over the last two quarters is likely to extend into the coming fiscal year because of the weakness in investment. In FY2011-12 and FY2012-13, GDP growth is forecast to reach around 7-7.5 percent, a significant slowdown from the 9-10 percent growth in the run-up to the global financial crisis. The slowdown is at least partly caused by structural problems (power projects facing delays due to the lack of coal and gas feedstock, mining and the telecom sectors hit by corruption scandals, unavailability of land and infrastructure).;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-03-31;en;agriculture;;;"IND;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27071;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27071/1/694030WP00PUBL0mic0Updata0March2012.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27071/694030WP00PUBL0mic0Updata0March2012.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27085;Thailand Economic Monitor, December 2012;;The Thai economy in 2012 rebounded from the severe floods but continues to be affected by the slowdown in the global economy. Real GDP in 2012 is projected to grow by 4.7 percent supported by the rebound in household consumption and greater investments by both the private and public sectors as part of flood rehabilitation and the government s consumption-stimulating measures. The economy is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2013 as manufacturing production fully recovers and the global economy sees a modest recovery. Exports in 2013 are therefore expected to grow by 5.5 percent compared to only 3.6 percent in 2012. Budget deficit will be 2.5 percent of GDP for FY2013 plus additional off-budget spending for water resource management projects in FY2013. Public debt is estimated to be close to 50 percent of GDP in 2013. The paddy pledging scheme is estimated to cost around 3.5 percent of GDP each year, while the actual losses will be realized once the rice stocks are sold. The minimum wages have been raised by 40 percent nation-wide in 2012 and will be raised to a uniform rate of THB300 per day. Developing higher skills is imperative for higher incomes, living standards, and for Thailand to grow sustainably and inclusively. Thailand can do better in enabling the poor and vulnerable groups to participate in productive economic activities by pursuing a coordinated approach between universal and targeted social policy.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"farmers;land reform;natural disasters";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"030;009;THA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27085;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27085/1/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27085/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The private sector plays an essential role in contributing to economic growth and prosperity. Companies contribute to socio-economic development by employing workers, improving the skills and knowledge base, buying from local suppliers and providing products and services that improve people's lives. They also contribute to government revenues through generating and paying taxes.

handle:10986/27093;How to Keep Momentum Up in Carbon Markets?;;This note examines how to maximize the benefits from the use of market instruments in support of developing countries' low-emission development priorities. First, it briefly surveys the current state and trends of the carbon market, highlighting the main achievements of carbon finance over its decade-long history. Second, it reviews updated scenarios of the scale of future carbon markets and associated financial flows, in light of developments in climate negotiations and domestic markets. Finally, it identifies the necessary steps to scale up carbon market flows in future, on both the demand and supply sides, including the reform of existing mechanisms, and innovation to broaden the scope, scale and reach of carbon markets. The most important determinant of carbon offset market flows to developing countries is clearly the level of international mitigation targets: the more ambitious the targets the greater the scope for such flows. Developed countries can also encourage flows by increasing supplementary limits, which are the proportion of mitigation targets that can be met by purchases from developing countries. Finally, there remains a considerable need for innovation, awareness-raising and capacity building in public and private institutions in developing countries, to increase their participation in the carbon market and build and enabling environment for low-emission development.;Ambrosi, Philippe;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-10-31;en;"capacity building;climate change;deforestation;forest conservation;forestry;land management;land use;sustainable development;transaction costs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27093;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27093/1/762440WP0How0t00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27093/762440WP0How0t00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27097;A Toolkit of Policy Options to Support Inclusive Green Growth;;In 2012, the Mexican Presidency of the G20 introduced inclusive green growth as a cross-cutting priority on the G20 development agenda. The second meeting of the G20 Development Working Group (DWG), hosted by the Government of the Republic of Korea, took place in Seoul the 19th and 20th of March 2012. As agreed during the first DWG meeting, this second meeting focused on the priorities for their presidency in the first half of 2012: infrastructure, food security and inclusive green growth (IGG). At its Seoul meeting, the DWG also agreed that IGG co-facilitators and relevant international organizations (IOs) should work together in 2012 to develop a nonprescriptive good practices guide/toolkit on enabling national policy frameworks for inclusive green growth to support countries who voluntarily wish to design and implement affordable and inclusive green growth policies, with the aim of achieving sustainable development and poverty alleviation. The toolkit is organized as follows. First, the necessity of applying the different tools in the context of a broad inclusive green growth strategy is stressed, and a harmonized framework combining approaches and tools identified by all four IOs is set forth. Second, the document offers an overview of key tools that can be mobilized to implement an inclusive green growth strategy. Quick technical descriptions of these tools are offered along with suggested sources for further details. Finally, capacity building and knowledge sharing initiatives are presented, with the Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP) highlighted as a powerful collaborative tool to advance policies for inclusive green economies.;;"African Development Bank;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);United Nations;World Bank Group";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"capacity building;climate change;corruption;fisheries;food security;forestry;land degradation;land use;property rights;sustainable development;urban areas;urbanization;youth";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27097;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27097/1/705010WP0Toolk00Box370043B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27097/705010WP0Toolk00Box370043B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27098;SMEs for Job Creation in the Arab World;SME Access to Financial Services;The Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has brought to the forefront key challenges: the need to create job opportunities, equal access, a level playing field, transparency and accountability, and a fair and competitive environment. Crony capitalism, the privileged access of certain elites to favorable legal and regulatory treatment, access to markets, and the coincidence of political and economic power, was a major concern contributing to the uprising. Many saw privilege and corruption as the source of unemployment and inequality, effectively raising barriers to entry and growth for the majority of entrepreneurs. At the same time, practices such as connected lending and preferential land allocations, contributed to poor performance of key institutions, underpinning the market economy. It is critical for the MENA countries to achieve the aspirations of their people and attain sustainable and inclusive development by expanding private-led employment and creating entrepreneurship opportunities. This report assesses the supply and demand of financial services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the MENA region, as well as the regulatory, institutional and policy environment that determines the cost, risk, and scale of SME finance. Emerging and promising SME finance models for banks, investors, government and regulators are outlined. These could significantly improve the outreach, viability, risk management, and development impacts of SME finance in the MENA region. SMEs need access to longer term credit products and equity, in addition to working capital loans and trade finance. They also need payment and card services, deposit facilities, liquidity management, risk management tools and insurance. The principal role of the state is as an enabler and regulator, providing the financial infrastructure, and legal and policy frameworks that financial institutions need to be able to meet the range of SME financial needs profitably. All this will contribute to attaining a more sustainable and inclusive system that can play a more important role in economic growth, and the regions prosperity.;"Nasr, Sahar

handle:10986/27108;BioCarbon Fund Experience;Insights from Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism Projects;Carbon finance recognizes the contribution of projects to mitigating climate change. To be able to access carbon finance, projects can certify their emission reductions under a variety of standards, one of which is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Project developers can sell their carbon credits either in the voluntary or the regulated market. Since 2002, projects from diverse sectors have been applying the CDM modalities and procedures to generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) that are traded in the carbon market Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) is one out of the 15 sectors that can generate carbon credits under the CDM. The purpose of this document is to share the experience of the BioCarbon Fund (BioCF) of the World Bank in developing and implementing 21 A/R CDM projects in 16 countries. This experience shows that the benefits associated with A/R CDM projects support the livelihood of rural people and their local environment in a significant manner. However, depending on their capacity, projects may struggle with getting credit certification and the associated benefits. This report presents the opportunities and challenges A/R CDM projects face and presents recommendations to facilitate their design and implementation as well as to scale them up significantly.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"climate change;desertification;forestry;land tenure;land use;rural areas;rural development;sustainable development;transaction costs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27108;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27108/1/765660WP0Bioca00Box374386B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27108/765660WP0Bioca00Box374386B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Indeed, as demonstrated in the report, many of these policies are closely linked and synergistic with the framework policies applied by G20 governments in their efforts to pursue strong and sustainable growth. The report, has been prepared in response to the request from G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in their communication of 25-26 February 2012 that asked the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with the World Bank and the United Nation (UN), to prepare a report that provides options for G20 countries on inserting green growth and sustainable development policies into structural reform agendas, tailored to specific country conditions and level of development. The report will be an input to the G-20 leader's summit in Los Cabos and provides a toolkit of policy options from which countries may draw-upon when designing their own green growth strategies. The G20 development working group has also tasked the International Organizations with the development of a non-prescriptive toolkit of policy options to support inclusive green growth in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication in developing countries.;;"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);World Bank Group;United Nations";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-06-30;en;"climate change;deforestation;fisheries;land degradation;land use;property rights;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27111;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27111/1/705020WP00PUBL0ural0Reform0Agendas0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27111/705020WP00PUBL0ural0Reform0Agendas0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Compared to neighboring countries, it is still lacking in its basic infrastructure and its administrative and technical skills. In addition, with the onset of the War in Yugoslavia in 1992 most investment and normal maintenance came to a standstill. Much of the publicly owned infrastructure fell into disrepair or was vandalized, but private investments led to a construction boom which, however, is leading to many environmental problems. The government is committed to reconstruction and to the development of a peaceful state. It also intends to align with EU policies. Thus, the study has the specific objectives to: (i) assist the government to improve its river basin planning and management by providing (for demonstration purposes) a replicable tool and simulation model for integrated river basin planning and management; and (ii) support the government in its identification of priority measures of structural and non-structural nature to help strengthen the water resources sector performance.

handle:10986/27117;Enhancing Carbon Stocks and Reducing CO2 Emissions in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Projects;Toolkit;There is global interest in promoting mitigation and adaptation in agriculture, forest, and other land-use (AFOLU) sectors to address the twin goals of climate change and sustainable development. This guideline deals with how to enhance carbon stocks in general in all land-based projects and its specific relationship with agriculture productivity. It outlines specific steps and procedures that need to be followed by project proponents and managers of land-based projects to enhance carbon stocks synergistically with increasing crop productivity. This guideline for carbon stock enhancement or CO2 emission reduction in agriculture and natural resource management (NRM) projects covering all land-use sectors presents two approaches. The first approach is a generic one covering all the land categories and interventions aimed at promoting the economic benefits (crop, timber, and non-timber wood product production, and employment or livelihood generation) and environmental benefits (soil and water conservation, land reclamation, and biodiversity protection) of a project, synergistically optimizing carbon stock enhancement as a co-benefit. The second approach provides guidelines for project developers to maximize project C-benefits along with promoting high-value cropping systems and production practices appropriate for a given agro-ecological region as well as to meet the needs of the local stakeholders, such as farmers or landless laborers. An illustration of the two approaches is presented at the end of the executive summary. The guidelines provide methods for selection and incorporation of carbon stock enhancement modules and practices along with methods for estimation and monitoring of carbon stock changes as well as assessment of social and economic implications of carbon enhancement (C-enhancement) interventions.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-02-28;en;"agriculture;climate change;desertification;forest conservation;forest land;forestry;land degradation;land management;land use;sustainable development;waste";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs;Manuals & Guidelines";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27117;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27117/1/704030WP00PUBL00Stocks00Toolkit0web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27117/704030WP00PUBL00Stocks00Toolkit0web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27119;Strategic Environmental Assessment in the World Bank;Learning from Recent Experience and Challenges;This report presents the results of a review of the World Bank's Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) experience undertaken by the World Bank learning community-the SEA Community of Practice (CoP). This report is no more than a first step. Its findings and results cannot be treated as conclusive. The World Bank follows the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in describing SEA as 'analytical and participatory approaches to strategic decision-making that aim to integrate environmental considerations into policies, plans and programs, and evaluate the inter linkages with economic and social considerations'. Over time SEA has become more strategic by bringing different groups of stakeholders into an environmental and social dialogue in an iterative and adaptive way. Impact-centered approaches to SEA best fit to integrate environmental considerations in plans and programs where environmental impacts and risks can be identified and predicted. Country environmental analysis is a type of policy SEA developed to inform the dialogue between the Bank and client countries on national environmental priorities. The main objective is to strengthen Bank staff's capacity on SEA by fostering learning in applying SEA in World Bank-supported projects and thus contribute to sustainable development outcomes in programs, plans, and policies of client countries. To achieve this objective, among other activities of the SEA CoP, there is a component to take stock of the Bank's recent regional experience with the following scope of work. The structure of this report organized as: chapter two presents the synthesis and conclusions from the cross-analysis of the regional reviews. Chapters three through eight present the findings and conclusions of the regional reviews. Chapter three on the SEA experience in East Asia and the Pacific focuses on the use of SEA mainly as a tool for environmental safeguarding. Chapter four analyzes the use of SEA as a planning and policy tool drawing on the Middle East and North Africa experience. A mixed experience with impact-centered and policy SEA approaches is described by chapter five on South Asia. Chapter six on Sub-Saharan Africa shows a trend of using SEA initially for environmental safeguarding but later for informing policy making. Chapter seven shows that sector reforms and infrastructure developments have influenced the use of SEA in Latin America. And the mixed results of promoting SEA practice by making it regionally mandatory through the European Union's SEA directive are described in chapter eight on Europe and Central Asia.;Loayza, Fernando;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-09-30;en;"agriculture;climate change;deforestation;forestry;land degradation;land use;rural development;sustainable development;water management";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27119;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27119/1/804910WP0Strat0Box0379805B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27119/804910WP0Strat0Box0379805B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27120;Agricultural Education, Science and Modern Technology's Role in Solving the Problems of Global Food Resources in the 21st Century;;The growth of agriculture output over the past 200 years has been phenomenal. When Malthus wrote in 1798, he perceived limits on agricultural production as serious and imminent. Since then world population has increased by six-fold and global agricultural production has more than kept pace. Falling real grain prices for most of the 20th Century are cited as evidence. The sources of the increase in food production, however, have been quite different and have come in distinct waves. For most of the 19th century, increased output came from expanded land area in production. Science-based agriculture is really a post-Mendel phenomenon. In the 20th century, new technology came in different forms. First, mechanical technology, particularly the tractor, made possible cultivating more acres and freed enormous areas used for producing fuel for draft animals, for food production. Improvements in breeding and agronomy in the middle part of the century opened the possibility of substantially increasing yields per unit of land through the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As we look to the 21st century, this conference is asking a critical question about the role of knowledge, science and technology in meeting future global food needs.;McCalla, Alex F.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;1998-12-31;en;"agriculture;decentralization;deforestation;farmers;farming systems;fisheries;food security;land degradation;land use;rural development;urbanization";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27120;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27120/1/716730WP00PUBL00AMcCalla0GlobalFood.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27120/716730WP00PUBL00AMcCalla0GlobalFood.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27122;Facilitating Short and Longer-Term Supply Response to Higher and More Volatile Food Prices;;International food prices spiked for the second time in four years in early 2011, igniting concerns about a repeat of the 2008 food price crisis and its consequences for the poor. International food price uncertainty has also increased along with average levels. Although price volatility is an intrinsic characteristic of agricultural markets, it has increased markedly over the last five years, compared to the previous two and a half decades, even when controlling for inflation. More adverse weather conditions in the main producing regions, rising land and water constraints, and stronger linkages with more volatile oil prices, including through biofuels, tend to place upward pressure on food price volatility. These factors are likely to persist in the short-to medium-term suggesting that volatility may be higher in the future than that observed in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Episodes of high prices and extreme volatility create uncertainty that is a major threat to food security in developing countries. Farmers deciding what to plant, and countries deciding when to import, face significant uncertainty with respect to the distribution of future food prices. While producers who are net sellers have welcomed recent periods of high prices, uncertainty as to post-harvest prices is a disincentive to a strong supply response, especially in poorer developing countries. Finally, there is a need to improve the access of farmers to appropriate price risk management tools (financial services, including saving mobilization) to reduce the negative impact of price volatility on production decision and help ensure supply response to higher prices. Improving access to infrastructure, maintaining low inflation (precautionary savings), and financial sector development (reflective of risk management capacity) can help to reduce the negative effective effects of price volatility on production decisions.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-04-30;en;"agriculture;climate change;food security;property rights;transaction costs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27122;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27122/1/712650WP0WB0CP00Box370065B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27122/712650WP0WB0CP00Box370065B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

This note summarizes the results of the analysis presented in the report. Besides the existing mechanism for temporary crediting, the study analyzed a range of alternative approaches to addressing non-permanence, including those considered in prior deliberations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The approaches address the risk of non-permanence in several ways. Under the tonne year accounting, credits are issued for the increments of carbon sequestered corresponding to a defined permanence period, and their quantity depends on the carbon stored in biomass each year of the permanence period. However, this approach has not been implemented by any standard. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, but can be used in tandem with each other.;"Murray, Brian C.

handle:10986/27131;Zimbabwe Public Administration Review;Initial Reflections on Public Sector Reform to Support the Economic and Social Recovery of Zimbabwe;In early 2010, Zimbabwe's Minister of Public Service requested Bank support for a public administration review to provide analytical support and technical assistance to identify the key issues to restore the quality of public administration in Zimbabwe. This policy note presents an initial framing of recent public administration reform experiences and lessons learned in Zimbabwe and set the agenda for future client engagement with a view to present reform options. It has the following objectives: first, it intends to situate and analyze the current progress made and challenges facing the Zimbabwe public service in its wider and rapidly changing - economic and political context. Second, it aims at presenting the Bank's engagement in this area over the last three years and to synthesize what has been learned. Third, it identifies reform options given the current context and gives possible future entry-points. It mainly aims at providing an initial basis for client-engagement to reach a broad consensus on reform and the potential areas of Bank support. This note is structured into five chapters as follows: chapter one presents the introduction to this paper and the country context in Zimbabwe. Chapter two frames the role of the public administration in economic and social recovery and presents progress made and challenges in public administration reform. Chapter three discusses recent Bank support in key public sector management areas. Chapter four presents lessons learned by the Bank team throughout its recent engagement. Chapter five evaluates the reform space, options, priorities, and entry points.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-06-30;en;"capacity building;land;property rights";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;ZWE";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27131;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27131/1/690420WP0Zimba0ox0379860B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27131/690420WP0Zimba0ox0379860B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The analysis draws on the competitive city framework which includes four pillars: 1. institutions and regulations; 2. infrastructure and land; 3. skills and innovation; 4. enterprise support and finance. It analyzes factors that constrain city competiveness, the role that city governments can play, and provides policy recommendations based on both the Filipino and international good practices in promoting city competitiveness. In addition, policy note studies the enabling environment at the national level to foster city competitiveness. Literature reviews, analysis of national level data and the results of firm level surveys and focus group meetings enrich the analysis. The policy note discusses 5 key challenges which affect economic development and job creation at the city level: 1) poor business environment; 2) weak infrastructure, land management and access to markets; 3) low demand for innovation and skill match; 4) access to finance and business support; and 5) inefficient economic planning, unclear mandate and weak governance. The analysis of these challenges is followed by a discussion of recommended priority actions. Despite a number of issues being addressed through reforms, more efforts are required at local and national level to improve the business environment, access to land and markets and upgrading of infrastructure, strengthening innovation systems and addressing skills mismatch, improving access to finance and business support services, and strengthening local institutions for economic development. Recommendations focus on areas which are most likely to offer quick results in terms of improving city competitiveness and where cities themselves have an important role to play as they are less dependent on national reforms. These include: 1. improving the business regulatory environment; 2. strengthening business support and innovation; 3. reforming institutions for economic development.";;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-05-31;en;urbanization;Urban Tenure;;"030;009;PHL";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27140;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27140/1/115308-PN-P156898-PUBLIC-Policy-Notes-Competitive-Cities-FINAL2.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27140/115308-PN-P156898-PUBLIC-Policy-Notes-Competitive-Cities-FINAL2.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27142;Improving Land Administration and Management for Sustainable Urban Development;Philippines Urbanization Review Policy Notes;"This policy note assesses the performance of existing land administration and management (LAM) system in the Philippines in creating an environment for competitive cities. It looks at the influence of LAM (including property rights) in the proper functioning of land markets in urban areas; the effectiveness of land use planning and regulations in shaping urban growth, reducing informality, and improving efficiency in use of space; and the impacts of property valuation and taxation practices in generating revenues to finance local development plans. LAM systems are a fundamental infrastructure for proper functioning of land markets. Well-functioning land markets facilitate investments and growth, improve land allocation, and develop financial markets. For land markets to work efficiently, they must be underpinned by land administration systems that define property rights; guarantee security of tenure; establish a mechanism for registering these rights within reasonable time and costs, and generate information to support property valuation and taxation. Well-defined property rights underpin security of transactions and investments in well-functioning land markets, as these reduce conflicts, decrease transaction costs, and provide incentives for the private sector to invest. Property valuation facilitates efficient disposal and proper compensation of land, equitable land and property taxation, and proper valuation of land as collateral assets. In addition, LAM systems are essential in land use planning that shapes urban growth, improves efficiencies in use and allocation of limited space, and in turn, enhances the performance of land markets. In metropolitan areas, coordinated land use planning is essential to achieve efficiency in service provision, enable connectivity and maximize the potential of agglomeration for city competitiveness. Effective land use planning enables timely provision of investments to influence the shape and pattern of land development. Well-functioning land market and efficient land use are important in creating sustainable and competitive cities.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-05-31;en;"land administration;urbanization;land use;land use planning";Urban Tenure;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;PHL";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27142;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27142/1/115311-PN-P156898-PUBLIC-Policy-Notes-Land-Administration-and-Management-FINAL2.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27142/115311-PN-P156898-PUBLIC-Policy-Notes-Land-Administration-and-Management-FINAL2.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27143;Strengthening Institutions for Urban and Metropolitan Management and Service Delivery;Philippines Urbanization Review Policy Notes;"This policy note discusses strengthening institutions for urban and metropolitan management and service delivery and is part of a broader Philippines urbanization study. Strong institutions are critical to the effective management of cities, the delivery of efficient urban services and infrastructure, and the establishment of an enabling environment for business and job creation. Strong institutions are needed to design and support policies for land and housing markets, raise and equitably redistribute revenues, and promote a safe and sustainable urban environment both at the national and local levels. A number of underlying institutional and governance issues at national and metropolitan levels in the Philippines stand out as binding constraints which have limited the country from optimizing the benefits of urban development. Even as the share of the national population living in urban areas has expanded to around 50 percent, urbanization in the country has never been guided by a comprehensive urban development policy supported by a clearly defined institutional framework. Institutional fragmentation among various oversight and sectorial agencies at the national level has exacerbated the weak institutional environment for urban development. The continuing expansion and population growth of urban areas throughout the country heightens the urgency for adopting comprehensive urban policy and institutional reforms that will enable the country to harness the benefits of urban development and mitigate negative externalities. There are a number of key challenges related to governance and institutions that are hampering successful urbanization: (i) absence of a comprehensive national urban policy; (ii) absence of a lead agency for urban development; (iii) weaknesses in the fiscal decentralization framework; and (iv) metropolitan fragmentation and weak mechanisms for inter-jurisdictional coordination.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-05-31;en;"urbanization;decentralization";Urban Tenure;;"030;009;PHL";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27143;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27143/1/115312-PN-P156898-PUBLIC-Policy-Notes-Urban-Institutions-FINAL2.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27143/115312-PN-P156898-PUBLIC-Policy-Notes-Urban-Institutions-FINAL2.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27148;Ukraine Systematic Country Diagnostic;Toward Sustainable Recovery and Shared Prosperity;"Ukraine has tremendous potential that has not yet been reached. Ukraine is endowed with intelligent, energetic, and entrepreneurial people; extraordinary fertile land; considerable natural resources; and a geographic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. There is no reason why Ukraine, under the right conditions, should not be among the league of prosperous and successful nations. The circumstances today, however, are of course, still far from that ultimate target. Ukraine’s GDP per person in 2015 was $2,115, while the corresponding figure was $12,500 for Poland, around $9,000 for Turkey and Romania, and $9,800 for Malaysia, and $13,000 for Argentina. The flip side of the current circumstances is that if Ukraine is able to put in place the right conditions, it will experience a period of strong economic growth as it catches up and converges to the levels of income of more prosperous nations. This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Ukraine is intended as an evidence based diagnostic of the constraints and priorities to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way. The SCD is intended as an evidence?based and integrative analytical report, combining analysis of growth, inclusion, and sustainability. The SCD is not intended to be limited to expected areas of World Bank Group (WBG) engagement, but is instead intended to assess what the country itself should do to advance its growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity objectives in a sustainable way. This SCD is structured as follows. The next section covers the analysis of growth and sustainability. The third section covers the analysis of poverty and shared prosperity. The fourth section uses the analysis from the prior two sections to lay out the framework for the SCD, including the constraints and pathways to sustainable recovery and shared prosperity for Ukraine.

handle:10986/27152;Calculating Multi-hazard City Risk;;Nearly half of East Asia population lives in cities and the region is urbanizing so rapidly that built up areas are projected to increase faster here than in any other region in the next twenty years. Still, more than half of slum dwellers around the world live in East Asia. These are the people most vulnerable to disaster impacts. Given that Asia accounted for more than a third of the number of all reported disasters in 2010, and that natural disasters have quadrupled in the region during the past twenty years the fastest rate of increase of any region in the world managing urban growth for resilience is increasingly important. And yet, many cities do not have master plans to guide their projected growth, let alone tools for risk sensitive land use planning. The impetus for action will come from accessible tools that allow local policymakers to first minimize risk today and then think about addressing future risk. This methodology report describes the underlying risk components, including a description of the models required inputs related to metropolitan elements at risk, hazard sub-indices for thirteen hazard types and thirty parameters of physical, socioeconomic, and institutional vulnerability. In addition to this report, three city reports present results that can be used by a variety of users from those interested in the overall city wide risk from all natural hazards to those interested in more disaggregated information.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-09-26;en;"climate change;land use;natural disasters";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27152;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27152/1/773680WP0FINAL00Box377296B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27152/773680WP0FINAL00Box377296B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27153;Stagnation or Revival?;Palestinian Economic Prospects;This report begins by documenting the Palestinian Authority's (PA's) ongoing fiscal crisis that threatens its ability to provide basic services to the population. In 2011, the PA required about US$1.5 billion dollars in budget support, of which US$200 million to cover development expenses not funded directly by donors. However, it only received about US$814 million in budget support and US$169 million in development financing, for a total of US$983 million. Ultimately, the PA can only hope to achieve fiscal sustainability through a combination of sustained private sector growth and continued internal reforms. Robust private sector growth is necessary for the PA to generate the revenues needed to sustain service delivery. Yet the private sector remains stifled as a result of Israeli restrictions on access to natural resources and markets. The West Bank has experienced a slowdown in economic growth in 2011, combined with double-digit growth in Gaza. The recovery in Gaza can be attributed to a combination of aid inflows and easing of restrictions on entry of goods from Israel-though it is important to keep in mind that the average Gaza today is worse off than s/he was back in the late nineties. The recent growth in Gaza is also driven largely by a boom in the construction sector, and Gaza infrastructure exhibits such gaps and disrepair that major investments are necessary and would generate important employment as well as future growth. The slowdown in growth in the West Bank, on the other hand, is the result of falling donor support, uncertainty caused by the PA's fiscal crisis, and lack of significant new easing of restrictions by the Government of Israel (GoI).;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-03-21;en;"land administration;land registration";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"145;015;PSE";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27153;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27153/1/760220WP0GZ0AH020Box374357B0PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27153/760220WP0GZ0AH020Box374357B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27154;Sustaining Achievements in Palestinian Institution-Building and Economic Growth;;Sustainable economic growth and strong institutions are interlinked, and the present report summarizes recent economic and fiscal developments in West Bank and Gaza (WB&G) as well as providing a broad overview of institutional accomplishments to date. The present report begins by discussing the apparent slowdown in economic growth in WB&G and the current fiscal crisis facing the Palestinian Authority (PA)-resulting partly from lower-than-expected external support this year. A further drop in donor funding would likely reduce growth, which would in turn further aggravate the fiscal situation in the coming year. A protracted fiscal crisis, in turn, risks jeopardizing the gains made in institution-building and thereby losing what has been painstakingly achieved over the past years. In addition, the report highlights that in order for the PA to sustain the reform momentum and its achievements in institution-building, remaining Israeli restrictions must be lifted and any reductions in international aid flows must be carefully calibrated and managed. Economic growth in WB&G has slowed down in 2011, and together with the shortfall in external financing, this has led to a fiscal crisis for the PA. Economic growth in WB&G remains robust but appears to be slowing due to economic and political uncertainty, so that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised the projected real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for 2011 from 9 down to 7 percent.

handle:10986/27158;Good Urban Governance through ICT;Issues, Analysis, and Strategies;"Africa is currently experiencing the world's fastest urbanization rate at 3.5 percent annually-placing increasing pressure on resource-constrained local governments to maintain and improve livability standards of their cities. But simultaneously, an 'Information and Communication Technologies' (ICT) revolution has swept across the continent-as evidenced by vastly improved telecommunications and internet infrastructure, leapfrogging mobile communications penetration rates, and emergence of a successful homegrown IT applications industry. This report aims to: 1) synthesize the role currently played by ICT towards improved governance, management and accountability of urban service providers in Africa as well as other regions, 2) explore current ICT initiatives that are relevant to the World Bank's thematic concerns, 3) reconcile existing deficiencies/barriers towards potential for replication, and 4) develop a roadmap to render easy strategy implementation by project teams. Section one outlines evolving trends in urban governance and presents ICT as a potential tool in the environment of modern governance. Section two discusses the role of ICT in some of the Bank's core areas of urban focus, namely: local governance and economic development; intergovernmental fiscal relations and municipal finance; urban poverty and slum upgrading; urban planning, land and housing; urban environment and climate change; and water and sanitation service delivery. An analysis of fundamental ICT methodologies employed is discussed in section three. Section four, in conclusion, suggests an action-plan for enhancing ICT initiatives as a component of the Bank's lending activities.";"Relhan, Gaurav

handle:10986/27162;Participatory Forest Management and REDD+ in Tanzania;;Tanzania's land, local government and forest laws mean that rural communities have well defined rights to own, manage and benefit from forest and woodland resources within their local areas through the establishment of village forests. This approach, known by practitioners as Community Based Forest Management (CBFM) results in the legal establishment of village land forest reserves, community forest reserves or private forests. By 2008, 1,460 villages on mainland Tanzania1 were involved in establishing or managing village forests covering a total of over 2.345 million hectares. A further 863 villages are currently involved in Joint Forest Management (JFM) approaches within government forest reserves, in which management responsibilities are shared between government and local communities. 1.78 million hectares of forest reserve under central or local government jurisdiction are now under JFM arrangements. Since 2008, the Tanzanian government has been making preparations for the establishment of systems and structures for REDD Plus (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Tanzania is being supported in its preparations by the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), UN-REDD plus and the Norwegian Forests and Climate Initiative as well as a number of local and international Non Government Organizations (NGOs). This report has been prepared to provide inputs to the development of policy processes currently evolving in Tanzania regarding REDD plus. This review draws on almost two decades of experience within Tanzania on the development and establishment of Participatory forest management (PFM) an approach which (like REDD plus), aims to achieve the combined objectives of sustainable forest management with secure rights, improved local forest governance and secure livelihoods for forest-dependent communities.;"Blomley, Tom

In order for REDD+ to achieve these objectives, effective benefit sharing systems will need to be implemented. Benefit sharing in REDD+ could take a wide variety of forms depending on the policies used to achieve REDD+ objectives. However, common to all approaches is the need for clear processes to determine actors' eligibility, the scale of benefits (and costs) and the governance arrangements. While many of the general concerns about benefit sharing within communities are widely referenced (e.g., elite capture), relatively less is known about how benefits are actually shared within communities and the implications in terms of economic opportunities, empowerment and vulnerability. There is also surprisingly little empirical evidence on the implications of different benefit sharing approaches for the poor in the different examples reviewed; for example, in terms of questions about whether benefits have actually compensated people adequately, helped to lift people out of poverty or deal with temporary shocks. These issues need to be much better understood within emerging REDD+ projects and programs, which in many cases have an objective to benefit those affected by REDD+ implementation.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"compensation;decentralization;land management;land ownership;land tenure;land use";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27163;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27163/1/658580WP00PUBL0ng0and0Carbon0Rights.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27163/658580WP00PUBL0ng0and0Carbon0Rights.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27165;Carbon Rights in Ghana;;For Ghana's national REDD plus scheme to be viable, the rights to carbon or the emission credits generated must be clearly delineated, and be accompanied by equitable and efficient benefit sharing systems. There are a number of approaches that the State can use to determine whom to vest the right to carbon in. If defined as a natural resource, the state would be vested with the rights. If recognized as an ecosystem service, then the right to the benefits would be vested in the owner of the trees. In the latter case, the beneficiaries will differ depending on whether the trees are naturally occurring or planted. The main opportunities in REDD plus in Ghana are in the forestation and reforestation of forestlands and degraded lands. It is possible that REDD plus could provide additional resources to build on existing systems that promote tree planting on degraded land, such as the National Forest Plantation Development Plan (NFPDP), by providing additional incentives in reserve and off-reserve areas.;Osafo, Y.

Recognizing that response needs are currently recognizing that response needs are currently being addressed, this note focuses on policy changes that can address long term vulnerabilities related to the drought.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-09-30;en;"agriculture;climate change;farmers;food security;land tenure";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;KEN";"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27166;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27166/1/667150WP00PUBL0Horn0Africa00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27166/667150WP00PUBL0Horn0Africa00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27168;Land Redistribution in South Africa;A Critical Review;This paper provides an overview of land reform in South Africa from 1994 to 2011, with the focus on the land redistribution. The government policies and associated implementation since 1994 have not generated expected social and economic results for a number of reasons. Even where land has been transferred, it appears to have had minimal impact on the livelihoods of beneficiaries, largely because of inappropriate project design, a lack of necessary support services and shortages of working capital, leading to widespread underutilization of land. There is no evidence to suggest that land reform has led to improvements in agricultural efficiency, income, employment or economic growth. Therefore, the current approach, based on acquisition of land through the open market, minimal support to new farmers, and bureaucratic imposition of production models loosely based on existing commercial operators, is unlikely to transform the rural economy and lift people out of poverty. The paper argues that there are two important missing aspects in the land reform program. First, there is an absence of any viable small-farmer path to development, which could enable the millions of households residing in the communal areas and on commercial farms to expand their own production and accumulate wealth and resources in an incremental manner. Making this happen would require radical restructuring of existing farm units to create family-size farms, more realistic farm planning, appropriate support from a much-reformed state agricultural service, and a much greater role for beneficiaries in the design and implementation of their own projects. Second, what is clearly missing from the governance tradition is the sustained focus on implementation, resource mobilization, and timely policy adjustment. Much more will be required for land reform program to contribute significantly to economic growth and to the redistribution of wealth and opportunities to the majority of the population.;"Lahiff, Edward

handle:10986/27216;Unlocking Central America's Export Potential;Value Chain Analyses;"The Central America region is a small market. The region contains around 43 million inhabitants (0.6 percent of total world population) who generate around 0.25 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While the region has successfully embarked on a regional integration agenda and has strong commercial links with the US, extra-regional trade-mainly with large fast-growing emerging economies-remains a challenge. Export performance is analyzed along three dimensions that, together, give a fairly comprehensive picture of competitiveness: 1) the composition, orientation and growth of the export basket; 2) the degree of export diversification across products and markets; and 3) the level of sophistication and quality of their main exports. This analysis allows exports dynamics at the different margins of trade (intensive, extensive, and quality) to be evaluated and individual countries' to be benchmarked with peers in the Central American region. The results of this report allow policy makers to identify key areas to explore in the overall discussion of export competitiveness in the Central American region. This paper relates to the literature on challenges and opportunities that trade liberalization can bring to the Central American region. Much of the recent literature focuses on the role of the free trade agreement negotiated by Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, with the US.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-10-31;en;"aquaculture;capacity building;land use;land use planning";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"013;419";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27216;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27216/1/750700WP0v200B0ses020120vF00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27216/750700WP0v200B0ses020120vF00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

This handbook provides an overview of efforts and achievements in subnational investment climate reforms. It is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews a number of countries experiences with subnational reforms, noting both success stories and disappointments and pointing toward lessons learned. Chapter 3 sets out the basic principles of subnational revenue, including business taxation. Chapter 4 describes sound licensing practices for subnational governments, including establishing licensing fees. Chapter 5 provides recommendations for subnational reform projects where both the regulatory authority and taxation require attention, which is the most common situation. Finally, the Appendix offers nine case studies covering subnational reform efforts in the following countries: Canada (British Columbia), The Russian Federation, China, Kenya, Tanzania, Peru (Lima), The Balkans (Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), Tajikistan, and Zambia.;;"International Finance Cooperation;World Bank Group;Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"cadastres;capacity building;decentralization;land;land use";;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27217;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27217/1/826030WP0Fisca00Box379865B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27217/826030WP0Fisca00Box379865B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27221;Tunisia;From Revolutions to Institutions;In the wake of the revolution, Tunisian society is currently undergoing a significant transformation. In late 2011, the country's first representative government in more than three decades was formed, as the Constituent Assembly was seated. Hundreds of legitimate candidates ran in an election that was free, fair, and enjoyed nearly 90 percent participation by eligible voters. 'Tunisia: from revolutions to institutions,' published one year after the exile of Ben Ali, seeks to describe the factors driving this transformation, examining how specific elements of society have changed, or not changed, in the post-revolutionary period. Information and communication technologies (ICTs), which played a central role in the lead-up to the revolution as well as the revolution itself, have continued to influence rapid changes in the past year. This report charts the application of these technologies by citizens, civil society, entrepreneurs, and government stakeholders. It also identifies openings to capitalize on technology's ability to improve governance, expand economic opportunity, and encourage social cohesion.;"Brisson, Zack

handle:10986/27226;Societal Dynamics & Fragility;Engaging Societies in Responding to Fragile Situations;Extreme fragile situations are now home to at least a quarter of the worlds people. In the worst cases, where fragility has given way to open violence - people are more than twice as likely to be malnourished, more than three times as likely to be unable to send their children to school, twice as likely to see their children die before age five, and more than twice as likely to lack clean water. It is unsurprising that not a single low-income country in these circumstances has been able to achieve even one Millennium Development Goal (World Bank 2011). In addition, many fragile situations generate spillover effects such as trafficking in illegal goods and persons, and corruption, which threaten the stability of neighboring countries (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD 2005, 2010). This study views fragility as not only a problem of state capacity, but also of relationships in society. That is, while some elements of fragility emanate from the state, others are deeply rooted in societal dynamics, the way individuals and groups interact and the relationships that form out of these interactions.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"capacity building;common law;corruption;land tenure;property rights;rural areas;rural development;urbanization;youth";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27226;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27226/1/691620WP00PUBL0agility0Summary0WEB0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27226/691620WP00PUBL0agility0Summary0WEB0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27227;Agro-Logistics in Central America;A Supply Chain Approach;This chapter uses supply chain analysis (SCA) to identify transport and logistics bottlenecks that add costs, times and uncertainty to the exportation of perishable agricultural products from Central America. Macro-level analyses of logistics performance, including the logistics performance index, Doing Business Reports and Enterprise Surveys of the World Bank, as well as the Global Competitiveness Index of the Global Economic Forum, often leave policy-makers unclear on exactly what poor performance means for exporters and producers in Central America. How does poor road quality eat away at the profit margins of my country's producers? Extensive procedures add time to export processes, but how much time? How and to what extend does this additional time hurt the competitiveness of key industries? How does this effect vary by product type? By tracking the movement of seven carefully selected exports, these supply chains complement macro-level analyses by answering these questions for some of the region's key agricultural exports. A range of unique characteristics makes the success of perishable exports exceedingly dependent on the efficiency of the related logistics systems and the ability to connect effectively and reliably to global supply chains. Remote production zones add cost, time and variability to transport from the farm gate to the distribution, collection or processing center. Increasingly complicated international sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) add institutional and procedural complexity to the supply chain. Above all, the time sensitivity of most perishable products increases the value of time and makes cold chain infrastructure and the availability of refrigerated containers essential for successful exportation.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-06-30;en;agriculture;;;"013;419";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27227;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27227/1/750970WP0Agro000Box374299B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27227/750970WP0Agro000Box374299B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27229;Energy Efficient Inland Water Transport in Bangladesh;;IWT is more energy efficient that modes like road or rail. The bigger capacity of IWT units means that the sector is able to ship more tons per kilometer per unit of fuel than what is possible with other modes. This benefits the climate and makes the sector relatively cost-efficient. Even so, few countries fully exploit the potential benefits of IWT and in many countries the share of road transport is increasing at the cost of IWT. There are various possible reasons for this trend. Among the main reasons given by shippers to avoid IWT are advantages of road transport such as speed of delivery and flexibility, limitations imposed by IWT infrastructure (water levels, bridge clearances, port access) and underdeveloped intermodal facilities (transshipment from IWT to truck for pre- and end-haulage). For shippers these arguments are more important than the potential reduction of transport costs and CO2 emissions. Chapter two compares the global energy-efficiency of IWT with that of other transport modes. It also discusses the reasons for differences between modes and the implications of each for CO2 emissions. Chapter three deal with the varying energy-performance of IWT vessels in various regions in the world. Chapter four explores several energy efficiency benchmarking methods. The conclusions of part A are presented in chapter five.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;climate change;Land, Climate change & Environment;;"BGD;034";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27229;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27229/1/815690WP0Trans00Box379840B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27229/815690WP0Trans00Box379840B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27230;Freight Flows,Logistics Costs, and Efficiency;Optimal Path Analysis;In Central America, cargo is transported almost entirely by road. The movement of imports and exports to and from international seaports is done by truck. Rail service is almost nonexistent and air transport serves less than one percent of the cargo generated within the Central American Common Market (SIECA, 2004). Intra-regional trade is much more important in Central America than it might seem at first glance. The second largest trading partner of Central America is the region itself. In 2010, one quarter of the exports from Central America were destined for final consumption within the region. Half of the exports of Central America (54 percent in 2010) correspond to agricultural products and a large proportion of them supply markets inside the region. Nearly 40 percent of intra-regional exports consist of food, beverages, animals and plants (SIECA, 2011). Perishable food products are transported on trucks, and spatially restricted by the geography and the road infrastructure. In this context, inefficiencies in the supply chain and delays in freight flows lead to economic losses and amplify the negative impact of the distance to the markets on trade. A gravity model of trade showed that the negative effect of distance1 on total intra-regional exports is 77 percent higher in Central America than in the European Union (World Bank, 2010). More precisely, an increase in distance by 1 percent is expected to reduce intra-regional bilateral exports in Central America by 1.65 percent. In terms of volume, the negative effect of distance within the region exceeds the effect in Europe by 50 percent in grains and up to 550 percent in processed food. In the latter case, an increase in distance by 1 percent is expected to reduce intra-regional bilateral exports of processed food in Central America by 2.88 percent.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-06-30;en;land use;;Land Use, Management & Investment;"NIC;013;419";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27230;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27230/1/750990WP0Optim00Box374299B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27230/750990WP0Optim00Box374299B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27231;Indonesia - The Rise of Metropolitan Regions;Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Regional Development;In recent years, Indonesia has made great strides in economic growth and development. This growth has been accompanied by rapid urbanization that has transformed Indonesian cities. Urbanization has the potential to boost national economic growth by facilitating the emergence of agglomeration and localization economies. Increasing urbanization presents Indonesia with an opportunity to leverage the transformation taking place to ensure that it is harnessed for economic growth and, more importantly, sustained improvements in the quality of life of its community members. Unfortunately, research shows that over the last four decades, Indonesia has not derived optimal returns on urban development, as can be seen by comparisons with the level of benefit derived by other Asian countries passing through similar processes of urbanization. Urbanization in Indonesia is driving the emergence of metropolitan areas whose boundaries stretch beyond the jurisdiction of administratively defined cities, creating an urgent need for mechanisms that optimize and coordinate development beyond the formal city unit. The purpose of this report on Indonesia's regional and urban development is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the country's spatial patterns of urbanization and economic development and to evaluate the extent to which Indonesia's urbanization has fostered increases in agglomeration economies and economic productivity growth. The study provides the analytical work to evaluate such performance and to identify key issues, constraints and opportunities for promoting faster and more inclusive growth. The overarching goal of the study is to provide a timely and rigorous analysis of regional and urban development in order to foster informed policy discussion at the central, provincial and local government levels.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"land management;land use;natural disasters;property rights;rural areas;rural population;urban areas;urban planning;urban population;urbanization;waste";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27231;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27231/1/717400WP00PUBL020FINAL0to0PRINTING0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27231/717400WP00PUBL020FINAL0to0PRINTING0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27232;Policy Note on the Business Environment for Inclusive Business Models;;This policy note has two goals. First, to assess whether inclusive business models face specific regulatory hurdles. Second, to recommend policies that creates a business environment conducive to inclusive business. Little research has been conducted on the first goal. This note analyzes survey answers from companies that applied to the G20 Challenge. These companies were asked to rank regulatory obstacles and explain whether these obstacles created significant hurdles to their ability to serve the base of the pyramid. On the second goal, this note highlights policy recommendations for governments, development finance institutions and donors. It also includes policy measures specific to countries and contexts. Some policy measures address regulatory hurdles for inclusive business models. Others support inclusive business models by providing incentives when needed. The first section analyzes survey answers from the 167 applicants for the G20 Challenge. The starting point was to listen to businesses a logical place to begin when seeking to improve the business environment. The second section describes policy measures for business models that include the base of the pyramid as producers or suppliers, focusing on agriculture. Businesses that source from small farmers have inclusive business models because they integrate farmers in their value chains. Small farmers are often considered base of the pyramid if their income is low or they lack basic goods or services. The third section describes policy measures for business models that include the base of the pyramid as customers particularly models that provide affordable housing, health, education and basic financial services. In many countries basic services are still mainly provided by the public sector or recently privatized companies and more stringent regulations often apply. This section describes regulations and policies that affect inclusive business models in these sectors. The fourth section describes roles for governments, development finance institutions and donors in supporting inclusive business models. The business environment is important because companies that do business with the base of the pyramid need to understand new markets, understand the market behavior of base of the pyramid customers, appraise new risks and develop new systems, business processes and training. Companies with inclusive business models also face perceptions from investors and lending institutions that the base of the pyramid is riskier than other markets.;;International Finance Cooperation;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-12-31;en;"capacity building;fisheries;land administration;land titling;property rights;sustainable development;urban areas";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27232;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27232/1/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27232/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;International Finance Corporation ;
handle:10986/27240;Mongolia Quarterly Economic Update, February 2012;;Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth accelerated to an unprecedented 17.3 percent in 2011 from 6.4 percent in 2010 and the unemployment rate fell from 13 percent in 2010 to 9 percent in 2011. However, real wages for unskilled workers in the urban informal sector are starting to fall as the inflation rate reached 11.1 percent year-on-year in December. Sharply rising government spending is the root cause of overheating: government spending rose by 56 percent in 2011 and is budgeted to rise by a further 32 percent this year, fueled by sharply rising resource revenues. This pro-cyclical fiscal policy could result in another 'boom-and-bust' cycle Mongolia experienced before, particularly as the global economy could face a substantial slowdown in growth due to the continuing European sovereign debt crisis, and which could result in a sharp drop in mineral prices and subsequently government revenues There have been major legislative developments in 2011 and early 2012 aimed at strengthening policy institutions and frameworks. The Integrated Budget Law (IBL) was passed in December 2011: this organic budget law contains measures to support fiscal sustainability and the successful implementation of the Fiscal Stability Law. It also strengthens the public investment framework by requiring feasibility studies and alignment with national priorities for projects to be included in the Public Investment Program and the budget. The Social Welfare Law was passed in early January. This mandates the provision of a targeted poverty benefit replacing the existing system of universal cash transfers. To ensure macroeconomic stability and to prevent a hard landing for the economy in case of an adverse external shock, Mongolia needs to adhere strictly to prudent fiscal policies as set out in the FSL and IBL and tightening both fiscal and monetary policy to reduce inflation, take macro-prudential action to reduce systemic risks in the banking sector and maintain a flexible exchange rate that will act as the first buffer in any external shock materializes. These are uncertain times for Mongolia. The economy faces growing headwinds from the global economic environment, while the looming elections increase domestic uncertainty. Until a substantial amount of savings has accumulated in the stabilization fund, Mongolia remains strongly exposed to volatility in commodity prices.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2012-02-28;en;;;;"030;009;MNG";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27240;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27240/1/671320WP00PUBL0Update0February02012.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27240/671320WP00PUBL0Update0February02012.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27252;Russian Economic Report, No. 25, June 2011;Securing Stability and Growth;Russia has seen even higher oil windfall in the past few months, which translates into likely fiscal surpluses this year and next. The government should not miss the opportunity provided by a large oil windfall to substantially improve its long-term fiscal position, further reduce inflation, and, therefore, ensure a strong basis for durable stability and healthy growth in the future. Rising domestic demand and credit activity are increasingly supporting solid growth. Overall, labor market conditions improved recently while poverty was broadly flat during and after the crisis, but unemployment and poverty in many regions remain difficult. Further reductions in poverty will require greater policy focus and persistence in implementing more effective and targeted programs, especially in the poorest regions. Two new special-topic analyses focus on export diversification in Russia, and food and energy inflation in Europe and Central Asia region. In the first, results show that productivity is the key to exports and that lack of competition and entrepreneurial innovation are relevant obstacles to the emergence of new, potentially exportable products. In the second, it is shown that food and energy prices in Russia and other countries in Europe and Central Asia are contributing significantly to consumer price inflation, complicating anti-inflation policy and poverty reduction.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-06-30;en;"agriculture;forestry;property rights";Forest Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150;143;RUS";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27252;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27252/1/637540WP0June000Box0361531B0PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27252/637540WP0June000Box0361531B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27254;Kenya Economic Update, June 2011, Edition No. 4;Turning the Tide in Turbulent Times;Over the last decade, Kenya's society and economy have changed fundamentally and these deep trends will continue. Rapid population growth and urbanization will create many new challenges which need to be managed well to support Kenya's economic take-off in the medium-term. This fourth edition of the Kenya economic update argues that Kenya can turn the tide in turbulent times and make the most of the ongoing structural shifts. In 2011, Kenya will need to address short-term domestic and international shocks, including higher inflation, pressures on the exchange rate and, most importantly, a volatile political environment. The government will need to navigate through these shocks successfully and to continue with its economic reform program to achieve higher growth.

handle:10986/27268;Engaging the Private Sector in Results-Based Landscape Programs;Early Lessons from the World Bank’s Forests and Landscapes Climate Finance Funds;"This paper captures early observations by the World Bank Forests and Landscapes Climate Finance Funds in engaging the private sector, particularly multinational companies involved in global agricultural commodity supply chains, in the context of emission reductions programs to address land use change. The World Bank Group’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL) have spent years working with private sector companies that produce, trade or buy commodities that play a role in driving deforestation or forest degradation. These funds have gained valuable insights into what has worked, and what more is required to further shift private sector behavior toward sustainable business models.Relationship building can take time; governments need to better understand the role and implementation capacity of the private sector, and the private sector needs to understand the benefits of a government-led REDD+ and/or emission reductions program. Such partnerships, however, offer promising opportunities to use available climate-related finance to leverage much larger private investments that can support the objectives of the World Bank Forests and Landscapes Climate Finance Funds.While private sector engagement has many challenges to overcome, as summarized in Section two, many new cooperative relationships are being developed as part of the World Bank Forests and Landscapes Climate Finance Fund programs. Section three summarizes these emerging opportunities and ways in which the Forests and Landscapes Climate Finance Funds are overcoming some of the barriers to public-private cooperation. Gaps that remain are highlighted in Section four. The overall message is that private sector engagement requires long-term commitments and unique strategies to meet the needs of each country.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-06-30;en;;;;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27268;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27268/4/116412.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27268/116412.pdf.jpg?sequence=3&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The region contains around 43 million inhabitants (0.6 percent of total world population) who generate around 0.25 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While the region has successfully embarked on a regional integration agenda and has strong commercial links with the US, extra-regional trade-mainly with large fast-growing emerging economies-remains a challenge. Export performance is analyzed along three dimensions that, together, give a fairly comprehensive picture of competitiveness: 1) the composition, orientation and growth of the export basket; 2) the degree of export diversification across products and markets; and 3) the level of sophistication and quality of their main exports. This analysis allows exports dynamics at the different margins of trade (intensive, extensive, and quality) to be evaluated and individual countries' to be benchmarked with peers in the Central American region. The results of this report allow policy makers to identify key areas to explore in the overall discussion of export competitiveness in the Central American region. This paper relates to the literature on challenges and opportunities that trade liberalization can bring to the Central American region. Much of the recent literature focuses on the role of the free trade agreement negotiated by Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, with the US.";"Torero, Maximo

handle:10986/27273;The Scope for MDB Leverage and Innovation in Climate Finance;;"This note, prepared as background for the G20 submission, explores the potential for Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to increase the volume of climate financing by leveraging and intermediating resources, through two main avenues: leveraging shareholder capital through the MDBs non-concessional windows, by raising debt from capital markets to finance climate investment; and mobilizing and 'pooling' concessional flows to support climate investment beyond the MDBs own balance sheets. The note is organized along these two lines, with the aim of providing some insights into the feasibility for MDBs to mobilize resources to leverage a significantly larger volume of climate financing assistance. The next section of this note provides information on how MDBs can support concessional flows to climate investments through pooling of external concessional flows beyond traditional balance-sheet capital. Leveraging shareholder capital and mobilizing and-pooling concessional flows are two potential avenues through which MDBs can leverage and intermediate resources to ultimately increase the volume of climate financing. The experience gained by the MDBs and their clients and donors from implementing these financing arrangements should provide helpful lessons for the development community as it considers how to develop the green climate fund and other future climate change initiatives.";"Basu, Priya

The paper does not cover other financial stability issues that may also be relevant for EMDEs but are addressed in other G20/Financial Stability Board (FSB) work streams. Such issues include the management of sizeable and volatile capital flows; the design of policy measures to address the risks arising from systemically important financial institutions; the development of macro-prudential policy frameworks; the creation of effective resolution tools and regimes for financial institutions; strengthening the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking system; and reforming the functioning of over-the-counter derivatives and commodities markets.

In many instances the disarmament and demobilisation of former combatants was achieved, but reintegration remained a challenge, due to the long-term focus and the substantial resources that are required for such a process to be successful. Reintegration processes are, nonetheless, often implemented in fragile environments, that include fragmented economies, in which most income generating activities are informal or unreported. Such economies are often characterised by unregulated, illicit activities, in which official governance is weak. This report is comprised of three parts. Part one includes a review of the literature on the reintegration of former combatants and the informal economy in Africa; a synopsis of post-conflict economies; and an outline of the analytical framework. Part two presents the findings of the case study research, focusing on the economies and DDR processes in each of the three countries, as well as assessing the reintegration process in relation to the informal economy.

handle:10986/27277;Implementation of Environmental Policies;2010 Environment Strategy;The Bank's environmental agenda has evolved gradually since the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s, the main focus was on mitigating the potential environmental damage associated with investment projects using environmental impact assessments (EIA). This approach was formalized in the Bank's environmental assessment (EA) requirements, which today consist of a set of individual environmental policies and procedures. Recent evaluations of the Bank's safeguards policy implementation reveal that shortages in environmental safeguards specialists and inadequate skills mix, among other factors, are affecting the quality of safeguards implementation. This report recommends strengthening the environmental safeguards career track to help elevate the profile of safeguards specialists and provide opportunities for career advancement in the course of doing safeguards work. The report also recommends that there be an organizational restructuring to enhance the Bank's capabilities for conducting effective safeguards work. Furthermore, the report recommends developing a comprehensive training program that will enhance the safeguards skill mix and increase the effectiveness of safeguards support at the Bank. This report also recommends adopting a categorization methodology that reduces reliance on procedures requiring subjective judgments. Next, the report recommends the creation of a systematic program for measuring, reporting, and evaluating the effects of safeguards implementation. It also recommends a move towards substantive compliance and environmental sustainability principles for the safeguards framework. This report also recommends disseminating knowledge of policy instruments, besides environment impact assessments, that are able to produce similar or better outcomes than the Bank's safeguard policy requirements. The design and implementation of instruments for environmental policy can be pursued with a more risk-based and differentiated approach, based on country or borrower capacity. In addition to the mitigation of negative impacts, this report recommends institutionalizing the enhancement of positive impacts and client capacity building measures into the safeguards framework.;"Triana, Ernesto Sanchez

handle:10986/27308;Development, Climate Change and Human Rights from the Margins to the Mainstream?;;"Since 2005, a growing number of vulnerable communities and nations have used the human rights lexicon to argue their case for an urgent and ambitious response to climate change. The purpose of this Social Development Department Working paper is to examine the emergence of a new discourse linking climate change and human rights, and to assess its social and political implications, particularly as they relate to development practitioners. The scope of this paper is to explore what relevance this new discourse has on what David Kennedy calls the 'vocabularies, expertise, and sensibilities' of development practitioners (Kennedy 2005). The methodology for this paper involved interviews with academics and policy practitioners who have shaped this emerging discourse; a wide-ranging literature review of texts relevant to the fields of development, climate change and human rights; discussions with development professionals who have the daily responsibility of operationalizing approaches to reducing vulnerability and building resilience; and finally drawing upon the author's own experience leading the Maldives' government's initiative on the Human Dimensions of Climate Change and as a consultant within the Social Dimensions of Climate Change Cluster of the World Bank's Social Development Department. It is important to stress that this paper is not a legal piece. Human rights are as much about ethical demands, calls for social justice, public awareness, advocacy, and political action as they are concerned with legal norms and rules. Sen has pointed out a 'theory of human rights cannot be sensibly confined within the juridical model in which it is frequently incarcerated' (Sen 2004, 319). Consequently this piece will focus on the wider, political economy aspects of the interface between human rights and climate change. It is further appropriate to state that this is not an advocacy piece. The paper deliberately avoids being normative or prescriptive in recommending a human rights-based approach to developing climate change operations. It does examine why vulnerable populations chose to embrace this approach, why they continue to view it as a transformative strategy, and what some of the successes and challenges have been.";Cameron, Edward;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-03-31;en;"capacity building;climate change;forest conservation;forestry;indigenous peoples;land use;natural disasters;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27308;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27308/1/691390NWP0P11400Change0Human0Rights.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27308/691390NWP0P11400Change0Human0Rights.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

It also posits that a thriving, legal, private sector is essential to development and peace, as it provides livelihoods and growth, while delivering revenue streams in the form of taxes so governments can provide services to their citizens.

The paper acknowledges that the topic of private sector development cuts across political, governance, and security dimensions, as well as a broad range of development themes. It also considers international efforts to support the private sector in fragile and conflict affected settings to date, identifying gaps and making recommendations to address them.

handle:10986/27324;Democratic Republic of the Congo;Background Case Study;"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been described by one senior African diplomat at the United Nations as a 'state in the making; it is not yet a state.' Further, this 'state in the making' also is a state that, with few exceptions, has been in decline since the early 1970s. The colonial era, from 1885 until 1958, was a period of nearly uninterrupted state construction; the hegemony of the Belgian colonial apparatus steadily deepened. In its final two years, the colonial edifice progressively lost control over civil society to a tumultuous and fragmented nationalist movement, which was unable to capture intact the colonial infrastructure. The result was five years of turbulent state deflation, generally known as the 'Congo crisis.' The Mobutu coup of 1965 inaugurated a new cycle, with eight years in which a rising tide of state ascendancy seemed to dominate the political process. After 1974 currents of decline again began to flow strongly, progressively eroding the superstructure of hegemony. The actual purpose of the Zairian government under Mobutu was not to fulfill basic state functions; rather, the government existed as a structure for individual enrichment and patronage. Officials at the highest levels stole large amounts of money, usually from mineral or customs revenues, sometimes through extremely straightforward strategies, such as literally pocketing gem diamonds and having them sold for personal gain in Antwerp or elsewhere.";Gambino, Tony;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-03-02;en;"corruption;land tenure;rural areas;sustainable development;urban areas";Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;COD";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27324;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27324/1/620290WP0Democ0BOX0361475B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27324/620290WP0Democ0BOX0361475B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27325;Is Reintegration Still Worth Doing Eight Years After the Ceasefire?;Situational Analysis of Ex-Combatants in the Pool Region, Republic of Congo;Although official warfare in the Republic of Congo stopped more than eight years ago, the pool region has continued to feel the collateral effects of war until now at a scale largely ignored by the general public. The pool region is where the Ninjas, a group of local militias, originated during the civil strife and retreated to afterwards. Peace and recovery did not gain traction in the area until 2010/11. Key findings of this analysis of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) process include: The lack of a public security presence: the pool region has largely been deprived of public security forces over the past thirteen years (1998-2010), which led to power abuse. Until recently, several Ninja bases remained throughout the pool region, led by free-riding commanders operating independently of any official Ninja structure. The recognition of intra-regional disparity: warfare affected localities very differently. While the southern districts have been calm for the past eight years, abuse was regularly reported along the railroad prior to 2011. The economic situation of ex-combatants: There have been many self-demobilizations in the past decade, and many ex-combatants have already learned to cope. The heterogeneity of ex-combatants: ex-combatants do not constitute a homogeneous group. Therefore, their reintegration needs differ. The consulting team developed a typology to help understand the profiles of all ex-combatants. Non-targeted assistance: the consulting team recommends pairing recent governmental disarmament operations with community driven reconstruction programming to provide closure to the population affected by the war. The main focus of programming should be to reenergize local economies destroyed by the war, especially medium-scale agriculture and animal husbandry, and to open up the region to development. The objective of this study was to analyze the extent of reintegration of ex-combatants in the pool region and to formulate recommendations for potential future action.;Chelpi-den Hamer, Magali;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"animal husbandry;boundaries;farmers;occupation;rural areas;squatters;youth";Urban Tenure;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;COG";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27325;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27325/1/714130WP0ROC0R07023020120Box370072B.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27325/714130WP0ROC0R07023020120Box370072B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27337;Measures to Reduce the Economic and Social Impact of High Fuel Prices;;High volatility in the world prices of petroleum has been a characteristic feature of the global economy in the last decade. World petroleum prices increased four-fold between 2004 and 2008 and, and following a drop in prices in the second half of 2008, petroleum prices have been rising again, and they are several times higher than they were two decades ago. Since high and volatility of prices is likely to be a permanent feature of the global economy for the foreseeable future, they merit a reconsideration of the national transport and taxation policies that were put in place when fuel prices were not such a significant component of trade-related transactions costs in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. Transport practices that were based on the assumption of low price of fuel are not sustainable, and policies neglect fuel efficiency considerations through lowering the fuel consumption of vehicles measures are no longer sustainable. Efficient and low transport cost is essential to achieve regional economic integration and strengthen Africa's competitiveness in external markets. Higher diesel prices also impact on the prices of all other goods which use diesel as an intermediate input. The most significant among them with implications for the poor in low-income developing countries is food, on which the poor spend a disproportionately high share of their total household expenditures. This report is in three parts in the first part, transport fuel prices in the countries of SSA are compared with those of other regions of the world. The comparison is not only in terms of the actual retail prices but also, but taking account of per capita incomes and truck revenues, also in terms of affordability. This Part also provides evidence of the make-up of transport fuel prices in SSA countries, as a first step in assessing how they can be dealt with. The second part provides new evidence of the impact of these high fuel prices on the export competiveness of a sample of six SSA countries. It also provides a shorter description of the results of a study of the impact of fuel prices on logistics costs in Central America, since so far there have not been any studies of the impact of high transport fuel prices on logistics and food costs in SSA countries. The third part deals with the ways in which the impact of high transport fuel prices can be addressed. Two main areas of action are described, those that would reduce the retail price of transport fuel and those that would increase fuel efficiency, so they impact of high prices would be reduced. This section focuses on diesel fuel, as this is by far the most used by the trucks that transport export products and are involved in domestic logistics. This section concludes with some ideas on what could be done next to make progress on implementing the most promising ideas for reducing the impact of high transport fuel prices.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"agriculture;climate change";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"002;202";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27337;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27337/1/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27337/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27340;Nigeria 2011;An Assessment of the Investment Climate in 26 States;This investment climate analysis reviews the experiences of over 3000 surveyed business owners in 26 states of Nigeria about the aspects of the business climate that affect their businesses. It complements a similar study in 2007 that covered 11 other Nigerian states. The survey asks business owners about both their perceptions and the actual costs of selected constraints. The analysis benchmarks Nigeria against comparator countries, and provides detailed data for each state. Nigerian firms have low productivity, as measured by their output in relation to their labor and capital inputs. Firms in Kenya are about 40 percent more efficient, firms in Russia almost twice as productive, and firms in South Africa almost four times as productive. Nigerian firms that export are about 90 percent more productive than non-exporters. Although labor in Nigeria is inexpensive, it is not inexpensive enough to compensate for this low productivity. The poor performance of Nigerian firms reflects many factors. This study focuses on constraints in the business climate and the serious costs they impose on Nigerian firms. Taken together, the total indirect costs of poor quality infrastructure, crime and security, and corruption amount to over 10 percent of sales for Nigerian firms. This is twice as high as in South Africa, Brazil, Russia and Indonesia. Microenterprises firms with fewer than five workers face similar constraints as larger firm's unreliable power, limited access to finance, corruption, and transportation bottlenecks. But the consequences for their businesses are far more severe. For instance, most microenterprises cannot afford generators, so power outages are more likely to shut down their operation. Lacking collateral, almost no microenterprises have access to formal external financing.;"Iarossi, Giuseppe

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Sub-Saharan Africa expanded by 4.7 percent in 2010, up from 1.7 percent in 2009. In the last five years Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali, ranked in the top ten of 174 of the world s countries in making their regulatory environment more favorable to business. Middle East and North Africa has made impressive gains in women s health and education outcomes. In 2008 the low-and middle income economies of Middle East and North Africa produced 53 percent more energy compared to their 1990 level, but they consumed 133 percent more energy and energy use per capita increased by 63 percent. Economic growth and rising labor productivity has reduced poverty in South Asia, home to half the world s poor people living below $1.25 a day. Information and communications technology services dominate the service exports of South Asia like no other region. Latin American and the Caribbean is the most efficient energy user in the world, measured by the ratio of GDP to energy use. The rapid emergence of East Asia as the world s export powerhouse was complemented by surging final demand within the region, notably in China.

handle:10986/27348;Evaluative Lessons for Agriculture and Agribusiness;;Agricultural investments made by developing countries and multilateral development banks (MDBs) have declined in recent decades. This decline is associated with a slowdown in the growth of agriculture productivity. Most development institutions have recognized the damage caused by this past neglect, in part evident in rising food prices, and renewed attention to agriculture and agribusiness is emerging. But this renewed interest will need to deliver results, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MDBs have had the least success but where the needs and opportunities are enormous. This paper synthesizes recent work by the independent evaluation agency members of the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG) and incorporates lessons from related research by MDBs and from the academic literature on agriculture and agribusiness. The objectives of the paper, in addition to distilling evaluative lessons for agriculture and agribusiness, are to examine the key constraints on the sector and to provide evaluators, operational staff, and policy makers with an evaluative perspective on interventions in countries at different stages of development.;Evaluation Cooperation Group;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-01-31;en;"agriculture;capacity building;climate change;decentralization;deforestation;farmers;farming systems;farmland;food security;forestry;land reform;property rights;rural development;rural population";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;Reports & Research;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27348;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27348/1/653460NWP0ecg00sons0for0Agriculture.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27348/653460NWP0ecg00sons0for0Agriculture.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;Independent Evaluation Group, World Bank ;
handle:10986/27351;Promoting Azerbaijan's Agricultural Productivity (1997-2010);;The objective of this study is to evaluate the World Bank Group's (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], International Development Association [IDA], and International Finance Corporation [IFC]) effectiveness in promoting growth in agricultural productivity in Azerbaijan, and to derive lessons that may be relevant for the World Bank Group's future engagement in Azerbaijani agriculture. The study covers the World Bank's entire agricultural lending and analytical portfolio, and the full period of the Bank's involvement with Azerbaijan's rural sector, commencing in 1997 when the first agricultural project was launched, to 2010. The report begins (section one) with an overview of agriculture's role in Azerbaijan's economy, the strategic need for increased agricultural growth and the technical, economic and policy constraints impeding growth. Section two reviews the Bank's lending program and analytical work, and considers the appropriate balance between lending and analytical activities. Section three assesses the Bank's impact on agricultural productivity, and section four considers how environmental management, social welfare and agricultural growth can be mutually complementary. Section five and six reviews cross-cutting aspects of the Bank's work in Azerbaijan's agriculture sector, including the Bank's effectiveness as an innovator and as a partner with the government in agricultural reform. And section seven assesses the impact of the Bank's own institutional structure and practices on its operational effectiveness promoting agricultural productivity. Concluding the report, Section 8 highlights the main areas where the Bank could have had greater impact on the country's agricultural productivity, and the lessons thereby emerging for the Bank's agricultural role in Azerbaijan in future years.;Oblitas, Keith R.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"agrarian reform;agriculture;corruption;farmers;food security;land administration;land distribution;land ownership;land reform;land registration;land rights;rural areas";Land & Food Security;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150;143;AZE";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27351;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27351/1/653560NWP0Box30anWorkingPaper201103.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27351/653560NWP0Box30anWorkingPaper201103.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27356;Gender and Climate Change;Three Things You Should Know;The World Bank is making strides in mainstreaming gender-sensitive approaches to climate action on the ground. Ensuring that men and women have equal access to education, economic opportunities, productive inputs and equal chances to become socially and politically active can generate broad productivity gains, and lead to more inclusive and greener development path for all. For the World Bank, gender analysis is an integral aspect of the upstream social analysis that is required to inform both development policy lending (DPL) and investment lending (IL). It helps identify and suggest ways to mitigate possible risks in terms of exacerbating gender inequality, and highlight opportunities to enhance positive outcomes for gender equality. The entry points for such upstream gender analysis include Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) in the case of DPL, climate financing mechanisms are beginning to adopt gender-sensitive approaches in program design and results frameworks, but more needs to be done. Much can be done to improve the effectiveness of climate finance and actions on the ground by ensuring that gender relations are taken into account in design, implementation, and measurement of results. But this can only be achieved through a concerted effort to apply a gender lens in climate finance mechanisms. It matters for development, and it matters for effective action on climate change.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"capacity building;climate change;farmers;forestry;land rights;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27356;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27356/1/658420REPLACEM00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27356/658420REPLACEM00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

In terms of construction time, capital outlay and drought resilience, groundwater is the preferred source to meet most water-supply demands, despite hydro geological complexity, natural constraints on water well yields and quality, and institutional weaknesses. The 'new developmental agenda' relates to improving urban water-supply security and expanding irrigated agriculture to meet these challenges many countries need to undertake strategic assessment of their groundwater and prioritize investment on institutional strengthening so as to facilitate appropriately-managed groundwater development. Without effective use of available groundwater resources, improved livelihoods and climate-change adaptation will prove much more difficult to achieve.;"Tuinhof, Albert

handle:10986/27368;Liberia's Cash for Work Temporary Employment Project;Responding to Crisis in Low            Income, Fragile Countries;Together with reductions in indirect taxes on food imports, cash for work programs were one of the main responses implemented by African governments following the food, fuel, and financial crisis of recent years. The main objective of those programs was to help the poor cope with the various shocks by increasing their net earnings through community-level work paid for under the programs. Yet it is unclear whether these cash for work programs indeed reached their intended beneficiaries and to what degree they generated other, potentially long-term beneficial impacts. This paper explores these issues in the context of Liberia and the performance of the Cash for Work Temporary Employment Program (CfWTEP) funded by the World Bank through an emergency crisis facility in response to the 2007/2008 food crisis. Both quantitative and qualitative data are presented, focusing on the operational and policy experiences emerging from program implementation. This paper analyzes the context that led to the creation and implementation of the CfWTEP in Liberia, the nature and administrative arrangements for the program, and its operational performance. The objective is to share the lessons learned from evaluation findings so that they can be useful for implementing similar programs in the future in Liberia itself or in other countries. Findings from the analysis highlight the possibilities of implementing public works program in low capacity, post conflict setting and the scope for using the program as a springboard towards a broader and more comprehensive social safety net.;"Andrews, Colin

handle:10986/27375;Lessons Learned in the Development of Smallholder Private Irrigation for High-Value Crops in West Africa;;The objective of this report is to identify and evaluate best practices in smallholder private irrigation in West Africa. The report is based on a comparative assessment of the smallholder private irrigation subsector in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, which included a literature review, field visits, and workshops at both national and regional levels. The task lists for the assessment is provided in annex one. This report first presents the main features of smallholder irrigation and the development projects that have promoted its use in West Africa in chapter two. The authors then describe the low-cost technologies available for this type of irrigation, including drilling, pumping, and water distribution in chapter three. Chapter four reviews the successes and remaining challenges of the development projects involving smallholder private irrigation in West Africa. Chapter five draws the lessons learned from these experiences and proposes recommendations for future investments, including more support to the development of a supply-chain for low-cost irrigation technologies, the adoption of a programmatic approach, and the necessity for a comprehensive investment package including environmental impact mitigation to sustainably support smallholder irrigators.;"Abric, Stephan

handle:10986/27376;Real Options and Project Evaluation;A Primer;In this paper authors present a preliminary approach to the evaluation of policies and projects based on current thinking on cost benefit analysis and real option methodology and the authors' recent work on the same subject. Authors start from the assumption that economic agents undertake investment projects in order to create and exploit opportunities for increasing profits, growth, wealth and, ultimately, their welfare. These opportunities are options, rights and not obligations to take some action in the future. They include not only projects undertaken, but also projects that could be adopted in the future and opportunities that can be further created or destroyed by this adoption. From the point of view of the welfare of an entire economy, opportunities enlarge the set of actions that may contribute to national wealth. Not only is this increased by the net flow of discounted benefits generated by new ventures, but also by the net value of the options created and destroyed by investment behavior. When companies develop investment opportunities, therefore, they contribute to national welfare in a more subtle, but not less important way, than when they are actively set to exploit some of these opportunities. By recognizing the direct contribution to country wealth of project design and planning, option theory may thus substantially change the theory and practice of decision making about capital investment.;"Knudsen, Odin K.

handle:10986/27377;Does MENA's Governance Lead to Spatial Agglomeration and Disparities?;;In this paper the author analyze the link between spatial agglomeration, spatial disparities and political governance with an emphasis on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The agglomeration index and the urban-rural consumption ratio are used respectively as a measurement of spatial agglomeration and spatial disparities. The author distinguishes two aspects of political governance: political rights and political stability. Statistically, we find that agglomeration rate is higher in MENA, whereas the indexes of political rights and political stability are lower in MENA compared to the rest of the world and other lower middle income countries. When running the regressions, the data better fit the agglomeration model than the urban-rural consumption ratio model. Using cross-sectional data for 182 countries around the world, the author find that the political rights index is negatively and significantly linked to the agglomeration rate. Our results suggest that an improvement in MENA countries' level of political rights to the average of the rest of the world would be associated with agglomeration rate 4 percentage points lower than its average level in the region. The data also reveal an inverted-U relationship between the agglomeration rate and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, and a negative relationship between trade openness and the agglomeration rate.;"Ganiou Mijiyawa, Abdoul

The basic premises of the guide are that resettlement as a preventive measure should be incorporated in comprehensive risk reduction strategies in order to be effective; and that resettlement's objective is to protect the lives and assets of persons at risk and to improve or at least restore their living conditions. The guide has two parts. The first consists of two chapters. The first of these looks at disasters occurring worldwide and their impacts, and discusses strategic frameworks for disaster risk reduction. The second chapter analyzes resettlement as a preventive measure in the context of comprehensive risk management policy. It examines the relevance of resettlement according to the type of natural hazards and to their characteristics, as well as the savings achieved by promoting this type of resettlement rather than handling a disaster generated emergency and recovering from it. In this chapter, preventive resettlement is to be included in the public policy sphere, since it is based on recognition of the rights and responsibilities of public, private, and civil society stakeholders, and is to be guided by principles of effectiveness, equity, and general public well-being.";"Correa, Elena

It also provides a brief profile of the poor. Part two addresses the first strategic component for fostering inclusive growth, which refers to the enhancement of income opportunities and ensuring greater labor mobility for the poor. It begins by reviewing recent economic developments, with particular attention to employment generation, and evaluates the potential of key economic sectors to generate growth and productive employment. Part two then turns to the related challenge of ensuring labor mobility, identifying signs of labor market segmentation and factors that may be responsible for labor market rigidities which inhibit the fluid movement of workers toward the most productive activities. Part three discusses the other main component of fostering inclusive growth, which is to ensure that workers and households are well-equipped to take advantage of productive employment opportunities.

handle:10986/27385;Uganda Dairy Supply Chain Risk Assessment;;Cattle are one of the main instruments for economic (e.g., milk, meat, and cattle sale) and social (e.g., marriage, death, dispute settlement, and gift giving) exchange in Uganda. They serve as the main source of livelihood for a large majority of rural Ugandans, especially in the cattle corridor. Recent statistics demonstrate that the livestock sector contributes 13.1 percent of the agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) and 5 percent of the national GDP. Since 1991, the output of the livestock sector has grown on an average of 2.2 percent per annum, with most of the growth coming from the dairy sector. Dairy is an important and growing sector of Uganda's economy, and it is increasingly proving to be a lucrative livelihood option for a large number of households engaged in milk production and trade. Frequent realization of risks, however, impacts the performance of the supply chain. Effective management of these risks will require increased efforts to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen coping mechanisms. However, rather than a stand-alone risk management strategy, these efforts should be an integral component of a broader dairy development policy and strategy.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-02-28;en;"agriculture;climate change;farming systems;grazing;natural disasters;pastoralists;rural areas;rural development;urban areas";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";Land Use, Management & Investment;"002;UGA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27385;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27385/1/775940WP0Ugand0Box0342041B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27385/775940WP0Ugand0Box0342041B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27393;Climate-Resilient Development in Vietnam;Strategic Directions for the World Bank;Weather is the term used to describe the atmospheric conditions (heat, wetness, wind, etc.) prevailing at any one place and time. Climate is the sum of the prevailing weather conditions of a given place over a period of time, typically summed over many decades. This paper seeks to provide strategic directions for mainstreaming support for climate change within the World Bank's broader program of assistance to Vietnam. It does so by reviewing the current understanding of climate change in Vietnam and likely impacts, outlining principles to guide the Bank's engagement in this field, and applying these principles across a range of sectors, taking into account both near- and longer-term considerations. The report identifies elements of the Bank's current and planned portfolio of projects and analytical work that are contributing or will contribute to improved knowledge, planning, and actions, and it points to additional areas where new or more work seems warranted. The report represents a first iteration of a strategy for supporting Vietnam in managing the challenges posed by climate change. As more experience is gathered and as our understanding of both the science and the economics of climate change impacts in Vietnam improves, this strategy will need to be revisited and refined. While the process of climate change is expected to be a long-term phenomenon-with predictions for considerable changes through the second half of the twenty-first century, the focus of this report is on decisions and priorities that should govern the Bank's assistance during this decade. Given an array of uncertainties, extending the developing assistance planning vision much beyond 2020 is not practical. This time frame also corresponds to the government of Vietnam's own planning horizon.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"agriculture;capacity building;climate change;fisheries;forestry;land area;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;VNM;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27393;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27393/1/677080WP00PUBL0C0Strategy0VN0Final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27393/677080WP00PUBL0C0Strategy0VN0Final.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27395;Increased Productivity and Food Security, Enhanced Resilience and Reduced Carbon Emissions for Sustainable Development;Opportunities and Challenges for a Converging Agenda - Country Examples;The purpose of this paper is to summarize the challenges and the practical successes that a selected number of countries are experiencing in moving towards 'climate-smart' agriculture while also meeting the food requirements of a growing population, broader economic development and green growth objectives. It complements papers prepared in 2010 on technologies and policy instruments, research, and farmers' perspectives. The paper is also intended to provide a broad country perspective to two additional papers produced for a meeting of African Ministers of Agriculture which took place in Johannesburg in September 2011. The main conclusion is that a number of countries have made impressive progress in integrating 'climate-smart agriculture' into broader development and growth programs. Several countries are supporting policy measures and programs to conserve soil and moisture while enhancing productivity and competitiveness, and are addressing the particular concerns of drought-prone semi-arid areas. They are improving agricultural water management and watershed management, and addressing sea-surges, salinity and coastal flooding. Some countries are also including climate-smart agriculture as a core element in broader green growth agendas. The private sector has a key role to play in climate-smart agriculture, especially where the enabling environment has been favorable. Achieving climate-smart agriculture needs an integrated approach, tackling productivity and food security, risk and resilience, and low carbon growth together, but integration and institutional coordination remains a challenge in many countries.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-10-31;en;"agricultural landscape;agriculture;aquaculture;capacity building;climate change;deforestation;farmers;farming systems;farmland;fisheries;food security;forestry;land degradation;land use;rural development;rural population;sustainable development;transaction costs";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"002;143;034;150";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27395;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27395/1/762380WP0Clima00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27395/762380WP0Clima00Box374367B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The specific impacts on each city will depend on the actual changes in climate experienced (for example, higher temperatures or increased rainfall), which will vary from place to place. Climate change will increase the frequency at which some natural hazards occur, especially extreme weather events, and introduce new incremental impacts that are less immediate. However, few climate impacts will be truly unfamiliar to cities. Cities have always lived with natural hazards, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and flooding. In some situations, cities will experience an increase in the frequency of existing climate-related hazards, such as flooding. Climate change considerations can be integrated with disaster risk reduction (DRR) in cities. DRR efforts already familiar to many may be used as a platform from which to develop climate change adaptation plans. In practical terms, disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation can be integrated in many instances, although cities should also consider incremental or gradual changes in climate that affect government operations or community life in less immediate and visible ways than conventional disasters. Approaches to collecting information on climate change impacts in a city can range from highly technical and resource-intensive, to simple and inexpensive. Technically complex assessments are likely to require collaboration with external experts, if a city is not large or well-resourced with sufficient in-house capacity.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"climate change;land degradation;land use";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27396;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27396/1/653590WP0v200B0Urban0Handbook0Final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27396/653590WP0v200B0Urban0Handbook0Final.pdf.jpg?sequence=5&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27399;Unlocking the Public-Private Partnerships Deadlock in Indonesia;;"The challenges faced by Indonesia in creating a robust Public-Private Partnership (PPP) program are similar to those faced by many other middle-income countries. This paper provides a gap analysis for Indonesia's PPP framework based on lessons learned and good practice from countries with successful PPP programs. It identifies, in particular, the need for the government to: select good projects for PPP, rather than only complex ones that are less likely to attract private partners. Establish a list of projects by a limited cabinet meeting and stick to it-issuing different lists of projects and holding showcase summits with open agendas tends to confuse the market. Keep those projects on track for PPP-allowing the contracting agencies to develop prospective projects directly, or to award them without competition leads investors to question the commitment and resolve of the government to its own PPP process. Prepare projects well, using the Ministry of Finance to provide access to: 1) a team of PPP experts to help contracting agencies develop projects; 2) project preparation funding to help pay the high costs of preparation; and 3) viability gap funding to make projects more affordable and bankable by defraying some of the capital costs.";"Wibisono, Andri

handle:10986/27413;The Impacts of Economic Crisis in Mongolia;Findings from Focus Group Discussions;Mongolia was hit hard by the global economic recession, notably the fall in commodity prices. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 1.6 percent in 2009 after growth of 8.9 percent in 2008. The country is narrowly specialized in production of a few primary goods with minerals comprising 70 percent of total exports. Since mid-2008, the prices of main export goods, including copper, zinc, crude petroleum, combed goat-down and cashmere dropped by close to or more than 50 percent, though prices of coal and gold held strong. Furthermore, construction activity fell sharply in 2009 as both the public and private sectors reduced investments and bank loans became less accessible. The research was conducted in urban and rural areas of Mongolia and involved interviews and focus group discussions with about 500 people total (over the four rounds of data collection) belonging to groups identified as particularly exposed to the impacts of the crisis. The primary impacts of the crisis were observed through: 1) labor market effects (e.g. reduced salaries, increased discrimination in the labor market, intensified competition for jobs and a reduction in profitability of small businesses of the poor), 2) price shocks, and 3) social changes (e.g. increase in crime and alcohol abuse). These impacts were particularly significant for the poor.;"Reva, Anna

handle:10986/27417;The Double Burden of Malnutrition;A Review of Global Evidence;"The Double Burden of Malnutrition (DBM) is the coexistence of both under nutrition and over nutrition in the same population across the life course. 'Across the life course' refers to the phenomenon that under nutrition early in life contributes to an increased propensity for over nutrition in adulthood. The DBM affects all countries, rich and poor, and is a particular concern in countries with high stunting rates. The consequences of the DBM are enormous; early life under nutrition is an underlying cause associated with about a third of young child deaths. Among the survivors who become stunted during the first two years of life, their capacity to resist disease, to carry out physical work, to study and progress in school, are all impaired across the life course. Later in the life course, diet and nutrition, and especially obesity, are important underlying causes of many Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and ischemic heart disease. The causes of the DBM are related to a series of changes occurring in the world called the nutrition transition, the demographic transition, and the epidemiological transition of countries. The variables associated with the nutrition transition and obesity epidemic can be grouped into four cross-cutting themes, which include: (i) the health/biological environment; (ii) the economic/food environment; (iii) the physical/built environment; and (iv) the socio/cultural environment. The solutions for the DBM problems are reasonably well recognized in each of its parts: under nutrition and over nutrition. However, the solutions have not been combined into an overarching policy and program framework, which together with raising awareness about the serious future implications for the low-and middle income countries is the aim of this paper.";"Shrimpton, Roger

Nevertheless, for a province that is expected to be a major economic center in the country, there has been very little change in the region's economic structure in the past 10 years. Since 1995, the share of industry and agriculture in the economy is almost unchanged. Furthermore, the growth in both of these two sectors has been low, despite the fact that industry was once the main driver of the East Java economy. This report analyzing the economic conditions of East Java shows that the province offer many economic advantages for investors, such as its geographical location, adequate credit facilities, an abundant and competitively priced workforce, conducive security conditions, and an overall robust macroeconomic condition. The report also finds a number of constraints that, if prioritized and effectively addressed, could boost East java's growth rate to higher level. The main binding constraints to growth in East Java are infrastructure, particularly related to business operations, and the business climate.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-02-28;en;"agriculture;corruption;farmers;land registration;property rights;rural areas;urban areas;urbanization";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27420;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27420/1/609590WP0East010Box358333B01PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27420/609590WP0East010Box358333B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27437;Uganda Water Assistance Strategy;;"Over the past 25 years, Uganda has experienced sustained economic growth, supported by a prudent macroeconomic framework and propelled by consistent policy reforms. Annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 7.4 percent in the 2000s, compared with 6.5 in the 1990s. Economic growth has enabled substantial poverty reduction, with the proportion of people living in poverty more than halving from 56 percent in the 1992 to 23.3 percent in 2009. However, welfare improvements have not been shared equally; there is increasing urban rural inequality and inequality between regions. Revitalizing economic growth and tackling persistent poverty will require addressing a number of challenges. These include alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks; increasing agricultural productivity; managing land, water and other natural resources; addressing demographic challenges; and confronting governance issues. The development and management of water resources is intimately linked to Uganda's continued development ambitions. Water can be both a positive force-providing productive input to agriculture, industry, energy and tourism, and sustaining human and environmental health-as well as a destructive one-to which the devastating consequences of floods and droughts can attest. The National Water Resources Assessment (NWRA) estimates that Uganda's total renewable water resources are about 43 million cubic meters (MCM), less than was estimated in the Ministry of Water and Environment's (MWE's) Sector Investment Plan (SIP) in 2009. About 13 percent of this is sustainable groundwater (5.67 MCM) and the balance is surface water (37.41 MCM). About one half of all districts in Uganda experience annual rainfall deficits-the difference between evapotranspiration and rainfall-ranging from slightly above zero to 400 mm. The frequency of rainfall anomalies below normal (or long-term annual average) is significantly greater than the frequency of rainfall anomalies higher than normal. The Uganda water Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) aims to assist the Government of Uganda (GoU) in identifying priority actions for building on successful outcomes, tackling remaining challenges, and exploiting opportunities in Uganda's water sector. The objective of the water CAS is to define the World Bank's strategic role in supporting GoU to better manage and develop its water resources. The recommendations of the water CAS are complementary to the World Bank Uganda Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2011-15 priorities for Uganda and consistent with the country's development objectives as defined in the National Development Plan (NDP) and water and related sector plans and strategies, which form the foundation of the World Bank Uganda CAS.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-06-30;en;"animal husbandry;capacity building;food security;land use;urban areas;water management;water rights";Land & Food Security;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;UGA";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27437;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27437/1/801720WP00P1180Box0379800B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27437/801720WP00P1180Box0379800B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27438;CDD Initiatives in Mainstreaming Gender in Northeast Brazil;An Exploratory Case Study;The present study focuses on gender while analyzing the effects of the Rural Poverty Reduction Project (RPRP) on the use of time and income generation as well as on cultural and social capital aspects. The study was based on a pilot project in Rio Grande do Norte designed to reinforce actions of the RPRP's focus on gender. The study should be viewed only as an exploratory evaluation that can be indicative of project effects, since the sample used was small and the time span between the subproject's implementation and the collection of impact data was short (only one year). However, other measures in the methodology guarantee a satisfactory minimum level of rigorousness in the evaluation, such as the comparison to a control group taken from a pipeline population of potential beneficiaries and a before-and-after approach to the analysis. The integration of gender concerns into World Bank poverty-reducing programs has been implemented by promoting inclusive development, ensuring that both women and men have a voice in the development of their community and benefit from new development opportunities. Part of this strategy is to advance women's economic empowerment by enhancing their ability to participate in land, labor, financial, and product markets. The current study was conducted simultaneously with the pilot project in order to document its results and, when possible, draw lessons that could be helpful in new operations. The study estimates, on a preliminary basis, how community investments that save women's time in household activities by themselves or combined with investments in production create the enabling environment for women's economic empowerment and, eventually, help reduce poverty.;"Amazonas, Fatima

handle:10986/27439;Planning for Uganda's Urbanization;;Uganda has started its journey into urbanization and economic development. The pace of urbanization is picking up currently at 4.5 percent per year, and likely to accelerate with rising incomes. The economic benefits from urban growth will come from exploiting economies of scale and agglomeration and by increasing fluidity in factor markets that enable substitution between land and non land inputs. Uganda's urban transformation is occurring in a period of particular flux a changing climate is likely to adversely influence rain fed agriculture, which will have bearing on the prospects of small towns that serve as interlocutors with the rural economy. At the other end, closer economic integration in East Africa will increase the reach of the country's largest metropolis, but place it in direct competition with other metropolises in the region. As prices of tradable converge in an open economy, considerable thought and effort will be needed to reduce the prices of non tradable services that can help maintain economic competitiveness. Policymakers both at the national and local levels need to see themselves as change managers who encourage flexibility in how Uganda's towns and cities respond to emerging needs of business and households. Planning ahead is important, but not locking settlements into today's market needs becomes even more important. What are policy priorities to harness economic and social aims from urbanization? This policy note is organized in three sections to answer this question. The first section provides stylized facts on the pace, form and efficiency of Uganda's urban transformation. Section two identifies how land policies, urban planning and transport constraints, and housing shortages are choking urbanization and the economy. Section three lays out a framework for prioritizing and sequencing urbanization policies.

handle:10986/27440;Integrating Leading and Lagging Areas;A Strategy for Making Prosperity for All a Reality;Uganda's fast growth, which has averaged more than 7 percent during the past two decades, has helped reduce poverty the proportion of people living in poverty in the early 1990s has declined to less than half, from 56 percent to 24.5 percent by 2010. However, the reduction in poverty was uneven, and in some cases, poverty increased and inequality persists between and within regions. Partly driven by the uneven reduction in poverty, persistent inequality, and rising unemployment, Ugandan authorities have raised concern about the inclusiveness of Uganda's development. New programs, including prosperity for all, are being undertaken by the government to raise the incomes of households and, hence, close the income gap. Many developing countries are facing the same challenge of reducing spatial differences in living standards. The structural transformation that takes place as countries grow from low to high incomes is accompanied with prosperity in a few places, as has been observed from the history of many developed countries, and is being repeated in many developing ones, such as China, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. This note is organized into six sections. Section two outlines the geography of living standards. Section three describes the transformation that has already happened in the geography of production and how it relates to the geography of living standards. Section four analyzes how the fluidity of two important markets in labor and land should contribute to Uganda's transformation and where the constraints to increased fluidity could be. A strategy for connecting people to prosperity is presented in section five.

The study also examines gender-friendly policies and practices that support these three main goals, which include a wide range of options around laws, regulations, labor policies, gender-sensitive professional development programs, family support mechanisms, women's health programs, and supplier diversity and capacity-building initiatives. This study establishes the business case for investments in women's economic empowerment in SEZs, and identifies good-practice examples of recommended enablers to address this investment opportunity. Enablers are defined as efforts to counteract the negative impact of the obstacles women face in economic participation, and can include policies and programs at the government, zone, and enterprise level. The study provides background, evidence of challenges and success stories, comprehensive recommendations, and a suite of tools and tips to implement the recommendations successfully.";;"World Bank Group;International Finance Cooperation";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"capacity building;land ownership;rural areas";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"KEN;JOR;BGD;PHL;SLV;EGY;CHN;CRI";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27441;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27441/1/727040WP0Box370sez0and0women0global.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27441/727040WP0Box370sez0and0women0global.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27442;Valuation of Ecosystem Services in World Bank Group Work;;"In 2005, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005) provided the first comprehensive report on global ecosystems, the dependence of human societies on the services provided, current state, and likely future trajectory. The MA identified the failure to value ecosystem services as a major contributing cause. The 2001 environment strategy did not explicitly address environmental valuation, although the focus on poverty and environment implies a need for valuing natural resources and environmental services. In consultations on the 2010 environment strategy, a wide range of stakeholders stressed the importance of mainstreaming environmental services. To better direct limited resources for environmental valuation and training, a closer look is needed to identify the conditions under which valuation has had an impact on: policy and project design, policy dialogue in client countries, environmental investments, and strengthening the capacity of national institutions. This report presents a review of environmental valuation in World Bank operational and analytical work, identifying what has been done, and the impacts environmental valuation has had. The report identifies the conditions under which valuation is most likely to influence decision-makers, and finally, the implications for the 2010 environment strategy. The report is organized as follows: section one gives context; section two gives introduction; section three gives approach to learning from past experience; section four focuses on coverage of ecosystem services; section five presents prioritizing environmental valuation; section six deals with why environmental valuation not done; and section seven gives recommendations.";"Lange, Glenn-Marie

handle:10986/27443;Financing Environmental Services in Developing Countries;;Current international financing (primarily ODA) for environmental services in developing countries is very roughly estimated to be upwards of $21 billion annually (not including climate change financing), but additional resources on the order of tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars are needed. In 2009, environmental ODA was estimated at $18 billion with a few billion more delivered through philanthropic and market-based financing channels. Although there are only a few studies of the additional financing needed, and those are relatively narrow in scope, the estimates that are available clearly indicate that significantly higher levels of finance still need to be reached. Additionally, the impacts of environmental finance on environmental sustainability and development objectives are poorly understood. Systematic reviews of previous experience, and standardized monitoring in the future, would support the countries and projects monitored, while also providing important lessons for the broader development and environment communities.;"Sander, Klas

handle:10986/27444;Women, Business and the Law 2012;Removing Barriers to Economic Inclusion;Women, business and the law focuses on this critical piece of the puzzle, objectively highlighting differentiations on the basis of gender in 141 economies around the world, covering six areas: accessing institutions, using property, getting a job, providing incentives to work, building credit and going to court. Women, business and the law describes regional trends and shows how economies are changing across these six areas, tracking governments' actions to expand economic opportunities for women. For men and women throughout the developing world, the chance to start and run a business or get a good job is the surest hope for a way out of poverty. It also requires good business regulation, suited to the purpose, streamlined and accessible, so that the opportunity to build a business or have a good job is dependent not on connections, wealth or power, but on an individual's initiative and ability. The doing business report has led the way in providing data to countries about creating a sounder and more streamlined business environment. Women, Business, and the Law 2012 are the second in this series of reports. This edition retains the same basic structure of the 2010 pilot edition, while significantly expanding the depth of data covered. While the number of topics covered is the same, there has been a significant expansion of the data collected within these topics, thus addressing some of the initial shortcomings of the pilot edition.

handle:10986/27445;Monitoring Environmental Sustainability;Trends, Challenges and the Way Forward;This report presents a concise review of the major environmental and natural resources issues at the global and national level over the coming two decades. The environmental issues reviewed include air pollution and deterioration of air quality, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, water quality, scarcity and access, land and soil degradation, deforestation and forest degradation, natural disaster, loss of biodiversity and protected areas, and governance and institutions for environmental and natural resource management. Besides providing an environment outlook, the report tackles the issue of monitoring also from the supply side. It identifies the relevant data and indicator sets available at the global level and country level to capture the global and locally relevant environmental issues with the underlying objective of pinpointing at data gaps. It concludes with a set of recommendations for moving forward on the monitoring agenda. Overall, the threats from climate change caused by Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, biodiversity loss, water pollution and scarcity as well as pressure on land as well as worsening ocean's state and biodiversity have to be taken under close observation in the period over the next 20 years. The environment challenges that the world faces are not trivial and some of them require immediate action. Action, in turn, requires reliable and accurate information. The second part of the report looks at information from the supply side. It identifies the relevant data and indicator sets available at the global level and country level to capture the global and locally relevant environmental issues with the underlying objective of informing and advising decision making and to identify the data gaps.;Ruta, Giovanni;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-12-09;en;"capacity building;climate change;deforestation;fisheries;forestry;land degradation;land use;sustainable development;urban areas;urban population;urbanization";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27445;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27445/1/810660WP0201010Box0379826B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27445/810660WP0201010Box0379826B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

In line with these objectives, the study assessed the perceived effects and effectiveness of the implementation of the local government reform in selected provinces. The study also constitutes a baseline to allow for on-going assessment of progress and to inform corrective policy actions. The instruments and methods created during the study may be used in future assessments of the dynamics of local governance reform. These effects are reviewed in section two. The study also carried out a rigorous evaluation of the impact of an operational intervention carried out with World Bank support in the three regions of the study. This grant-funded project was aimed at increasing the effectiveness of participation of rural citizens in public life and increasing the capacity of local administrations to operate in the new legal and fiscal environment created by the decentralization reform.

With large structural deficits in the big developed economies, fiscal policy has never been under so much public scrutiny. While there is a clear expectation that economies will need to raise taxes as well as making spending cuts, they will need to remain cautious in how they raise taxes to ensure that recovery is not stifled. For developing economies, with cuts in aid budgets, tax revenues may prove to be a more sustainable source of financing. But challenges remain in terms of combating capital flight.

This paper identifies lessons from the Marketplace and assesses their implications for adaptation support. The findings are based on: statistical tabulation of all proposals; in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of the 346 semi-finalists; and interviews with finalists and assessors. Proposals were fuelled by deep concerns that ongoing climate change and its impacts undermine development and exacerbate poverty, migration and food insecurity. Proposals addressed both local poverty and climate change challenges, and offered a wide range of approaches to render local development more resilient to current climate variability. Therefore, support to community-based adaptation should: exploit its strong local grounding and synergies with development; help connect local initiatives to higher levels; and use complementary approaches to address policy issues.";"Heltberg, Rasmus

handle:10986/27474;Zimbabwe Economic Update, June 2017;The State in the Economy;Zimbabwe’s economy grew by 0.7 percent in 2016 despite the combined effect of the El Nino drought and domestic financial turmoil. The drought reduced agricultural output and increased food prices towards the end of the year, despite the government’s efforts to boost production and stabilize prices. The public provision of agricultural inputs, the creation of food-for-work programs, and the establishment of price supports for staple foods accentuated the government’s expansionary fiscal-policy stance. Meanwhile, the government also increased spending on a cash basis to clear domestic arrears. The authorities financed much of the widening fiscal deficit by issuing Treasury bills purchased by commercial banks and a US$ 1 billion overdrafts with the RBZ. As domestic borrowing reduced liquidity and crowded out credit to the private sector, demand fell, imports contracted sharply, and economic growth slowed. Good rains are projected to boost growth in 2017 but other sectors remain lackluster. To allow GDP growth to recover in 2017 and beyond, the authorities will need to improve public expenditure efficiency and ensure adequate liquidity in the financial sector. The newly introduced command agriculture program provided farmers with inputs which are to be repaid by delivering grain to the Grain Marketing Board at the end of the growing season. These policies are projected to boost agricultural output in 2017. However, government intervention is both expensive and inefficient, especially the use of price support, as floor prices are set far higher than import competing prices.4 Favorable rains during the 2016/17 agricultural season are expected to drive a robust recovery, and the agricultural sector is projected to make a sizeable contribution to GDP growth in 2017. Improving weather conditions will be complemented by the ongoing suspension of import duties on some fertilizer products through end-2017, and by the ongoing allocation of underutilized land managed by the parastatal ARDA and other government agencies to experienced farmers.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-06-21;en;poverty;;;"002;ZWE";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27474;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27474/1/116309-WP-PUBLIC-on-6-21-6-am-dc-time-15-6-2017-15-24-30-ZimbabweEconomicUpdate.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27474/116309-WP-PUBLIC-on-6-21-6-am-dc-time-15-6-2017-15-24-30-ZimbabweEconomicUpdate.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27491;Sustainable Land Management for Mitigation of and Adaptation to Climate Change;;The climate change (CC) caused by increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 and other Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), can be addressed through adaptation and mitigation strategies. Adaptation consists of strategies which minimize vulnerability to CC. The objective is to increase resilience of the ecosystems and communities through adoption of specific sustainable land management (SLM) techniques that have adaptive benefits. On the other hand, the goal of mitigation strategies is to enhance soil and vegetation (land) sinks for absorbing atmospheric CO2 and to minimize net emissions. In the context of the resource-poor and small landholders of the developing countries, adaptation to CC is essential. Adaptation strategies are needed to enhance the positive and reduce the negative effects of CC. Adaptation is also needed because complete mitigation of CC may never occur. The strategy is to adopt those SLM technologies which have both adaptation and mitigation impacts at multiple scales (household, community, and watershed, national, global). There are four major areas in the tropics and sub-tropics where adoption of SLM technologies can help to both adapt to and mitigate CC: (i) tropical forest ecosystems (TFEs), (ii) tropical savannah and rangeland ecosystems (TSREs), (iii) world cropland soils, and (iv) salinized and degraded/desertified lands. Nonetheless, adoption of SLM technologies in the temperate regions (North America, Europe, Australia, Japan) is also important to adapting to CC. However, this report focuses on SLM options for developing countries of the tropics and sub-tropics.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-06-29;en;"agriculture;climate change;deforestation;desertification;farming systems;food security;forest land;forestry;grazing;land area;land degradation;land management;land use";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27491;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27491/1/560620WP0Box341on0612911001PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27491/560620WP0Box341on0612911001PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27504;Justice;Security and Justice Thematic Paper;There is broad recognition, across the political spectrum and in both 'northern' and 'southern' countries, that justice reform, and more generally the promotion of the 'rule of law', are central to development policy, particularly in conflict-affected, fragile and violent contexts. More recently an increased focus on global security and the interaction between security and development as put a renewed emphasis on such efforts. However, while legal, regulatory and 'justice' institutions are now seen as key part of the 'solution' to problems of conflict, fragility and development, this recognition is not matched by a correspondingly clear sense of what should be done, how it should be done, by whom, in what order, or how 'success' may be determined. There often tends to be a clear misunderstanding of both the nature of the problem and (thus) of the solution. In this paper, the author seek to provide some insight into these questions and sketch out a practical conception of effective justice reform in situations of conflict and fragility that may provide the basis for effective programming.;"Desai, Deval

handle:10986/27507;State-Building, Economic Development, and Democracy;The Japanese Experience;The remolding of the state from an autocratic to a democratic one in postwar Japan is sometimes regarded as a successful case of external intervention for state-building. When Americans landed in Japan two weeks after Japan's acceptance of unconditional surrender, they expected to meet a fanatic and intransigent people. Instead they were surprised by the orderly and peaceful behavior of Japanese soldiers and citizens (Tamaki 2005, 13-20). Disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, and reintegration (into their home towns/villages) of millions of soldiers proceeded surprisingly smooth between 1945 and 1948. The authoritarian state gave way to a democratic one within two years of the beginning of the American occupation and democracy has persisted since1. And finally, the Japanese economy had already begun to experience high growth when the occupation ended in April 1952. In every respect, American occupation policies seem to have been successful. Against this image of the American occupation in Japan, this paper will argue that American policies were only partially helpful in the democratic remolding and economic development of postwar Japan. The prewar political and economic experiences of the Japanese themselves, and the psychological impact of the defeat, played equally important roles in the democratic rebirth of the Japanese state. Those in search of solutions to the development challenges facing fragile countries today should understand that Japan's 'success' did not begin in 1945 and was not the result of a peace settlement quickly followed by new institutions. The ground work for Japanese success was 80-90 years in the making. Analysis of state-building, economic development and democracy in Japan must start from the Meiji restoration of 1868.;"Tsunekawa, Keiichi

handle:10986/27537;Assessing the Permanence of Land Use Change Induced by Payments for Environmental Services;Evidence from Nicaragua;There have been few efforts to evaluate whether the positive land use changes induced by conservation interventions such as Payments for Environmental Services (PES) persist once the interventions end. Since gains achieved by conservation interventions may be lost upon termination of the program, even apparently successful interventions may not result in longterm conservation benefits, a problem known as that of permanence. This paper examines the permanence of land use changes induced by a short-term PES program implemented between 2003 and 2008 in Matiguas-Rio Blanco, Nicaragua. This PES program had been found to have a positive and highly significant impact on land use, and particularly on the adoption of silvopastoral practices. To assess the long-term permanence of these changes, participants were re-surveyed in 2012, four years after the last payment was made. We find that the land use changes that had been induced by PES were broadly sustained in intervening years, with minor differences across specific practices and sub-groups of participants. The patterns of change in the period after the PES program was completed help us understand the reasons for the program's success, and rule out alternative explanations for the program's success. Our results suggest that, at least in the case of productive land uses such as silvopastoral practices, PES programs can be effective at encouraging land owners to adopt environmentally beneficial land use practices and that the benefit will persist after payments cease.;"Pagiola, Stefano

handle:10986/27573;A City-Wide Approach to Carbon Finance;;Urbanization and climate change will define much of the 21st century. Urbanization leads to improvement in standards of living, and through the increased density and service delivery efficiency of cities, higher growth can be achieved with lower greenhouse gas emissions. Cities and urban agglomerations house more than 50 percent of the global population and contribute more than 70 percent of Global greenhouse (GHG) emissions. As the share of urban population grows, sustainable urban development emerges as an essential component in addressing climate change. Mitigation often comes at a significant cost. Carbon finance has an important role to play in reducing these costs. Carbon finance is accessible through regulated mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) under the Kyoto Protocol, and through voluntary markets, using the voluntary carbon standard and climate exchanges. City authorities, however, have not been able to fully access market mechanisms for carbon credits.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-12-31;en;"climate change;deforestation;land use;urban forestry";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Training Resources & Tools;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27573;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27573/1/769170AR0Box030bon0finance00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27573/769170AR0Box030bon0finance00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27576;Mongolia;Livestock and Wildlife in the Southern Gobi Region, with Special Attention to Wild Ass;"The purpose of this report is to examine development trends in the Southern Gobi Region (SGR) as they affect livestock and wildlife. It provides an overview of the environment and natural resources of the region, discusses existing relationships and interactions among humans, livestock, large herbivore wildlife, and the natural resources on which they are dependent. It then explores the impact that economic development of the region is likely to have if that development does not consider the needs of the current users. The importance of rangeland and water resources in this region is illustrated by the case study of herder interactions with the Wild Ass or Khulan. This study found that Mongolians in the SGR, especially pastoralists, are interested in wildlife and can be willing cooperators in conservation, especially if they receive some compensation for their efforts. The general conclusion reached by this report is that direct competition for resources is not now the primary issue affecting the relationship between humans, pastoral livestock and large herbivore wildlife; rather it is the lack or loss of a conservation ethic that provides protection for traditional users of natural resources, enforcement of hunting regulations, and prevents illegal sport hunting that is rapidly reducing populations of large wild herbivores in the region. Although economic development of the region will undoubtedly proceed, having in place an effective and functional natural resource management program is critical.";"Sheehy, Dennis

handle:10986/27577;Assessment of Innovative Approaches for Flood Risk Management and Financing in Agriculture;;"Floods are a major source of risk for the agricultural sector. Flood risk in the agricultural sector primarily arises from river flooding, flash floods, and coastal flooding. The impacts of floods can result in sizable agricultural damages at the local level. Floods in agricultural zones expose agricultural producers, agricultural supply chains, rural financial institutions (such as agricultural banks), and governments to financial risks due to the loss of crops, delinquency on seasonal production loans, damage to infrastructure and loss of public revenues. The costs associated with these damages are often absorbed by households directly or governments that provide compensation to agricultural producers in the aftermath of catastrophic flood events. Rural financial institutions also absorb the cost of floods through loan rescheduling or, in catastrophic cases, loan cancellation. In many developing countries, floods are dealt with in a reactive, rather than proactive, manner and little is done to be financially prepared for a catastrophic outcome of floods. Going forward, government and donors can play an important role to facilitate the development of risk spreading mechanisms in general and agricultural flood insurance in particular. First, this includes investment in the generation of public goods to support disaster risk reduction and recovery, risk management, and ultimately insurance applications. Second, awareness building and risk education are essential for better risk management and insurance. In that vein, identifying and assessing flood risk is critical first steps. Third, many of the technologies described here have applications beyond insurance, including for better planning, risk reduction, early warning, and disaster response. Insurance can complement such activities, but is only viable if carried out jointly as part of a broader risk management framework. Fourth, more research and technical assistance is needed to develop simple and financially viable products for flood risk transfer at aggregate levels; there is increasing demand expressed for such products from flood-prone countries. Finally, donors and government can support international and regional centers involved in flood modeling and facilitate a platform that convenes the technical expertise required for flood risk insurance development. Several of such centers and core expertises were identified through this work.";"Lotsch, Alexander

The model is used to analyze the recent dramatic increases in the world price of rice on the regional economy of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese policy response to limit exports. Although results show limited 'pro-poor' outcomes, the CGE model and a micro-simulation (using 2006 VHLSS - Vietnamese Household Living Standard Survey data) show that recent rice export quotas resulted in falls total rural savings as measured by the difference in total income less total production cost and consumption of rice. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section two provides the background and reviews existing studies in Vietnam that have tried to estimate the welfare impact of government policies in rice market. Section three describes the methods and data. The results from the CGE model and micro-simulation on household data are discussed in section four. Section five offer concluding remarks.;"Kompas, Tom

handle:10986/27583;Study on Gender Impacts of Land Titling in Post-Tsunami Aceh, Indonesia;;"The tsunami that originated from the Indian Ocean in 2004 wreaked massive destruction, killing more than 130,000 people and displacing half a million individuals in Aceh, Indonesia. More than 800 kilometers of coastline was affected, and close to 53,795 land parcels were destroyed. The land administration system sustained significant damage because documentation of land ownership was washed away along with people's houses and other possessions in the affected communities. Physical boundary markers, including trees and fences, also disappeared. An additionally, close to one-third of the land office personnel perished. When the disaster struck, Aceh was reeling from three decades of civil strife. Five years later, in 2009, the province was still in the process of recovery not only from the devastation of the tsunami but also from years of unrest. The premise of this research study is that the gender aspects of women's access to land and property rights cannot be understood solely as an administrative or procedural issue, but should be considered a part of the broader social and cultural dimensions. These dimensions need to be understood in relation to development opportunities, constraints, and risks facing women and affecting their ability to participate in the process of reconstruction and development. Understanding the macro social and institutional processes is essential to influencing and supporting changes to enhance gender equity on land and property rights. The results of this study need to be appreciated within the following limitations: (a) it is affected by the absence of baseline information and gender-disaggregated data on land; (b) the scope of this study is limited to land and property rights only; and (c) by the time this study commenced, the Reconstruction of Aceh Land Administration System Project (RALAS) Grant had closed, and therefore the study served mainly to assess and document the experiences and lessons learned.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-12-31;en;"agriculture;decentralization;forest land;forestry;land administration;land improvement;land management;land markets;land reform;land registration;land rights;land speculation;land tenure;land titling;land transactions;land use;land use planning;land valuation;rural areas;rural development;state property;urban areas;urban population;zoning";"Land & Investments;Forest Tenure;Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27583;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27583/1/635270WP0P075001B00PUBLIC00Aceh0web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27583/635270WP0P075001B00PUBLIC00Aceh0web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27584;The Role of Biodiversity and Ecosystems in Sustainable Development;;Biologically diverse ecosystems in countries served by the World Bank provide an array of valuable economic services. While the benefits of conserving ecosystems frequently outweigh the costs, conversion of these ecosystems to other uses occurs anyway, because many ecosystem benefits are of a public good nature, without markets that would reflect their real value. The objective of this paper was defined at a Concept review meeting held on December 2009 and is to increase the understanding on how biodiversity is incorporated in a development agency such as the World Bank Group (WBG) and how the WBG can enhance its role in biodiversity and ecosystems protection and management as a key ingredient to reach development sustainability. In order to define a reasonable strategy to prepare this paper, two approaches were used: the first was to carry out background and analytical studies, and the second was to consult with a wide range of stakeholders including Bank staff, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and indigenous groups. Biodiversity provides many instrumental benefits, from food and fuel to recreation. But even where biodiversity is not immediately instrumental, it represents global public goods that must be protected, if only for their potential value in the future. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has been the mainstay of grants implemented by the Bank ($1.4 billion) for biodiversity conservation and management, but the Bank has itself committed $2 billion in loans and has leveraged $2.9 billion in co-financing.;"Sobrevila, Claudia

Instead, it describes the risks affecting the existing supply chain in terms of their potential impact and prioritizes the risks and areas requiring attention for risk management, investment, and capacity building. The Haitian coffee industry is constrained by significant systemic problems which have contributed to its decline over the years. Some of these major constraints include: (1) the structure of the coffee creole garden which contributes to low on-farm coffee productivity; (2) a land tenure system which inhibits long term investment; (3) poor transportation and logistics infrastructure; (4) limited access to credit and high interest rates; (5) aging coffee trees and farmers; (6) waning government interest and support for the coffee sub-sector; (7) lack of industry level coordination; and (8) a lack of international and domestic promotion of the Haitian coffee industry.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-03-31;en;"agriculture;capacity building;deforestation;farmers;food security;land registration;land rights;property rights;urban areas";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"419;HTI";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27600;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27600/1/756440WP0P117600Coffee0Supply0Final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27600/756440WP0P117600Coffee0Supply0Final.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The research will be repeated on the island of Tanna. To inform the broader context of land leasing in Vanuatu, JBE, in collaboration with the government of Vanuatu, has begun collecting and analyzing government land-leasing data. This process commenced in late 2009 and will ultimately make it possible for leasing patterns in each of the island studies to be placed in a broader national land-leasing context. The JBE Project Framework Document (PFD) for Vanuatu outlines a number of priority research areas in Land and Natural Resource Management (L&NRM) and Access to Justice. The research undertaken on Epi Island during March 2010 investigated the way customary groups negotiate and engage in land-lease dealings and the type and effectiveness of mechanisms and strategies people used to resolve disputes. This approach combined the L&NRM and access to justice research areas in order to: (i) document ways in which customary groups engage with the formal system; and (ii) increase understanding of the type of justice problems citizens face and the mechanisms and strategies people use to enforce their rights. Integrating these two research interests supported a more holistic understanding of the ways in which custom landholder groups operate in the context of legal pluralism.";"Porter, Raewyn

The World Bank Group environment strategy is built on three pillars: leveraging natural resources for growth and poverty reduction; managing the environmental risks to growth and development; and transforming growth paths. As part of its exploration of these three pillars, the strategy considers the question of environmental co-benefits of climate change actions. In particular, it poses the question of potential trade-offs between actions to address climate change and other local and regional environmental priorities, and considers how to maximize co-benefits arising from climate action. The primary objective of this background paper is to assess the potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation actions to provide environmental co-benefits, particularly in the quality of environmental media, flow of ecosystem services, and maintenance of biodiversity. To accomplish this, the paper is organized in five sections: section one gives provision of an organizing framework to identify and classify potential co-benefits; section two gives summary of the external literature on co-benefits; section three gives review of examples from the World Bank portfolio; section four presents initial thoughts on creation of enabling conditions for co-benefit provision; and section five gives review of implications for the environment strategy.";"Hamilton, Kirk

handle:10986/27622;The Effect of Local Governance on Firm Productivity and Resource Allocation;Evidence from Vietnam;Governance quality plays a key role in private sector development: competent bureaucrats not only create good policies and regulations, but also effectively implement them to shape the business environment. This paper exploit Vietnam’s decentralization of administrative tasks since the early 2000s to test this hypothesis. The paper examines how changes in the provincial administration of national business regulations affect firms through two channels: within-firm productivity levels and resource allocation across firms. The results show that better overall business environment has a positive impact on firm productivity, and this effect is driven by a reduction in corruption levels, the risks of land expropriation, and entry regulations. The analysis also finds that high-productivity firms are generally better able to take advantage of improvements in the business environment. However, better implementation of entry regulations matters most for less productive firms. The study does not find evidence for the impact of business environment quality on province-level market efficiency.;"Tan, Shawn W.

handle:10986/27630;Farm Size and Productivity;"A Direct-Inverse-Direct"" Relationship""";"This paper proposes a new interpretation of the farm size-productivity relationship. Using two rounds of the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey, and drawing on earlier work on five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper shows that the relationship between farm size and productivity is neither monotonic nor univocal. Most previous studies that tested the inverse farm size-productivity relationship used ordinary least squares estimation, therefore reporting parameter estimates at the conditional mean of productivity. By expanding these important findings to consider the entire distribution of agricultural productivity, the analysis finds sign switches across the distribution, pointing to a “direct-inverse-direct” relationship. Less productive farmers exhibit an inverted U-shape relationship between land productivity and farm size, while more productive farmers show a U-shape relationship that reverses the relationship. In both cases, the relationship points toward a threshold value of farm size; however, the threshold is a minimum for the less productive farmers and a maximum for the more productive ones. To the left of the threshold, for very small farmers, the relationship between productivity and farm size is positive; for the range of middle farm size, the relationship is negative; and to the right of the threshold, the relationship is direct (positive) again. From a policy perspective, these findings imply that efficiency-enhancing and redistributive land reform should consider farm size in the proper context of the present and potential levels of agricultural productivity. The results and their policy implications underline the relevance of the most recent efforts of the international development community to collect more reliable georeferenced data on farm size and agricultural productivity.";"Savastano, Sara

handle:10986/27638;Land Productivity and Plot Size;Is Measurement Error Driving the Inverse Relationship?;This paper revisits the decades-old puzzle of the inverse plot-size productivity relationship, which states that land productivity decreases as plot size increases. Existing empirical studies on the inverse plot-size productivity relationship define land productivity or yields as self-reported production divided by plot size. This paper considers an alternative approach to estimating yields based on crop cuts. The crop-cut method entails measuring and harvesting randomly selected subplots by trained technicians, and is recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization for the accurate measurement of crop production. Using data representative of rural Ethiopia, the analysis indicates that the inverse relationship is strong when based on self-reported production, but disappears when based on crop-cut estimates. The inference from these findings is that the inverse relationship is an artifact of systematic overreporting of production by farmers on small plots, and underreporting on larger plots. The paper also discusses how rejecting the inverse plot-size productivity relationship has significant implications for the inverse farm-size productivity relationship.;"Desiere, Sam

handle:10986/27641;Mission Impossible?;Exploring the Promise of Multiple Imputation for Predicting Missing GPS-Based Land Area Measures in Household Surveys;"Research has provided robust evidence for the use of GPS technology to be the scalable gold standard in land area measurement in household surveys. Nonetheless, facing budget constraints, survey agencies often seek to measure with GPS only plots within a given radius of dwelling locations. Subsequently, it is common for significant shares of plots not to be measured, and research has highlighted the selection biases resulting from using incomplete data. This study relies on nationally-representative, multi-topic household survey data from Malawi and Ethiopia that exhibit near-negligible missingness in GPS-based plot areas, and validates the accuracy of a multiple imputation model for predicting missing GPS-based plot areas in household surveys. The analysis (i) randomly creates missingness among plots beyond two operationally relevant distance measures from the dwelling locations; (ii) conducts multiple imputation under each distance scenario for each artificially created data set; and (iii) compares the distributions of the imputed plot-level outcomes, namely, area and agricultural productivity, with the known distributions. In Malawi, multiple imputation can produce imputed yields that are statistically undistinguishable from the true distributions with up to 82 percent missingness in plot areas that are further than 1 kilometer from the dwelling location. The comparable figure in Ethiopia is 56 percent. These rates correspond to overall rates of missingness of 23 percent in Malawi and 13 percent in Ethiopia. The study highlights the promise of multiple imputation for reliably predicting missing GPS-based plot areas, and provides recommendations for optimizing fieldwork activities to capture the minimum required data.";"Kilic, Talip

handle:10986/27667;Philippines Urbanization Review;Fostering Competitive, Sustainable and Inclusive Cities;"Urbanization is a driving force for growth and poverty reduction. Globally, over 80 percent of economic activity is concentrated in cities, and cities are essential for lifting millions of people out of poverty through the opportunities that density and agglomeration can bring with jobs, services, and innovation. However, if not carefully managed and planned for, the benefits of urbanization are not realized and can result in congestion, slums, pollution, inequality and crime. City competitiveness is an important part of successful urbanization. A competitive city facilitates its firms and industries to create jobs, raise productivity, and increase the incomes of citizens over time. At the same time, it is not possible to achieve these objectives without strong institutions, social inclusion, resilience, and environmental sustainability. All of these elements are important to harnessing the benefits of urbanization and must be enabled by both national and local governments. Chapter one of the report provides an introduction to urbanization in the Philippines. Chapter two covers analysis of urbanization and growth in the Philippines, Chapter three focuses on city competitiveness for economic development and job creation, chapter four provides an analysis of urban poverty with a particularly focus on informal settler families (ISFs) in Metro Manila, chapter five outlines the key binding constraints related to institutions for urban development and metropolitan governance; and chapter six covers constraints related to land administration and management in urban areas. Each chapter includes a framework for analysis, identification and assessment of key issues, and provides recommendations for the Government of the Philippines to consider. Important topics related to environmental sustainability and resilience are included as a cross cutting issue as they relate to urban planning and land management, but not covered in depth as they have been addressed in other World Bank reports. The full study is summarized below. Background technical papers for each section have also been prepared and cover much more analysis and detail.

handle:10986/27682;Managing Forest Ecosystem Services for Hydropower Production;;In many countries, hydropower development is rapidly becoming a focus of green growth policies. This represents a significant opportunity for ecosystem services-based land management that integrates environmental and development goals to benefit the hydropower sector and support economic growth. In this study, we present an approach for targeting ecosystem-provision investment in hydropower catchments coupled with hydrologic modeling to quantify the benefits of soil and water conservation activities. We demonstrate the application of this approach in five hydropower facility catchments in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. The results show that there is a high potential for targeted soil and water conservation to increase sediment retention services that benefit hydropower facilities (up to a 44% reduction in sediment transported from uplands into streams), although this benefit is distributed non-uniformly across catchments and levels of investment. The extent to which services can be improved is strongly driven by current land use and management practices that impact how and where conservation activities can be located. Iterative use of the method described here, in a process of stakeholder engagement and capacity-building, enables policy makers to determine the optimal mix of land management strategies and budget allocation to maximize service improvements that support hydropower production.;"Vogt, Adrian L.

handle:10986/27723;Logistics Competencies, Skills, and Training;A Global Overview;"Despite the spread of automation and new supply chain management paradigms, logistics remains dependent on a rather specific set of skills and competencies, whether for managerial, administrative, or blue-collar jobs, such as trucking or warehousing. This dependence implies that the logistical performance of businesses, industries, and nation states is strongly influenced by the quantity and quality of the workforce. Insufficient resources of a competent and properly trained workforce in logistics adversely affect the quality of service, reduce productivity in sectors dependent on logistics, and ultimately reduce trade competitiveness. While other interventions that affect logistics performance—such as international infrastructures, trade corridors, regulations, and services—have already been reviewed extensively, this report is the first to cover the contributions of human resources and explore how to develop skills and improve competencies, especially in developing countries. The study proposes a framework for the skills needed according to the logistics activity (such as transportation or warehousing) or the type and level of responsibility. Based on several sources, including recent surveys carried out by the World Bank and the Kühne Logistics University, the report uncovers where the skills constraints are according to the type of job or countries. Findings include that logistics is an industry struggling to hire skilled workers, although with differences between developed countries (where trucker shortages are more acute) and developing economies (where managerial shortages are more widespread). Typically, blue-collar logistics jobs have lower status and lower pay than blue-collar jobs in other industries; they are thus less attractive for skilled workers. In developing countries with a potentially available workforce, lack of vocational preparation for careers in logistics means that less-skilled workers are not easily re-skilled. Logistics tasks at the upper end of the occupational hierarchy and those with high information technology content often require an upskilling of employees to keep pace with new technology. Yet the problem is not confined to recruitment. The surveys point to limited resources, money, and staff time allocated to training, especially in developing countries. Realizing the promise of quality jobs from the growth of logistics worldwide requires a coordinated effort by logistics companies, professional associations, training providers, and policy makers. Through a combination of facilitation, regulation, advice, financial instruments, and land use planning, governments can exert significant influence.";"McKinnon, Alan

handle:10986/27728;Poverty Dynamics in Vietnam, 2002-2006;;This paper provides a descriptive and multivariate analysis of poverty dynamics in Vietnam using panel data from the Vietnam household living standards surveys of 2002, 2004, and 2006. Transition matrices and contour plots confirm that while large numbers of households moved out of poverty between these years, many did not move far the poverty line and that around a tenth of rural households appear to be trapped in chronic poverty. Different categorical models are then estimated to analyze the correlates of chronic poverty and the drivers of poverty transitions in rural areas. Initial conditions, such as household size and composition, whether the household head comes from an ethnic minority or failed to complete primary school, and residence in northern Vietnam, have important roles in trapping households in poverty. Simultaneous quintile regression models show the chronically poor are more disadvantaged by geography and ethnic minority status, while changes in household size and the share of children matter more to the living standards of the never poor.;"Baulch, Bob

The report benefited from advice, ideas, and information about tigers and tiger-friendly infrastructure development from staff at the World Bank, and from several institutions that promote tiger and biodiversity conservation throughout the world. This study addresses infrastructure's impacts on tigers at international, national, sectoral and project levels in combination with the mitigation hierarchy which is based on avoidance, mitigation, minimization and compensation of impacts. It examines infrastructure policy challenges and opportunities, using lessons learned from case studies, along with regional and in-country analyses. While there are opportunities for improvement in all countries, Russia, India, Bhutan, and Nepal has, in particular, developed good foundations for tiger-related conservation, planning, and policy efforts. Best practices, drawn from case studies in non-tiger range countries, provide additional insights into infrastructure practices that could benefit tiger populations. Avoiding Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs) is the best and cheapest option available to all parties for saving wild tigers.;"Quintero, Juan D.

handle:10986/27752;Economic Evaluation of Climate Change Adaptation Projects;Approaches for the Agricultural Sector and Beyond;This paper identifies key challenges and solutions for carrying out project-level economic analysis of adaptation to climate change, both stand-alone and integrated into broader development projects. Very few projects addressing adaptation thus far have been subject to in-depth and rigorous economic analysis for a variety of reasons, including a lack of guidance on how to deal with assessments of the impacts of climate change, as well as with estimating costs and benefits of adaptation under uncertainty. The paper focus is on the agricultural sector, where the impacts of climate change have the potential to disrupt the livelihoods of rural populations in many regions and where adaptation must be given urgent consideration. Nevertheless, some of the approaches discussed are suitable to projects in other sectors as well. Finally, robust decision making (RDM) can provide an alternative quantitative decision analytic method that avoids subjective probability assessments and scenario predictions. RDM creates hundreds or thousands of plausible futures, in the judgment of the analyst, that are then used to systematically evaluate the performance of alternative actions. This approach facilitates identifying the set of conditions under which any particular alternative adaptation performs well or poorly, according to various evaluation criteria based on the decision maker's judgment. The decision maker can identify 'robust' alternatives that, compared to other alternatives, perform reasonably well across a wide range of plausible futures.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-12-31;en;land degradation;Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27752;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27752/1/554700WP0D1CC010Box349454B01PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27752/554700WP0D1CC010Box349454B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/27755;Impacts of Transmission and Distribution Projects on Greenhouse Gas Emissions;Review of Methodologies and a Proposed Approach in the Context of World Bank Lending Operations;The Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change (SFDCC) approved in 2008 guides and supports the operational response of the World Bank Group (WBG) to new development challenges posed by climate change. One activity pursued by the SFDCC is to further develop and test methods to analyze climate risks and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the project level. The SFDCC emphasizes the need to improve GHG accounting activities at the project level to understand the implications of the World Bank's interventions. The objective of this study is to contribute to the SFDCC goal of improving GHG accounting in the energy sector by reviewing, assessing, and recommending GHG accounting methodologies for electricity Transmission and Distribution (T&D) projects. Existing methodologies are examined to test whether they can provide simple and accurate estimates of net project emissions. In addition, the study identifies and conceptually designs a methodological approach for T&D projects. The study focuses on the T&D sector due to its importance in the World Bank's energy lending portfolio and the lack of comprehensive methodologies to determine the impact of such interventions on GHG emissions. The study builds on existing information and relies on methodologies developed under different climate finance mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The study also considers some of the fundamental principles in other accounting procedures, such as corporate GHG accounting. Methodologies that have the objective of emissions accounting for climate finance mechanisms need to have specific characteristics, such as additionality and ex post monitoring. These methodologies must calculate a project's emissions reductions or increases by estimating the project's net emissions impact.;"Madrigal, Marcelino

handle:10986/27759;The Democratic Republic of Congo's Infrastructure;A Continental Perspective;The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD) has gathered and analyzed extensive data on infrastructure in around 40 Sub-Saharan countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The results have been presented in reports covering different areas of infrastructure ICT, irrigation, power, transport, water and sanitation and different policy areas, including investment needs, fiscal costs, and sector performance. This report presents the key AICD findings for the DRC, allowing the country's infrastructure situation to be benchmarked against that of its African peers. Given that the DRC is a fragile state trying to catch up with other low-income countries (LICs) in the region, both fragile-state and LIC African benchmarks will be used to evaluate the DRC's situation. Detailed comparisons will also be made with immediate regional neighbors in Central Africa. Several methodological issues should be borne in mind. First, because of the cross-country nature of data collection, a time lag is inevitable. The period covered by the AICD runs from 2001 to 2006. Most technical data presented are for 2006 (or the most recent year available), while financial data are typically averaged over the available period to smooth out the effect of short-term fluctuations. Second, in order to make comparisons across countries, indicators had to be standardized to place the analysis on a consistent basis. This means that some of the indicators presented here may be slightly different from those that are routinely reported and discussed at the country level. During the period from 2001 to 2005, per capita economic growth in DRC was on average 2.1 percent higher than during the period from 1991 to 1995. Despite this improvement, growth levels, which oscillated between 4 and 8 percent in the early 2000s, still fell short of the sustained 7 percent per year needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Improved telecommunications infrastructure has been the main driver of this change, contributing 1.1 percentage points to the country's per capita growth rate. Deficiencies in power infrastructure, on the other hand, held back per capita growth by 0.25 percentage point over this period.;"Foster, Vivien

handle:10986/27777;Russian Economic Report, No. 22, June 2010;A Bumpy Recovery;Amid heightened global uncertainties, Russia is experiencing a bumpy recovery. Domestic demand is rising, but unemployment remains high, and credit and investment remain limited. The budget has benefited from higher oil prices, but fiscal consolidation remains important in the medium term. Crumbling infrastructure, especially in transport, could hamper the economy's competitiveness and longer-term growth prospects. The debt crisis in Western Europe sharpens the downside risks to global recovery and oil prices. But the effects on Russia are likely to be blunted by its stronger fiscal and debt positions and by limited trade and financial links with the affected countries. Russia is likely to grow by 4.5 percent in 2010, followed by 4.8 percent in 2011, as domestic demand expands in line with gradual improvements in the labor and credit markets.

handle:10986/27780;Indonesia Economic Quarterly, December 2010;Maximizing Opportunities, Managing Risks;The Indonesian economic quarterly reports on and synthesizes the past three months' key developments in Indonesia's economy. Its coverage ranges from the macro economy to financial markets to indicators of human welfare and development. It is intended for a wide audience, including policy makers, business leaders, and financial market participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia's evolving economy. The challenge for Indonesia is to maximize the opportunities that this brings, in terms of enhancing future growth and making investments that can improve the welfare of the entire population, while managing the associated risks. Strong capital inflows, particularly portfolio, have been seen across emerging markets, including Indonesia. These inflows are driven by yield differentials and the stronger growth prospects, and improved creditworthiness, of emerging economies relative to heavily indebted, higher-income economies. Further quantitative easing in the US has provided an additional, cyclical boost to this trend. Global commodity prices also picked up in recent months. In November, the US dollar price of non-energy commodities rose by 3.4 percent over the month with food and raw material prices up by 4.9 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. The underlying drivers were strong growth in demand from emerging economies, particularly China, and also supply disruptions in the agriculture sector.;;World Bank Group;Jakarta;World Bank Group;2010-12-31;en;"natural disasters;property rights;urbanization";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27780;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27780/1/584580WP0indon101B01PUBLIC10english.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27780/584580WP0indon101B01PUBLIC10english.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27787;Sector Licensing Studies;Mining Sector;This report is intended to provide guidance on best practices in mining licensing, based on examples from low, middle and high income countries in Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. It is not a 'how-to guide' or a licensing implementation toolkit, but rather identifies certain common features of successful mining licensing regimes worldwide that other national or sub-national jurisdictions might usefully incorporate in new mining laws and regulations or revisions or existing ones. The case studies and other examples of good and bad practice are intended to provide a cross-section by geography and by income level, and they demonstrate that the prevalence of good and bad practices is not simply a function of income level. Tanzania, one of the poorest countries in the world, has in many respects a better licensing regime than either South Africa or the U.S. State of Wisconsin. In considering these complex issues, it has proven difficult to confine the discussion purely to questions of licensing. Discussion of licensing invariably invokes reference to overall policy and investment climate issues, environmental protection, labor law, taxation, national and sub-national jurisdiction, land tenure, and much more. This report makes no attempt to address all of these in detail but refers to them in reference to their interactions with and effect on, licensing itself. Far more detailed research on mineral policy, taxation, investment climate, and other issues has been carried out, some of it referred to in this report and cited in the footnotes and bibliography.;;International Finance Cooperation;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"extractive industries;forestry;land use;land use planning;property rights;sustainable development";"Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27787;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27787/1/587890WP0Secto1BOX353819B001PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27787/587890WP0Secto1BOX353819B001PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY-NC-ND;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27794;Impact Evaluations in Agriculture;An Assessment of the Evidence;"This report seizes the opportunity to learn from existing evidence by analyzing lessons derived from impact evaluations produced between 2000 and January 2009 to begin to discern what has been effective in agriculture. It is part of a broader effort being undertaken by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank to understand how impact evaluations can help improve performance and broadly disseminate those lessons. Specifically, the report has three objectives: 1) assess the current state of impact evaluations in the agriculture sector and highlight challenges that users face when trying to answer what works best in the sector; 2) derive a taxonomy of agriculture interventions evaluated using impact evaluation methodology, and identify the most common constraints for farmers and addressed by those interventions; and 3) highlight what can be said about the impact of different interventions on agricultural outcomes (focusing on productivity and farm income). Also, point to areas for future research of agricultural interventions to broaden the use of this analysis. The rest of this chapter provides some necessary definitions for the report, outlines the conceptual framework, and presents a brief background on the selection of impact evaluations (IEs) from the evaluation literature. Chapter two provides a profile of the evidence, including IE characteristics and challenges encountered in the analysis. Chapter three looks within the interventions and presents a formal taxonomy of all agricultural interventions represented in the group analyzed for the report. Chapter four delves into the evidence by presenting the primary constraints dealt with in the interventions, the results reported by the evaluations, and some lessons that may be incorporated into future project design. Chapter five concludes with some general remarks.";;The Independent Evaluation Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"agriculture;aquaculture;decentralization;farmers;land ownership;land reform;land tenure;rural development";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Journal Articles & Books;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27794;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27794/1/726930WP0Box370ment0of0the0Evidence.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27794/726930WP0Box370ment0of0the0Evidence.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27797;Performance of Transport Corridors in Central and South Asia;Measurements 2008-2009;This study is part of the ongoing dialogue on reforming trade logistics, and facilitating trade and transportation in Central and South Asian countries. It presents key findings from several rounds of first-hand observations and interviews conducted with multiple stakeholders to measure the performance of key road transport corridors across the region, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and to some extent, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The study identifies obstacles that hinder efficient movement of goods along transport corridors, and offers recommendations for short- and medium-term reforms for participating country governments with particular emphasis on the performance of border crossings. The overall objective of this study is to provide basic information on transport corridor performance so that national policy makers and private sectors have a basis to open discussions on how they might cooperate to facilitate international trade and transport by addressing infrastructure and operational bottlenecks in the region.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-05-31;en;;;;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27797;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27797/1/669430BR0Draft0official0use0only090.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27797/669430BR0Draft0official0use0only090.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27805;Costing Adaptations through Local Institutions;Village Survey Results - Yemen;"The objectives of the Costing Adaptation through Local Institutions (CALI) study were (a) to identify the costs of adaptation through local institutions, and (b) to investigate which institutions help households adapt to climate variability, which efforts and costs are needed to realize the adaptation options, and how they facilitate adaptation to climate variability. The study was carried out in Ethiopia, Mali, and Yemen. This report discusses the results for Yemen. In Yemen, village surveys were conducted in six villages and two expert workshops were organized to discuss the main framework of the study and to evaluate the draft results. The study assessed household vulnerability, analyzed the strategies households adopt to reduce the impacts of climate hazards, and evaluated the assistance households receive from different institutions. The analysis was based on household surveys, focus group discussions, and institutional stakeholder interviews. Vulnerability profiles, developed on the basis of field survey results, show that household vulnerability differs substantially between and within villages. The results show that the vulnerability and agro ecological potential in Yemen are related to rainfall, which is related to altitude. This study is a reflection of the insights that (a) poor, rural households are facing most of the climate variability- related hazards; (b) adaptation also has socioeconomic aspects; (c) understanding local adaptation processes is important for informing macro-policies; and (d) for prioritizing future adaptation, it is crucial to analyze historical adaptation strategies. The study involves an assessment of the adaptation options rural household pursue. The study also considers the differential access of various vulnerability groups, as well as the drivers for adopting particular strategies or constraints for not adopting other strategies. For this, households and institutional stakeholders were interviewed in six villages in Yemen, focus group discussions were organized, and experts were consulted.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-02-28;en;"climate change;desertification;food security;land degradation;land use;natural disasters;rural areas;urban areas;water management";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;"145;YEM;015";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27805;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27805/1/6656100PUBLIC00B0WP0CALI0Yemen0Web2.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27805/6656100PUBLIC00B0WP0CALI0Yemen0Web2.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

The size and diversity of income and the ability to flexibly decide on alternative measures to mitigate the adverse climate effects, which depends on, for example, level of education and dependency ratio, have effects on the adaptation options households adopt and the type of institutional assistance they receive. This report presents the results of the World Bank-funded project on Costing Adaptation through Local Institutions (CALI). The objectives of the CALI-project are: (1) to identify the costs of adaptation through local institutions, and (2) to investigate the institutions that support households in adapting to climate variability, the efforts and costs required to realize the adaptation options, and how they facilitate adaptation to climate variability.

handle:10986/27812;High-Speed Rail;The Fast Track to Economic Development?;"A high-speed rail service can deliver competitive advantage over airlines for journeys of up to about 3 hours or 750 km, particularly between city pairs where airports are located far from city centres. One suitable type of corridor is that which connects two large cities 250-500 km apart. But another promising situation is a longer corridor that has very large urban centres located, say, every 150-300 km apart. On these longer corridors, typical of some being built in China, high-speed rail has the ability to serve multiple city-pairs, both direct and overlapping. The overall financial performance of high-speed train services depends on enough people being able to pay a premium to use them. In Japan there is a surcharge for high-speed rail which doubles the fare on conventional services. China high-speed train fares are about three times conventional train fares. But in order to generate the required volume of passengers it will usually be necessary not only to target the most affluent travelers but also to adopt a fare structure that is affordable for the middle income population and, if any spare capacity still exists, to offer discount tickets with restrictions on use and availability that can fill otherwise unused seats. The combination of supportive features that exist on the eastern plains of China including very high population density, rapidly growing disposable incomes, and the prevalence of many large cities in reasonable proximity to one another (creating not just one city-pair but a string of such pairs) are not found in most developing countries. Nor could all countries assemble the focused collective capacity building effort and the economies of scale in construction costs that arise when a government can commit the country, politically and economically, to a decades-long program over a vast land area. Even in China, the sustainability of railway debt arising from the program as it proceeds will need to be closely monitored and payback periods will not be short, as they cannot be for such ""lumpy"" and long-lived assets. But a combination of those factors that create favorable conditions of both demand and supply comes together in China in a way that is distinctly favorable to delivering a successful high-speed rail system.";"Amos, Paul

handle:10986/27813;Freight Transport for Development Toolkit;Ports and Waterborne Freight;"The estimate of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is that more than 80 percent or close to 8 million tons in 2007, of world freight is transported by sea. Most, if not all, freight transport moves from the producer to the consumer through logistic processes thereby passing a number of nodal points. As for waterborne transport, sea and river ports and terminals form these nodal points where freight is transferred from one mode to another. Chapter one provides data on world maritime transport and explains the different types of cargo that pass which are carried by the world merchant fleet and the cargoes they carry. It also is explained that the former general cargo type of vessels have evolved into vessel designs that have specifically been designed for different types of cargoes. Chapter two provides an extensive overview of the development of the container in terms of what containers are, how dedicated container vessels have developed as well as the impact of containers on logistic processes, including hinterland connections. Chapter three provides an overview of the world port in terms of numbers and classifies the largest ports in the world in terms of total cargoes, containers and dry bulk. Chapter four presents an overview of the indicators used in ports. Chapter five describes how ports around the world are owned and managed. First the major characteristics and functions of ports are described and possible ownership structures are explained. The chapter six not only describes the aspect of emissions, but also describes other forms of pollution sources of the sector, as these are noise, light, dust and soil and water pollution. As is explained in chapter seven, port work has gradually changed from pure physical work to processing control using dedicated and complicated equipment and automated systems. Similarly, the work of seafarers has changed. Chapter eight provides tools as to how cities can cope with this issue; in particular how former port areas can be and have been re-integrated in the city. Chapter nine presents a number of examples comparing rates that were charged in 2008 with those in the same period in 2009. Finally, chapter ten provides a comparison between the World Bank's transport business strategy paper 2008-2012 and the issues presented in this overview of ports and waterborne transport.";"Kruk, C.

handle:10986/27815;Institutional Development and Good Governance in the Highway Sector;Learning from Gujarat;The World Bank financed the Gujarat State Highway Project (GSHP) during 2001-07. The project development objective was to enhance the capacity of the Government of Gujarat (GOG) for effective and efficient planning and management of road infrastructure, while concurrently maximizing existing road infrastructure asset productivity through priority investments and increased maintenance funding. The project not only achieved its objective and targets successfully, but also was implemented with a significant cost reduction (about 23 percent). The GSHP resulted in a reduction in the backlog of major maintenance and an improved network to meet rapidly growing transport demand in the state. The project had the unique distinction of no contract disputes, a rarity among the highway development projects in India. The project also set best practices in developing and managing a very comprehensive asset management system, state of the art quality assurance framework and a very comprehensive training and capacity building program. The annual road sector allocation has grown from USD 30 million in 1995-1996 to an impressive USD 610 million in 2010-11, currently the second largest among all the Indian states. This study attempts to identify the key elements of the Gujarat road sector reforms and explores whether and, if so, how such reforms can be replicated across other Indian states and possibly even in other countries in the region.;"Bandyopadhyay, Arnab

handle:10986/27836;Poverty and Inequality Changes in Turkey (2003-2006);;Poverty in Turkey has declined significantly between 2003 and 2006, as a result of rapid poverty reduction in urban areas. In the same time period, the reduction in poverty in rural areas has been slow or non-existent. As a result, the relative risk of poverty has increased in this time period for those employed in agricultural sector, living in rural areas and in large households. Inequality in urban areas has decreased as a result of high growth in the consumption levels of the urban poor compared to richer deciles, while no significant changes to inequality measures have been noted in rural areas. In fact, the consumption levels of poorest groups in rural Turkey have declined between 2003 and 2006. Child poverty has also been persistent in this time period, with the relative risk of poverty for children (ages0-19) increasing over time.;"Aran, Meltum

handle:10986/27837;Inequality of Economic Opportunity in Turkey;An Assessment Using Asset Indicators and Women's Background Variables;Using information on asset ownership, housing quality, and access to services to construct an indicator of household wealth, the author estimates the share of inequality among prime-age Turkish women that can be attributed to unequal opportunities. Both parametric and non-parametric estimation methods are used, and robustness to some sample redefinitions is verified. The author find that at least one-third (one-fourth) of overall wealth (imputed consumption) inequality in Turkey is associated with morally irrelevant, pre-determined circumstances. The circumstances that account for the largest share of the variance are rural or urban birth area and father's education. Controlling for rural birth, parents' education, language spoken at home, and number of siblings, a three-way regional breakdown of birthplace is not an important predictor of wealth. An opportunity deprivation profile reveals that more than two thirds of the most deprived group in Turkey consists of women born in the rural areas of the Eastern region, from mothers with no formal education.;"Ferreira, Francisco H.

handle:10986/27841;Modeling for Watershed Management;A Practitioner's Guide;"Watershed management problems are usually quite diverse, and involve a wide range of biological, geological, chemical, and physical processes with complex human, social, and economic contexts. The working note seeks to show that computer modeling allows us to better organize, test, and refine our thinking about watershed management problems and potential solutions. Typically, the flow of water leads modeling to be organized into the following areas: (i) precipitation and climate models; (ii) precipitation-runoff models; (iii) stream and aquifer models; (iv) infrastructure operations models; (v) economic, agronomic, social, environmental demand and performance models; and (vi) decision-making models. Selecting the right model to apply to specific problems requires that several factors be considered along with the objectives for modeling in the context of the field decision problem. Key factors include understandability, development and application time, resources required, transferability and maintenance. Good modeling is common-sense and understanding reduced to calculation for the purposes of gaining insights into a real problem. Modeling should aid discussions, help thinking and provide insights to problems where individuals and interests struggle to understand the problem and struggle to work together to address a problem. To aid model development and the interpretation and communication of modeling and model results and insights, simplicity is a great virtue. While complex problems sometimes require complex models, shedding of unneeded complexity is important. Local and in-house expertise is preferred when developing and applying watershed models because of better familiarity with the problems assessed. Model integration is a growing trend but requires as much expertise and resources as development of any single model component.";"Lund, Jay R.

handle:10986/27842;Strategic Community Investment;A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets;This handbook updates and expands upon the learning in IFC's 2000 community development resource guide entitled, Investing in People: Sustaining Communities through Improved Business Practice. It was produced in response to demand from companies for updated how-to guidance and current good practice approaches. Companies around the world engage in community investment efforts as a way to promote local development and benefit stakeholders in their areas of operations. For the private sector, effective community investment programs can help companies gain a social license to operate, access land, reduce project and reputational risks, boost productivity, meet government requirements or global standards, and/or successfully compete for the next venture. The aim of this handbook is to help IFC client companies and the wider private sector operating in emerging markets to think strategically about how they can support community investment programs that are successful, sustainable, and consistent with their business objectives.

handle:10986/27849;Energy;Low Carbon Emissions Scenarios in Brazil;This report synthesizes the findings for the energy sector of a broader study, the Brazil low carbon study, which was undertaken by the World Bank in its initiative to support Brazil's integrated effort towards reducing national and global emissions of greenhouse gases while promoting long term development. The main aim of the study is to examine the potential for abating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Brazil in the energy area and to assess the relative costs of doing so for the time frame 2010-2030. Basically the study seeks to demonstrate by how much, by when and at what cost Brazil could reduce its GHG energy sector emissions. Given its special features, the fuel use and emissions of greenhouse gases in the transportation sector are dealt with in another report of this project. In addition the study aims to provide information for the Brazilian government to enable it to develop a long-term strategy (2030) for reducing carbon in the energy area (except the transport sector) and, more specifically, to provide the technical input needed for evaluating the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions produced by the key economic sectors. In short, the study seeks to identify the different options and opportunities that could justify possible international resources being allocated to Brazil. The teams involved in the study needed first to focus on the proposed mitigation and carbon sequestering options and then, after identifying these proposals, to focus on existing barriers to the successful deployment of these options and suggest a set of public policies which could be mobilized to overcome them. The study also provides estimates of the scale of investments and operating costs likely to be involved, as well as a mitigation cost curve.;"Schaeffer, Roberto

handle:10986/27855;Mongolia;Groundwater Assessment of the Southern Gobi Region;"The report looks critically at the water resources and the current and projected future water demands in the Southern Gobi Region (SGR) using the widely dispersed data and information that are currently available. An important conclusion of the report is that almost all the significant sources of groundwater in the SGR are 'fossil' or 'non-renewable', meaning that they are finite resources which cannot be replenished. Not only will that, but pumping water out of these fosil aquifers tend to cause a drop in the groundwater levels above them. The report proposes practical steps by which water resources development and management could be managed to best serve economic and infrastructure development while giving attention to environmental protection and service to communities in the SGR. The report also highlights the urgent need for more data. A more detailed picture of the distribution and quantity of the groundwater would give planners first, a better idea of both the limits to the growth of the SGR; and, second, of the future water demands, its spatial distribution, quality requirements, and the possibilities to increase water use efficiency and water re-use. Thus there is a need to bring all information and data together to form the basis for rational planning.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-04-30;en;"capacity building;climate change;land use";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;MNG";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27855;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27855/1/627890REPLACEM07018020110Box361493B.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27855/627890REPLACEM07018020110Box361493B.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27856;Private Providers of Climate Change Services;The Role and Scope for the Private Sector in the Provision of Non-Financial Climate Change-Related Services Relevant to Water Infrastructure;Man-made climate change is affecting water infrastructure in all regions of the world, affecting large numbers of people in their daily life and the development of their societies. As part of the World Bank Water Anchor's analytical and advisory work on water and climate change, consultants have investigated how private sector services to infrastructure may address the challenges related to climate change while, at the same time, improving development opportunities for people. This report, which is one of the outcomes of the work, addresses the role of private providers of non-financial climate change-related services with relevance for water infrastructure. This report investigates to need for additional services with regard to climate change and analyzes the potential for the private sector in providing these services. The analysis focuses on the water sectors likely to be affected by climate change, that is, water resources management, irrigation and drainage, hydropower, coastal protection, flood protection, urban water supply, and sanitation as well as water quality. In addition, opportunities for mutual engagement of public and private agencies are analyzed and the perspectives of market development are explored. The central aim of the report is to deepen our understanding of the opportunities for engaging private providers of climate change services in climate change adaptation combined with socioeconomic development opportunities.;Winpenny, J.T.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-06-30;en;"agriculture;capacity building;climate change;land use;slums;urban areas;water management";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27856;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27856/1/555710NWP0WN2610Box349455B01PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27856/555710NWP0WN2610Box349455B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27857;Water and Climate Change;Impacts on Groundwater Resources and Adaptation Options;"Adaptation to climate impacts on groundwater resources in developed and developing countries has not received adequate attention. This reflects the often poorly understood impacts of climate change, the hidden nature of groundwater and the general neglect of groundwater management. Many developing countries are highly reliant on groundwater. Given expectations of reduced supply in many regions and growing demand, pressure on groundwater resources is set to escalate. This is a crucial problem and demands urgent action. This report addresses the impacts of climate change on groundwater and adaptation options. The Earth's climate is projected to become warmer and more variable. Increased global temperatures are projected to affect the hydrologic cycle, leading to changes in precipitation patterns and increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme events; reduced snow cover and widespread melting of ice; rising sea levels; and changes in soil moisture, runoff and groundwater recharge. Increased evaporation and the risk of flooding and drought could adversely affect security of water supply, particularly surface water. Due to these pressures, as well as global population growth, demand for groundwater is likely to increase.";"Clifton, Craig

handle:10986/27883;Investing across Borders 2010;Indicators of Foreign Direct Investment Regulation in 87 Economies;Investing Across Borders 2010 (IAB) presents cross-country indicators analyzing laws, regulations, and practices affecting foreign direct investment (FDI) in 87 economies. The indicators focus on 4 thematic areas measuring how foreign companies invest across sectors, start local businesses, access industrial land, and arbitrate commercial disputes. The indicators combine analysis of laws and regulations, as well as their implementation. They explore differences across countries to identify good practices, facilitate learning opportunities, stimulate reforms, and provide cross-country data for research and analysis. The project's methodology is based on the World Bank Group's Doing Business initiative. The IAB indicators draw on data collected through a survey of lawyers, other professional service providers (mainly accounting and consulting firms), investment promotion institutions, chambers of commerce, and other expert respondents in each of the countries measured. Between April and December 2009 more than 2,350 experts in 87 economies responded to the survey to provide data for this report. This chapter presents the report's main findings including examples of FDI competitiveness-enhancing practices for each indicator area. It also provides key results for each region. IAB does not measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to investors. For example, it does not measure security, macroeconomic stability, market size and potential, corruption, skill levels, or infrastructure quality. Still, the indicators provide a starting point for governments seeking to improve their competitiveness in attracting foreign investment.;;"International Finance Cooperation;Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency;World Bank Group";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-12-31;en;;;;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27883;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27883/1/643710WP0Inves00Box0361535B0PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27883/643710WP0Inves00Box0361535B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27888;Climate Risk and Financial Institutions;Challenges and Opportunities;This report analyzes in some detail the risks to project finance and the performance of real-sector investments. Options, futures, derivatives, foreign exchange and more exotic instruments are not specifically addressed. The objectives of institutional investors, such as pension funds, include creation of sustained revenues over a long period of time. Clearly, given this long-term perspective, institutional investors need to be particularly aware of growing risks to their investments in climatically sensitive sectors or regions. This report demonstrates that climate change and its impacts are likely to alter a number of conditions that are material to the objectives of financial institutions. If changing conditions are not actively managed, investments and institutions may underperform. Most investments will be channeled through financial institutions. Given that the main effects of climate change are now well established, there is a considerable opportunity, as well as a responsibility, for these institutions to take a leading role in adaptation to climate change. Institutions managing investments in long-lived assets have both a direct financial risk to consider and the opportunity to create value by working proactively with their clients and other stakeholders to take steps to manage the risks. Going forward, International Finance Corporation (IFC) will initiate the development of more general tools addressing climate risks and investments.;"Stenek, Vladimir

handle:10986/27893;Increasing the Participation of Women Entrepreneurs in the Solomon Islands Aid Economy;;International aid flows are equivalent to almost half of Solomon Islands' economy, making it one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world. Around US$250 million of non-military aid enters the country, but only 15-20 percent of this amount is spent locally through local procurement or staff expenditure. Solomon Islands are currently highly reliant on logging for export receipts, Government revenues, and employment. But existing stocks of natural forest logs are expected to be entirely exhausted by 2014. The Solomon Islands Government approached the World Bank Group to identify alternative sources of revenue, foreign exchange receipts, and employment in the absence of logging. In responding to this request, the World Bank Group has undertaken extensive analytical work examining short and medium-term prospects for economic growth in Solomon Islands, under the sources of growth project. This report contributes to the sources of growth work, and is informed by its findings. A key conclusion arising from sources of growth analysis is that aid is likely to remain a key part of the Solomon Islands economy for the near future. The existence of an international security guarantee, backed by the presence of an international peacekeeping force, is paramount for security, and investment certainty. In the absence of clear or certain alternatives to logging, and in the context of rapid population growth, current levels of service delivery will continue to depend on high levels of aid expenditure.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;"land registration;urban areas";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;SLB";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27893;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27893/1/589180WP0SI0Wo10Box353823B01PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27893/589180WP0SI0Wo10Box353823B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27894;Madagascar;Reforming Land Administration and Management for Equitable Growth and Social Cohesion;A well-functioning land administration and management system is crucial for Madagascar's economic and social future. Land is implicated in Madagascar's ongoing economic development and social transformation in many important ways, as key a factor in its quest for economic growth, urbanization, transparent decision-making on land-related foreign investments, environment protection, vibrant and sustainable rural communities, political stability, and social cohesion. Striking a balance among different, and sometimes even competing, roles played by land in the economic and social development process is a daunting challenge facing the Government. It is not an exaggeration to argue that soundness of land administration and management system will play a crucial role in determining the shape and trajectory of Madagascar's economic and social future. Madagascar's quest for overall economic growth, urbanization, sustainable rural development, environment protection, and social cohesion calls for a transparent, inclusive, equitable, efficient, and service-oriented land administration and management system. This policy note presents six policy recommendations aiming to help the Government to continue and deepen land tenure reform. All these six policy recommendations are made based on a review of the history of the Malagasy land institution, an assessment on the implementation of the national land tenure reform program since 2005, and an examination on the major remaining land-related challenges. International experiences have also been introduced whenever they are relevant. It is believed that now is a good time for the Government of Madagascar to tackle these challenges and consider these policy recommendations.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2010-03-31;en;"agriculture;land administration;land grabbing;land law;land management;land ownership;land reform;land registration;land rights;land tenure;land transactions;land use;landowners;rural areas;rural development;urban areas;urban planning;urbanization";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;MDG";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27894;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27894/1/808720WP0Madag0box037982200PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27894/808720WP0Madag0box037982200PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

But even before the global economic crisis, progress in achieving some MDGs, especially those on child and maternal mortality, primary school completion, hunger, and sanitation, was lagging. The global food, fuel and economic crises have set back progress to the MDGs. An estimated 64 million more people are living on less than $1.25/day than there would have been without the crisis. The challenges ahead are achieving the MDGs requires a vibrant global economy, powered by strong, sustainable, multi-polar growth, underpinned by sound policies and reform at the country level; improving access for the poor to health, education, affordable food, trade, finance, and basic infrastructure is key to accelerating progress to the MDGs; developing countries need to continue to strengthen resilience to global volatility in order to protect gains and sustain progress toward the MDGs; the international community must renew its commitment to reach the 'bottom billion', particularly those in fragile and conflict-affected countries; and global support for a comprehensive development agenda including through the G20 process is critical.

handle:10986/27900;A Strategic Approach to Climate Change in the Philippines;An Assessment of Low-Carbon Interventions in the Transport and Power Sectors;Globally, the Philippines is a minor emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but cost-effective mitigation present opportunities that should be captured, noting that the country is one of the signatory member states to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol. The country accounts for less than 0.3 percent of global GHG emissions in 2004.4 However, emissions are on the rise from both energy-use and land-use changes. Even if the absolute scale will remain small, there are increasing number of development projects under preparation, which offers opportunities for cost-effective mitigation and adaptation measures. The Philippine Government's response to the climate change challenge has been active institutionally noting the recent restructuring of the Presidential task force on climate change. However, a clear strategy and action plan are still lacking. The international donor community, including development partners such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), is actively engaged in addressing climate change in the Philippines. There are several initiatives on capacity building for GHG accounting, monitoring and reporting, for preparation of a second National Communication to the UNFCCC, governance, renewable energy, urban air quality management, and forest management. There are likewise several World Bank supported climate change-related activities, with nine active operations.

handle:10986/27940;Investment Efficiency and the Distribution of Wealth;;"The point of departure of this paper is that in the absence of effectively functioning asset markets the distribution of wealth matters for efficiency. Inefficient asset markets depress total factor productivity (TFP) in two ways: first, by not allowing efficient firms to grow to the size that they should achieve (this could include many great firms that are never started); and second, by allowing inefficient firms to survive by depressing the demand for factors (good firms are too small) and hence factor prices. Both of these effects are dampened when the wealth of the economy is in the hands of the most productive people, again, for two reasons: first, because they do not rely as much on asset markets to get outside resources into the firm; and second, because wealth allows them to self insure and therefore they are more willing to take the right amount of risk. None of this, however, tells us that efficiency enhancing redistributions must always be targeted to the poorest. There is some reason to believe that a lot of the inefficiency lies in the fact that many medium size firms are too small.";Banerjee, Abhijit V.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-12-31;en;"agriculture;expropriation;farmers;land ownership;land reform;land rights;land titling;transaction costs";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27940;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27940/1/577520NWP0Box353767B01PUBLIC10gcwp053web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27940/577520NWP0Box353767B01PUBLIC10gcwp053web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27970;Peer Effects in the Demand for Property Rights;Experimental Evidence from Urban Tanzania;This paper investigates the presence of endogenous peer effects in the adoption of formal property rights. Using data from a unique land titling experiment held in an unplanned settlement in Dar es Salaam, the analysis finds a strong, positive impact of neighbor adoption on the household's choice to purchase a land title. The paper also shows that this relationship holds in a separate, identical experiment held a year later in a nearby community, as well as in administrative data for more than 160,000 land parcels in the same city. Although the exact channel is undetermined, the evidence points toward complementarities in the reduction in expropriation risk, as peer effects are strongest between households living close to each other and there is some evidence that peer effects are strongest for households most concerned with expropriation. The results show that, within the Tanzanian context, households will reinforce each other’s decisions to enter formal tenure systems.;Collin, Matthew;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2017-08-31;en;"land tenure;property rights";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"TZA;002";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27970;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27970/1/WPS8163.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27970/WPS8163.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/27973;Buses, Houses or Cash?;Socio-Economic, Spatial and Environmental Consequences of Reforming Public Transport Subsidies in Buenos Aires;Transit subsidies in the urban area of Buenos Aires are high, amounting to a total of US$5 billion for 2012. They have been challenged on several counts: suspected of driving urban sprawl and associated infrastructure costs, diverting resources from system maintenance, and failing to reach the poor among others. In this context, this paper examines the impacts of cost recovery fares under a range of different policy scenarios that could cushion the impact of fare increases. The alternative scenarios that are scrutinized are the uncompensated removal of the transit subsidy, its replacement by a lump sum transfer, and its replacement by two different construction subsidy schemes. Using a dynamic urban model (NEDUM-2D) calibrated for the urban area of Buenos Aires, all scenarios are assessed along four dimensions: (i) the efficiency/welfare impact on residents, (ii) the impacts on the internal structure of the urban area and sprawl, (iii) the impact on commuting-related carbon dioxide emissions, and (iv) the redistributive impacts, with a focus on the poorest households. A series of results emerge. First, there are consumption-related welfare gains for residents associated with replacing the transit subsidy by a lump sum transfer. Second, there are only moderate reductions in urbanization over time and thus infrastructure costs associated with the subsidy removal. Third, the replacement of the transit subsidy leads to only moderate increases in carbon dioxide emissions despite lower public transport mode shares, because households will chose to settle closer to jobs, thereby reducing commuting distances. Finally, the replacement of the transit subsidy by a lump sum transfer will lead to short-term harsh redistributive impacts for captive transit users in some areas of the urban area. Medium-term adjustments of land and housing prices will partially mitigate the negative impacts of higher transport costs for tenants, but will further hurt homeowners.;"Avner, Paolo

The paper examines the impact of the Rural Capacity Building Project using panel data on 1,485 geographically dispersed households in project and control kebeles. The results show that the strengthening of extension services had a positive impact on economic participation in the household, land area cultivated, and adoption of marketable crops, suggesting that access to extension helped farmers switch to more commercial, market-oriented agriculture. In addition, and contrary to previous evidence from other countries, female-headed households seem to have benefited equally from the project. However, the project was not able to reduce the preexisting gender gap in agricultural outcomes.;"Buehren, Niklas

handle:10986/27989;Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture;Priorities for Sector Reform and Investment;"The study focuses on themes and areas that have been identified as highly relevant for the modernization and commercialization of the agriculture sector. The study originally aimed to review: agricultural marketing, processing and exports; food safety; agricultural “cooperation,” including farmers’ groups; agricultural extension and agricultural insurance. This coverage was subsequently modified to: (i) avoid repetition of existing work; (ii) draw more extensively on WBG experience in other countries; (iii) address relevant long-term issues more directly; and (iv) to inform discussion of relevant issues on which little information was available. The proposed review of marketing, processing and exports, an area that has already been well studied – was thus replaced with a review of global experience in developing successful export-led agricultural industries. Similarly, the study of agricultural ‘cooperation,’ an area also widely studied, was replaced with an analysis of agricultural land markets. Both “cooperation” and land markets are highly pertinent to the need to increase farm size to improve competitiveness. Land markets offer a more structural, long-term response to this problem, however, a response that so far has received little attention. Finally, an analysis of public expenditure on agriculture was added to provide insight into public expenditure on long-term versus short-term sector objectives. The review outlines the elements of a long-term framework based on building a cluster-based, institutional framework for horticultural exports, and suggests the need to prioritize associated development of agricultural extension, food safety, agricultural land markets and agricultural risk management. Horticulture is viewed as a vector for modernization and commercialization, due to its demonstrated potential for exports. The proposed framework would drive growth and change throughout the sector, however, due to the sector-wide impact of support for extension, food safety, land markets and risk management.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-06-09;en;land markets;Land & Investments;Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143;ARM";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/27989;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/27989/1/106933-REVISED-PUBLIC-Armenia-Synthesis-6-6-17-print.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/27989/106933-REVISED-PUBLIC-Armenia-Synthesis-6-6-17-print.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28012;Policy Change and Economic Growth;A Case Study of South Africa;South Africa's growth experience provides an example of how contrasting growth trends long-term decline followed by improved growth pivot around political change, in this case a transition to democracy. In the decade prior to 1994, South Africa experienced the worst period of economic growth since the end of the Second World War, with growth variable and declining. The proximate causes of slowing growth were trade and financial sanctions in opposition to the Apartheid government, political instability and macroeconomic policy decisions that resulted in higher inflation, increased uncertainty, and declining investment. Democracy has proved critical for, among other factors, creating the possibility of a peaceful and more stable future and reversing investor sentiment at a basic level. Political and economic leadership have been essential for improving the country's growth performance because of the effect on policy formulation, institutional development, regulatory design, and economic vision. Prudent fiscal policy and sound macroeconomic management have been critical factors in creating an environment conducive to growth by stabilizing economic conditions, lowering the user cost of capital, and putting downward pressure on the real exchange rate. This case study provides some insight into a more general perspective on political and economic transition and some of the key macro- and microeconomic policy shifts that need to occur to realize a more rapid and sustained growth path.;"Faulkner, David

handle:10986/28014;Making Difficult Choices;Vietnam in Transition;After decades of war, with a dilapidated infrastructure and millions of people dead, wounded or displaced, Vietnam could have been considered a hopeless case in economic development. Yet, it is now about to enter the ranks of middle-income countries. The obvious question is: How did this happen? This paper goes one step further, asking not which policies were adopted, but rather why they were adopted. This question is all the more intriguing because the process did not involve one group of individuals displacing another within the structure of power. To answer this question, the paper relies on the insights of those who were actually involved in the economic experiments, conceptual discussions, and political maneuvering that led to the adoption of key reforms. Especially, it builds on a series of long and regular conversations with H. E. the late Vo Van Kiet, one of Vietnam's leading figures. In doing so, it brings into the open the inside story of Doi Moi, a process that is not known by outsiders and remains opaque to most Vietnamese. The relevance of this exercise is not merely historical. Understanding how reforms were engineered may yield valuable lessons for other developing countries. It is also relevant for Vietnam, as two decades of rapid economic growth have resulted in dramatic changes in its economy and society. While praising the decision-making processes that allowed Vietnam to successfully emerge from poverty, the paper also explores the adjustments that could be needed for it to become an industrial country.;Rama, Martin;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"agriculture;climate change;corruption;land reform;poverty;transaction costs;urban areas";Land, Climate change & Environment;;"030;VNM;009";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28014;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28014/1/577390NWP0E0an10gcwp040bilingualweb.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28014/577390NWP0E0an10gcwp040bilingualweb.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28017;Globalization, Growth, and Distribution;Framing the Questions;"In the last two decades, across a range of countries high growth rates have reduced poverty but have been accompanied by rising inequality. This paper is motivated by this stylized fact, and by the strong distributional concerns that persist among populations and policy makers alike, despite the poverty reduction observed in official statistics where growth has been sufficiently high. This seeming disconnects frames the questions posed in this paper. Why the disconnect, and what to do about it? It is argued that official poverty statistics may be missing key elements of the ground level reality of distributional evolution, of which rising inequality may be an indirect indicator. Heterogeneity of population means that there may be significant numbers of poor losers from technical change, economic reform and global integration, even when overall measured poverty falls. In terms of actions, attention is drawn to the role of safety nets as generalized compensation mechanisms, to address the ethical and political economy dimensions of such a pattern of distributional evolution. Addressing structural inequalities is also a long term answer with payoffs in terms of equitable growth. In terms of future analysis, diminishing returns have set in to the inequality-growth cross-country regressions literature. Further work to help policy makers should focus on: (i) new information to illuminate the disconnect; (ii) analysis and assessment of safety nets as generalized compensation mechanisms; and (iii) addressing specific forms of structural inequality related to assets, gender, and social groupings like caste or ethnicity.";Kanbur, Ravi;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"climate change;farmers;rural areas";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28017;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28017/1/577050NWP0Box31UBLIC10gc1wp10051web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28017/577050NWP0Box31UBLIC10gc1wp10051web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28024;Greenhouse Emissions and Climate Change;Implications for Developing Countries and Public Policy;There is no longer any serious debate about whether greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are altering the earth's climate. There is also a broad consensus that efficient mitigation of emissions will require carbon pricing via market based instruments (charges or auctioned tradable permits). The remaining controversies stem mostly from economic and technological forecasting uncertainties, disputes about global and intergenerational equity, and political divisions over collective measures to combat climate change. Near term closure seems unlikely on any of these fronts, but the science is now sufficiently compelling that a global consensus supports concerted action. Developing countries must be full participants, because they will be most heavily impacted by global warming, and because the scale of their emissions is rapidly approaching parity with developed countries.;Wheeler, David;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-12-31;en;"climate change;deforestation;land use;property rights;waste";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28024;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28024/1/577610NWP0Box353767B01PUBLIC10gcwp062web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28024/577610NWP0Box353767B01PUBLIC10gcwp062web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28032;Policy and Institutional Dynamics of Sustained Development in Botswana;;Botswana represents one of the few development success stories in Sub-Saharan Africa. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged almost 9 percent between 1960 and 2005, far above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. Real GDP per capita grew even faster, averaging more than 10 percent a year -- the most rapid economic growth of any country in the world. The crucial question is: Why has Botswana grown the way it has done, and what lessons does it offer? This evidence-based story is an account of policy and institutional dynamics of sustained growth and development in Botswana -- illuminating the role of leadership. It shows how a secure political elite has pursued growth-promoting policies and developed, modified, and maintained viable inherited traditional and modern institutions of political, economic, and legal restraint. These institutions have remained robust in the face of initial large aid inflows and spectacular mineral rents, producing a growth pattern that has been both rapid and cautious. The nature of the Botswana developmental state is illustrated by the way in which the state mobilized development resources-especially savings, investment, and human resources, widely known as the primary drivers of economic growth, and prudently managed the economy without becoming excessively involved in the nuts. It demonstrates that through intentional policy choices and countercyclical instruments, countries can shift from aid-dependent to trade-led natural resource development (though probably with narrow-based growth), to a broader development strategy as long as the state is capable and operates within effective institutional design. Botswana's story is sterling example of how the critical issue in development is not so much access to resources but how resources are managed.;Maipose, Gervase S.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"agriculture;land policies;landowners;property rights;sustainable development;urbanization";"Urban Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;BWA";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28032;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28032/1/577340NWP0Box353767B01PUBLIC10gcwp035web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28032/577340NWP0Box353767B01PUBLIC10gcwp035web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

If anything stands out favorably in recent Brazilian experience, it is not growth but stabilization and the successful opening of the economy. The purpose of this paper is more modest. It is limited to setting out the authors' particular view of recent efforts to consolidate democracy in Brazil while controlling inflation and resuming economic growth. At the same time the paper presents, as objectively as possible, some thoughts on the limits but also the relevance of action by political leaders to set a course and circumvent obstacles to that process. Here and there, the paper refers to the experiences of other Latin American countries, especially Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, not to offer a full fledged comparative analysis but merely to note contrasts and similarities that may shed light on the peculiarities of the Brazilian case and suggest themes for a more wide-ranging exchange of views.;"Cardoso, Fernando Henrique

handle:10986/28043;Housing Policy in Developing Countries;The Importance of the Informal Economy;All countries have a formal economy and an informal economy. But, on average, in developing countries the relative size of the informal sector is considerably larger than in developed countries. This paper argues that this has important implications for housing policy in developing countries. That most poor households derive their income from informal employment effectively precludes income-contingent transfers as a method of redistribution. Also, holding fixed real economic activity, the larger is the relative size of the informal sector, the lower is fiscal capacity, and the more distortionary is government provision of a given level of goods and services, which restricts the desirable scale and scope of government policy. For the same reasons, housing policies that have proven successful in developed countries may not be successful when employed in developing countries.;Arnott, Richard;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"decentralization;eviction;informal settlements;land tenure;land use;occupation;property rights;slums;squatters;urban population;urbanization;zoning";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28043;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28043/1/577130NWP0Box353766B01PUBLIC10gcwp013web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28043/577130NWP0Box353766B01PUBLIC10gcwp013web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Just like in developed economies, there is strong evidence that cities in developing countries bolster productive efficiency. Regarding whether cities promote self-sustained growth, the evidence is suggestive but ultimately inconclusive. These findings imply that the traditional agenda of aiming to raise within-city efficiency should be continued. Furthermore, reducing the obstacles to the reallocation of factors across cities is also desirable.;Duranton, Gilles;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"climate change;land;land ownership;poverty;property rights;rural areas;slums;squatters;urban population;urbanization;zoning";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28044;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28044/1/577120NWP0Box31UBLIC10gc1wp10121web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28044/577120NWP0Box31UBLIC10gc1wp10121web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28047;Economic Growth in Egypt;Impediments and Constraints (1974-2004);The paper focuses its analysis on the last three decades of the twentieth century. The basic assumption is that Egypt's economic performance during this period was less than satisfactory compared with the most successful examples in the far East and elsewhere. The paper also assumes that Egypt's initial conditions at midcentury compared favorably with the winners in the development race at the end of the century. Egypt has achieved positive progress, no doubt, yet compared with the higher performers in Asia, and given its favorable good initial conditions, the record seems quite mediocre. By mid-twentieth century, Egypt's agriculture had almost reached its limits. Egypt, therefore, faced a new challenge: a need to transform itself into an industrial society. This objective was only partially achieved. The paper identifies three interrelated factors that helped hinder Egypt's accession to a new industrial society. The first factor is a strong state and a weak society. An authoritarian state that in its endeavor to preserve its prerogatives had to give up good governance practices and limit the creative initiative of the individuals. The second factor is a semi-rentier economy. The availability of windfall revenues not only reduced the pressure for change but also promoted a new rentier mentality that undermined the emergence of an industrial spirit. The third factor is an inadequate education system. This system failed to provide the proper skills and values required for the industrial society. These factors, moreover, are interdependent and reinforce each other.;El Beblawi, Hazem;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"climate change;corruption;land ownership;property rights";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"EGY;145;015";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28047;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28047/1/577140NWP0Box31UBLIC10gc1wp10141web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28047/577140NWP0Box31UBLIC10gc1wp10141web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28048;Battles Half Won;The Political Economy of India's Growth and Economic Policy since Independence;Rapid growth since 1980 has transformed India from the world's 50th ranked economy in nominal U.S. dollars to the 10th largest in 2005. The growth of per capita income has helped reduce poverty. At the same time, evidence suggests that income inequality is rising and that the gap in average per capita income between the rich and poor states is growing. This paper reviews India's long term growth experience with a view to understanding the determinants of growth and the underlying political economy. The paper looks specifically at the political economy of India's growth transformation from a low-growth environment (pre-1980s) to a rapid-growth environment (post 1980s) and asks how sustainable is this transformation in view of concerns about regional disparity and income inequality. The paper concludes that the pledge that India's post-independence leadership had undertaken to abolish mass poverty remains only partially redeemed. Half the battle still lies ahead. Many more would like the fruits of the economic boom to come to them. The greatest challenge for India's policy makers today is to balance the growth momentum with inclusionary policies.;"Ahmed, Sadiq

handle:10986/28090;A Palestinian State in Two Years;Institutions for Economic Revival;"On August 25, 2009, the 13th Government of the Palestinian Authority (PA) presented a program entitled ""Palestine: ending the occupation, establishing the state"" (hereafter referred to as the program) outlining several national goals, including the achievement of 'economic independence and national prosperity'. The program accords high priority to the development of the public institutions of the PA in order to achieve the stated national goals. It acknowledges that maintaining an efficient and effective public sector that provides citizens with high quality services and value for money is a constant challenge. No amount of well-functioning institutions, will, however, lead to economic growth in the absence of access to markets, whether within the West Bank and Gaza, in Israel, or in the rest of the world. In this regard, the recent developments in easing of movement and access restrictions by the Government of Israel (GoI) represent a welcome first step. The GoI has taken steps to ease movement restrictions in the West Bank and to allow greater access to West Bank markets for Arab citizens of Israel. In the first half of 2009, the political stalemate in Gaza continued and the economy stagnated. The West Bank economy is showing signs of new growth, so that it is possible that for the first time in years, West Bank and Gaza (WB&G) may have positive per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2009.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-09-22;en;"adjudication;expropriation;land administration;land management;land registration;land titling;property rights";Land Conflicts;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"145;015;PSE";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28090;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28090/1/760200WP0GZ0AH00Box374357B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28090/760200WP0GZ0AH00Box374357B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28091;Palestinian Economic Prospects;Gaza Recovery and West Bank Revival;In its report to the September 22, 2008 meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC), the World Bank noted that the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel, and the international donor community made some progress on the three parallel conditions for Palestinian economic revival, albeit to different degrees. The report notes the dramatic impact of Israel s recent three-week offensive in Gaza and analyzes the variety of recovery and reconstruction schemes being explored by the donor community. We find that these have not yet led to any significant impact on the ground due to the continued closure imposed on Gaza. The devastation in Gaza, coupled with a fluid political environment in both the PA and Israel, has made it necessary for this report to revisit the fundamentals of donor support to the PA in view of the long-term goal of establishing an economically viable Palestinian state independent of external aid. Examination through this lens reveals a fundamentally flawed picture.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-06-08;en;"corruption;land administration;land registration;land use;property rights;transaction costs";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"145;015;PSE";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28091;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28091/1/760170WP0GZ0AH00Box374357B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28091/760170WP0GZ0AH00Box374357B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28099;Crop Output in Vietnam, 1992 to 2006;An Analysis of the Patterns and Sources of Growth;The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of cropping output in agriculture between 1992 and 2006 in Vietnam at both the national and regional level. There are several motivations. The report focuses our analysis on trends with respect to how rapidly output was growing in real terms. The next parts of the chain will link output to farm incomes more directly. First this requires information on the value-added from crop production (gross output value less the cost of intermediate inputs) in order to convert gross revenue into real net income. Second, the report will have to convert 'real farm profits' measured in producer prices, to 'real incomes' that link to farmer welfare, utilizing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for rural households. Third, the period 1992 through 2006 has been one of considerable change in the economic and policy environment that might affect the growth of agriculture. In this report, the report focus only on the trends in real output at the national and sub-regional level, and save the latter two links of the chain for future work.;"Benjamin, Dwayne

handle:10986/28100;Ethnic Minority Poverty in Vietnam;;Although economic reform has brought remarkable progress in poverty reduction in Vietnam, the scale and depth of ethnic minority poverty in Vietnam presents one of the major challenges to achieving the targets for poverty reduction set out in the Socio-Economic Development Plan, as well as the millennium development goals. The authors first review a series of monetary and non-monetary indicators which show the living standards of the ethnic minorities are improving but still lag seriously behind those of the majority Kinh-Hoa. The minorities' lower living standards result from the complex interplay of overlapping disadvantages, which start in utero and continue until adult life. Next an analysis of the drivers of the ethnic gap, in terms of both differences in characteristics and differences in returns to those characteristics, is undertaken. Mean and quantile decompositions show that at least a half of the gap in per capita expenditure can be attributed to the lower returns to characteristics that the ethnic minorities receive. The reasons underlying such differences in returns are discussed, drawing on both quantitative analysis and the large number of qualitative studies on ethnic issues in Vietnam. Finally, some of the short and longer term policy measures which the authors believe could help to counter ethnic disadvantages in the nutrition, education, and employment sectors are discussed. The authors also emphasize the importance of promoting growth that is geographically broad and socially inclusive without which, the current disparities between the Kinh-Hoa and the ethnic minorities will continue to grow.;"Baulch, Bob

handle:10986/28104;Nicaragua Social Protection Public Expenditure Review;;"This review of public expenditures on Social Protection (SP) in Nicaragua is based on the analytical framework of Social Risk Management (SRM) developed by the World Bank. The concept of managing social risk comes from the notion that certain groups in society are vulnerable to unexpected shocks which threaten their livelihood and/or survival. Social protection focuses on the poor since they are more vulnerable to the risks and normally do not have the instruments to handle these risks. This prevents the poor from taking more risky activities that usually yield higher returns and that could help them overcome gradually their poverty situation. Social risk management involves policies and programs aimed at reducing key risks, breaking inter-generational cycle of poverty and vulnerability. Risk management consists in the choice of appropriate risk prevention, mitigation and coping strategies to minimize the adverse impact of social risks. Social protection under SRM is defined as public interventions to assist individuals, households and communities to better manage risk and provide support to the critically poor. Thus Social protection should provide: a safety net, particularly for the poor that are likely to fall in the cracks of established programs; and a springboard for the poor to bounce out of poverty.";Marques, Jose Silverio;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-03-12;en;"agrarian reform;farmers;land distribution;land tenure;natural disasters;natural resources management;rural areas;rural development;rural population;urban areas";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"NIC;419";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28104;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28104/1/716870WP0P10720Protection000English.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28104/716870WP0P10720Protection000English.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/28117;The Pharmaceutical Sector in Ghana;;Main pharmaceutical policy goals in Ghana are access to essential medicines for everybody, quality assurance for all drugs on the market, a functioning and efficient supply chain as well as rational use of medicines by professionals and patients. There is also a commitment to strengthen the domestic pharmaceutical industry, outlined under health industry in the national health policy. The National Health Insurance System (NHIS) has significantly improved access to medicines for insured patients, measured in increased utilization of facilities and rapidly growing turnover of revolving drug funds. The risk is now that non-rational prescribing and fraud lead to a growing medicine bill that threatens financial sustainability of NHIS. On the other hand, National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has the resources and purchasing power to influence provider behavior as well as the market in terms of quality and price. The purpose of this policy note is to provide a compact overview of the situation, trends and opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector in Ghana as relevant to the strategic objectives in the five year program of work. It summarizes data from a number of recent studies and reports that were done by a range of partners inside and outside the country as well as discussions with key stakeholders in the sector. The intent is to give decision makers up-to-date background information and provide some suggestions for specific policy initiatives designed to achieve the work program objectives, with a particular focus on the role health insurance can play to stabilize and improve service delivery, increase access to quality medicines and promote rational use. The overall legal framework for the pharmaceutical sector is set by the Food and Drugs Law from 1992, amended by Act 523 in 1996. It defines the role of the food and drugs board as separate entity under control of the Ministry of Health (MOH), responsible for regulating the sector. The Food and Drugs Board (FDB) also runs the official drug quality control laboratory that is in charge of testing quality samples obtained from manufacturers, importers, distributors or other sources. The FDB is also working on an improvement of its public website in an effort to strengthen communication with the general public to increase transparency and improve governance.;"Seiter, Andreas

handle:10986/28121;Republic of Serbia Financial Sector Assessment Program Update;Corporate and Household Debt Restructuring;Nonperforming Loans (NPLs) in the banking system constituted 16.5 percent of total loans, owing primarily to the corporate sector. The Credit Bureau, maintained by the Association of Serbian Banks, also discloses dramatic increases in corporate and retail defaults over the past year. NPL resolution and loan loss mitigation is hampered by a still evolving but uneven collateral and enforcement framework that complicates restructuring and leads to delays and lower recoveries in execution procedures. Corporate debt resolution is further complicated by a pattern of corporate misconduct designed to circumvent a creditor's legitimate enforcement rights. This is particularly acute in response to account blockages. In an effort to survive, business owners frequently engage in a pattern of corporate fraud to avoid their legitimate obligations by creating alter ego or shell companies through which to conduct their ongoing business activities, with all funds passing through the new legal entity. That entity is free from debt and can open bank accounts, engage in contracts, and carry on business as usual using the corporate assets of the prior legal entity under cleverly disguised lease or contractual use obligations. In most modern economies, such practices constitute fraud or fraudulent transfers that can carry stiff penalties, including loss of business privileges. Other reported abuses include applying for voluntary dissolution during which the owner or a friendly receiver continues to operate the business for years in an apparent wind-down of the business, while ignoring creditor claims.;;"International Monetary Fund;World Bank Group";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-10-31;en;"land ownership;property rights";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"SRB;150;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28121;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28121/1/792410WP0Serbi0Box0377370B00Public0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28121/792410WP0Serbi0Box0377370B00Public0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28124;Agricultural Activities, Water, and Gender in Tajikistan's Rural Sector;A Social Assessment of Konibodom, Bobojon Ghafurov, and Yovon;"This social assessment (SA) was conducted under the Fergana Valley Water Resources Management Project (FVWRMP), which is providing assistance to the Government of Tajikistan to address irrigation and drainage deficiencies in Eastern Sughd. The main SA objectives were to understand how prevailing structures of water provision, land reforms, and gender relations impact rural livelihoods; to analyze experiences in establishing inclusive Water Users Associations (WUAs); and to provide recommendations to FVWRMP with the aim of enhancing its programs. The SA targeted nine jamoats divided equally among Bobojon Ghafurov, Konibodom, and Yovon districts. The two northern districts were covered by FVWRMP and the Farm Privatization Support Program (FPSP) operated in the southern district (Yovon). Yovon's jamoats were selected specifically to analyze their WUAs formed in conjunction with farm privatization carried out under FPSP. Due to the limited number of community-based water management initiatives in the above-mentioned target areas, other WUAs were included in this study. A survey questionnaire was administered to 1275 households. Fifteen focus groups (mostly-female) and 38 in-depth interviews were also conducted. The SA results raise stakeholder awareness of the main water-related issues faced in the target areas as well as the major factors influencing WUA operations. While some of the study's recommendations are beyond the scope of FVWRMP and must be dealt with through other initiatives, as a response to the SA findings, the project is now aiming to continue its work on the rehabilitation of irrigation networks, drainage systems, and reservoir dykes and to emphasize institutional development through establishing water users associations and issuing land use certificates.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-08-31;en;"agriculture;animal husbandry;farmers;land reform;land tenure;rural development;water management";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150;TJK;143";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28124;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28124/1/561660WP0Box341jikSocAssessment1web.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28124/561660WP0Box341jikSocAssessment1web.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

Negative impacts from climate change are likely to be greatest in regions that are currently food insecure and may even be significant in those regions that have made large gains in reducing food insecurity over the past half-century. Adaptation in the agricultural sector is being given a high priority within this effort because of the inherent sensitivity of food production to climate and the strong inter-linkages that exist between climate, agriculture, and economic growth and development. The purpose of this report is to review the major effects of climate change on the agricultural sector; to examine the causes of vulnerability; and to suggest a range of potential options and investment opportunities for supporting adaptation efforts and, more generally, for building adaptive capacity. This report primarily focuses on appropriate strategies for adapting to climate change impacts that are projected to occur over the next one to two decades, although several issues covered in this report are important for long-term adaptation needs as well.

handle:10986/28126;Timor-Leste;Country Environmental Analysis;The Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) for Timor-Leste identifies environmental priorities through a systematic review of environmental issues in natural resources management and environmental health in the context of the country's economic development and environmental institutions. Lack of data has been the main limitation in presenting a more rigorous analysis. Nevertheless, the report builds on the best available secondary data, presents new data on the country's wealth composition, and derives new results on the costs of water and air pollution. The CEA calls for urgent attention to gaps in the environmental management framework, the lack of capacity to implement the few regulations in place, and the high cost of indoor air pollution and poor water, sanitation, and hygiene. Timor-Leste is a young country that regained independence in 2002, and it has emerged from a bitter past burdened by colonialism and violent conflicts. It is still a fragile state facing enormous challenges. The report also points out the lack of clean water, appropriate sanitation, and hygiene as an environmental priority. The CEA estimates that this imposes an economic cost of about $17 million per year by way of illness and premature death. The CEA also looks at outdoor air pollution and at natural resource management for land, forestry, and coastal and marine resources. Outdoor air pollution is not a serious problem for the time being, but it could become so in the long run if the economy grows rapidly, urbanization continues, heavy industry emerges, and motorization increases rapidly. This underlines the need for good forward territorial and development planning. In conclusion, much good work has already been done to enhance the quality of the environment in Timor-Leste.

handle:10986/28132;Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy;;This report is concerned with the development of the infrastructure which is required in order to support proposed mines in Southern Mongolia. In order for the mines to be developed, it will be necessary to provide towns for the new inhabitants, road and rail links to provide supplies and to transport the mines' products to markets, and electricity for the mines' operations. Water resources need to be investigated and supplied to the mines and towns. And as all of the development advances, consideration needs to be given to mitigating any negative environmental and social impacts. The geographic focus of the report varies according to the particular topic. The mines are all located in a region which this report defines as 'Southern Mongolia', and which includes the images of Omnogovi, Dornogovi, Govisumber and Dundgovi. The majority of the important new mines are located in Omnogovi, and the analysis of housing and social impacts is concentrated in areas close to these mines. In terms of time, the report concentrates on the most important priorities for government action up to 2015. Nevertheless, consideration is given to a longer time-horizon when considering the potential environmental and water resource demands likely to arise as a result of the region's development. The report is not concerned with the longer-term actions required for broader economic development of the region, including the development of value-added industries associated with the mining industry. To get to long-term objectives, it is necessary to start with the short term.

The Chinese Government has fully recognized these challenges and is aiming to promote more sustainable urbanization in line with the objectives of the eleventh five year plan, which calls for 'building a resource-conserving and environmentally friendly society'. Various initiatives are being pursued to support this objective, both at the national and local levels. At the local level, cities have responded by developing 'eco-cities', which aim to promote a more sustainable urbanization model. More than one hundred eco-city initiatives have been launched in recent years. One such initiative is the Sino-Singapore Tianjin eco-city.

handle:10986/28146;Border Price and Export Demand Shocks for Developing Countries from Rest-of-World Trade Liberalization Using the Linkage Model;;The volume on agricultural price distortions, inequality and poverty begins with a global study that uses the World Bank's linkage model to examine the economic impacts in various countries, regions and the world as a whole of agricultural and trade policies as of 2004. It does so by shocking that model with the removal of all agricultural price-distorting domestic and border policies with, and without, the removal of trade policies affecting all other goods. That pair of shocks is also employed in another global study in that volume to examine the inequality and poverty implications of those price-distorting policies for more than 100 countries. Then for ten national studies reported in that volume, the Linkage model again is used, but only to provide an exogenous set of shocks to the national economy wide model employed by the authors of each developing country case study. The effects of that shock on a national economy are then compared with the effects of own-country liberalization using the same national model and the same agricultural protection rates for that country as in the global Linkage model.

handle:10986/28148;Agricultural Price Distortions, Inequality, and Poverty;Introduction and Summary;Reforms in recent decades have sharply reduced the distortions affecting agriculture in developing countries, particularly by cuts to agricultural export taxes and by some reductions in government assistance to agriculture in high-income countries, but international trade in farm products continues to be far more distorted than trade in nonfarm goods. This paper summarizes a series of empirical studies that focus on the effects of the remaining distortions to world merchandise trade for poverty and inequality, especially in developing countries. To obtain different insights into the various impacts, two global studies are undertaken using the World Bank's Linkage model, one multi-country study uses the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model, and ten country case studies are also included, each using a national economy-wide model. The Linkage model results suggest that liberalization will reduce international inequality, largely by boosting farm incomes and raising real wages for unskilled workers in developing countries, and will reduce the number of poor people worldwide by 3 percent. The analysis based on the GTAP model for a sample of 15 countries, and the ten stand-alone national case studies, all point to larger reductions in poverty, especially if only the non-poor are subjected to increased income taxation to compensate for the loss of trade tax revenue.;"Anderson, Kym

handle:10986/28149;China through 2020;A Macroeconomic Scenario;This paper sketches a macroeconomic scenario for China for 2010-20. Growth accounting exercise finds that, with both the working population and total factor productivity on course to decelerate, potential gross domestic product (GDP) growth is likely to moderate in the coming 10 years, despite still sizeable capital deepening. Actual GDP should grow broadly as fast as potential GDP, continuing the track record since the late 1990s. With some rebalancing expected, the share of consumption in GDP is likely to bottom out and to rise somewhat through 2015 while the share of investment edges down. Robust economic growth in China would support imports. Meanwhile, given the outlook for the world economy, the share of exports in GDP may decline in 2010-2015 despite good competitiveness. As a result, the trade surplus may diminish relative to the size of China's economy. Even so, the external surplus will continue to rise in US dollar terms, especially the current account. In 2020 China's GDP per capita will be broadly comparable to the current level in Latin America, Turkey, and Malaysia. Adjusted for purchasing power, in 2020 China's GDP per capita will be one-fourth of the US level and China's total economy larger than that of the US. The pace of catch up in current prices and market exchange rates will depend on the extent of real exchange rate (RER) appreciation. Past experience internationally suggests that, with a large portion of labor employed in agriculture, RER appreciation may be modest in the coming decade. However, demographic changes may speed up the tightening of the labor market and trend RER appreciation. Reflecting this uncertainty, two scenarios are presented, suggesting China may become the largest economy on this metric sometime between 2020 and 2030.;Kuijs, Louis;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-06-30;en;"agriculture;land reform;urbanization";Urban Tenure;;"030;009;CHN";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28149;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28149/1/565990NWP0chin1medium1term1scenario.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28149/565990NWP0chin1medium1term1scenario.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28150;Renewable Natural Resources;Practical Lessons for Conflict-Sensitive Development;"This paper explores how a 'conflict and violence sensitive' framework in project assessment, design and implementation facilitates early identification and mitigation of negative consequences of competition and dispute, and promotes sustainable development over the longer term. It discusses the role of renewable resources in perpetuating conflict and violence, and distills lessons from selected development programming experiences in managing conflict risks associated with these dynamics. The study emphasizes that building capacity to productively address conflict and to improve community resilience to ecological change decreases vulnerability to violence, and improves livelihoods particularly for the world's poorest communities. The study draws on a range of development experience and specifically examines six case studies: three from the World Bank portfolio and three external to the Bank. Of the World Bank projects, the paper considers Andhra Pradesh Community Forest Management Project (India), Land Conflict and Vulnerability Pilot Project (Afghanistan), and Second Fadama Development Project (Nigeria). The paper also studies three external cases: conservation of managed indigenous areas (Ecuador) and Building the Capacity of Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) to Resolve and Manage Environmental Conflicts in Virunga National Park (DRC), both financed by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and the Community Development Component of German Technical Cooperation's (GTZ's) Palestinian Water Program (West Bank).

handle:10986/28151;Agricultural Distortions, Poverty, and Inequality in South Africa;;South Africa has rapidly reduced trade barriers since the end of Apartheid, yet agricultural production and exports have remained sluggish. Also, poverty and unemployment have risen and become increasingly concentrated in rural areas. This paper examines the extent to which remaining price distortions, both domestic and foreign, are contributing to the underperformance of the agricultural sector vis-a-vis the rest of the economy. The author draws on a computable general equilibrium (CGE) and micro-simulation model of South Africa that is linked to the results of a global trade model. This framework is used to examine the effects of eliminating global and domestic price distortions. Model results indicate that South Africa's agricultural sector currently benefits from global price distortions, and that removing these will create more jobs for lower-skilled workers, thereby reducing income inequality and poverty. The author also fined that South Africa's own policies are biased against agriculture and that removing domestic distortions will raise agricultural production. Job losses in nonagricultural sectors will be outweighed by job creation in agriculture, such that overall employment rises and poverty falls. Overall, the findings suggest that South Africa's own policies are more damaging to its welfare, poverty and inequality than distortionary policies in the rest of the world. Existing national price distortions may thus explain some of the poor performance of South Africa's agricultural sector and rural development.;"Hérault, Nicolas

handle:10986/28152;Agricultural Protection and Poverty in Indonesia;A General Equilibrium Analysis;A general equilibrium modeling approach is used to estimate the effects within Indonesia of unilateral and global trade liberalization, including effects on poverty incidence. It is concluded that global reform of trade policy in all commodities is a significant potential source of poverty reduction for Indonesia. The poor rural and urban have a strong interest in global trade policy reform. If Indonesia were to liberalize unilaterally, poverty incidence also will decline but the effect is small. If liberalization is confined to agricultural products, the effects are similar but the declines in poverty incidence within Indonesia are much smaller.;Warr, Peter;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-06-30;en;"agriculture;farmers;rural areas";;Land Use, Management & Investment;"IDN;030;009";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28152;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28152/1/559380NWP0P09311061Indonesia0709rev.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28152/559380NWP0P09311061Indonesia0709rev.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28155;Welfare and Poverty Effects of Global Agricultural and Trade Policies Using the Linkage Model;;This paper analyzes the economic effects of agricultural price and merchandise trade policies around the world as of 2004 on global markets, net farm incomes, and national and regional economic welfare and poverty, using the global economy wide Linkage model, new estimates of agricultural price distortions for developing countries, and poverty elasticity's approach. It addresses two questions: to what extent are policies as of 2004 still reducing rewards from farming in developing countries and thereby adding to inequality across countries in farm household incomes? Are they depressing value added more in primary agriculture than in the rest of the economy of developing countries, and earnings of unskilled workers more than of owners of other factors of production, thereby potentially contributing to inequality and poverty within developing countries (given that farm incomes are well below non-farm incomes in most developing countries and that agriculture there is intensive in the use of unskilled labor)? Results are presented for the key countries and regions of the world and for the world as a whole. They reveal that, by moving to free markets, income inequality between countries will be reduced at least slightly, all but one-sixth of the gains to developing countries will come from agricultural policy reform, unskilled workers in developing countries the majority of whom work on farms will benefit most from reform, net farm incomes in developing countries will rise by 6 percent compared with 2 percent for non-agricultural value added, and the number of people surviving on less than US$1 a day will drop 3 percent globally.;"Anderson, Kym

handle:10986/28156;Economic and Poverty Impacts of Agricultural, Trade, and Factor Market Reforms in China;;Capitalizing on the most recent estimates of agricultural price distortions in China and in other countries, this paper assesses the economic and poverty impact of global and domestic trade reform in China. It also examines the interplay between the trade reforms and factor market reforms aimed at improving the allocation of labor within the Chinese economy. The results suggest that trade reforms in the rest of the world, land reform and hukou reform all serve to reduce poverty, while unilateral trade reforms result in a small poverty increase. Agricultural distortions are important factors in determining the distributional and poverty effects of trade reform packages, although their impacts on aggregate trade and welfare appear to be small. A comprehensive reform package which bundles the reforms in commodity and factor markets together may benefit all broad household groups in China.;"Zhai, Fan

handle:10986/28157;The Poverty Impacts of Global Commodity Trade Liberalization;;This paper examines the poverty impacts of global merchandise trade reform by looking at a wide range of developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Overall, the authors find that trade reform tends to reduce poverty primarily through the inclusion of agricultural components. The majority of developing country sample experiences small poverty increases from non-agricultural reforms. The authors explore the relative poverty-friendliness of agricultural trade reforms in detail, examining the differential impacts on real after-tax factor returns of agricultural versus non-agricultural reforms. This analysis is extended to the distribution of households by looking at stratum-specific poverty changes. The author's findings indicate that the more favorable impacts of agricultural reforms are driven by increased returns to peasant farm households' labor as well as higher returns for unskilled wage labor. Finally, the authors examine the commodity-specific poverty impacts of trade reform for this sample of countries. The authors find that liberalization of food grains and other processed foods represent the largest contributions to poverty reduction. More specifically, it is tariff reform in these commodity markets that dominates the poverty increasing impacts of wealthy country subsidy removal.;"Hertel, Thomas W.

handle:10986/28159;Explaining Agricultural Distortion Patterns;The Roles of Ideology, Inequality, Lobbying and Public Finance;In this paper, the authors examine the political economy drivers of the variation in agricultural protection, both across countries and within countries over time. The paper starts by listing the key insights provided by both the theoretical and empirical literature on the political economy of trade policy formulation. The authors then set out a basic framework that allows us to put forth various testable hypotheses on the variation and evolution of agricultural protection. The authors find that both the political ideology of the government and the degree of income inequality are important determinants of agricultural protection. Thus, both the political-support-function approach as well as the median-voter approach can be used in explaining the variation in agricultural protection across countries and within countries over time. The results are consistent with the predictions of a model that assumes that labor is specialized and sector-specific in nature. Some aspects of protection also seem to be consistent with predictions of a lobbying model in that agricultural protection is negatively related to agricultural employment and positively related to agricultural productivity. Public finance aspects of protection also seem to be empirically important.;"Dutt, Pushan

handle:10986/28162;Political Economy of Anglo-French Trade, 1689-1899;Agricultural Trade Policies, Alcohol Taxes, and War;Britain contrary to received wisdom was not a free trader for most of the 1800s and, despite repeal of the Corn Laws, continued to have higher tariffs than the French until the last quarter of the century. War with Louis fourteenth from 1689 led to the end of all trade between Britain and France for a quarter of a century. The creation of powerful protected interests both at home and abroad led to the imposition of prohibitively high tariffs on French imports notably on wine and spirits, when trade with France resumed in 1714. Protection of domestic interests from import competition allowed the state to raise domestic excises which provided increased government revenues despite almost no increases in the taxes on land and income in Britain. The state ensured compliance not simply through the threat of lower tariffs on foreign substitutes but also through the encouragement of a trend towards monopoly production in brewing and restricted retail sales of beer. This history is analyzed in terms of its effects on British fiscal and commercial policy from the early 1700s to the end of the nineteenth century. The result is a fuller, albeit revisionist account of the rise of the modern state that calls into question a variety of theses in economics and political science that draw on the naive view of a liberal Britain unilaterally moving to free trade in the nineteenth century.;Nye, John V.

handle:10986/28166;Political Economy of Agricultural Trade Interventions in Africa;;"This paper uses new data on agricultural policy interventions to examine the political economy of agricultural trade policies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Historically, African governments have discriminated against agricultural producers in general (relative to producers in non-agricultural sectors), and against producers of export agriculture in particular. While more moderate in recent years, these patterns of discrimination persist. They do so even though farmers comprise a political majority. Rather than claiming the existence of a single best approach to the analysis of policy choice, the authors explore the impact of three factors: institutions, regional inequality, and tax revenue-generation. The authors find that agricultural taxation increases with the rural population share in the absence of electoral party competition; yet, the existence of party competition turns the lobbying disadvantage of the rural majority into political advantage. The authors also find that privileged cash crop regions are particular targets for redistributive taxation, unless the country's president comes from that region. In addition, governments of resource-rich countries, while continuing to tax export producers, reduce their taxation of food consumers.";"Bates, Robert H.

handle:10986/28167;Five Decades of Distortions to Agricultural Incentives;;This chapter begins with a brief summary of the long history of national distortions to agricultural markets. It then outlines the methodology used to generate annual indicators of the extent of government interventions in markets, details of which are provided in Anderson and appendix A. A description of the economies under study and their economic growth and structural changes over recent decades is then briefly presented as a preface to the main section of the chapter, in which the nominal rates of assistance and consumer tax equivalents (NRA and CTE) estimates are summarized across regions and over the decades since the 1950s. These estimates are discussed in far more detail in the regional chapters that follow. A summary is also provided of an additional set of indicators of agricultural price distortions presented in chapter eleven that are based on the trade restrictiveness index first developed by Anderson and Neary (2005). In chapter twelve the focus shifts from countries to commodities, and all the various distortion indicators are used to provide a sense of how distorted are each of the key farm commodity markets globally. Then chapter thirteen uses the study's NRA and CTE estimates to provide a new set of results from a global economy-wide model that attempts to quantify the impacts on global markets, net farm incomes and welfare of the reforms since the early 1980s and of the policies still in place as of 2004. The chapter concludes by drawing on the lessons learned to speculate on the prospects for further reducing the disarray in world agricultural markets.;Anderson, Kym;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-03-31;en;"agriculture;farmers;food security;rural areas;urbanization";"Urban Tenure;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28167;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28167/1/561330NWP0P09311distortions10309rev.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28167/561330NWP0P09311distortions10309rev.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28171;Would Trade Liberalization Help the Poor of Brazil?;;This paper addresses the potential effects of world agricultural trade liberalization on poverty and regional income distribution in Brazil, using an inter-regional applied general equilibrium (AGE) and a micro-simulation model of Brazil tailored for income distribution and poverty analysis by using a detailed representation of households. The model distinguishes 10 different labor types and has 270 different household expenditure patterns. Income can originate from 41 different production activities located in 27 different regions in the country. The AGE model communicates to a micro-simulation model that has around 112,000 Brazilian households and 264,000 adults. Poverty and income distribution indices are computed over the entire sample of households and persons, before and after the policy shocks. The simulated trade liberalization scenario causes agriculture to expand considerably and so, given the importance that agriculture still has for the poorest in Brazil, it has positive impacts on poverty in Brazil. The only states which show an increase in the number of poor households are Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where the bulk of the manufacturing activities in Brazil are concentrated. There is an even more positive impact on inequality. The higher fall in the poverty gap is shown to occur mainly on the poorest household groups, suggesting that the poorest among Brazil's poor will benefit more from global trade liberalization.;"De Souza Ferreira Filho, Joaquim Bento

handle:10986/28175;Agricultural Price Distortion and Stabilization;Stylized Facts and Hypothesis Tests;This paper describes agricultural policy choices and tests some predictions of political economy theories. It begins with three broad stylized facts: governments tend to tax agriculture in poorer countries, and subsidize it in richer ones, tax both imports and exports more than nontradables and tax more and subsidize less where there is more land per capita. We test a variety of political economy explanations, finding results consistent with hypothesized effects of rural and urban constituents' rational ignorance about small per person effects, governance institutions' control of rent seeking by political leaders, governments' revenue motive for taxation, and the role of time consistency in policy making. We also find that larger groups obtain more favorable policies, suggesting that positive group size effects outweigh any negative influence from free ridership, and that demographically driven entry of new farmers is associated with less favorable farm policies, suggesting the arrival of new farmers erodes policy rents and discourages political activity by incumbents. Another new result is that governments achieve very little price stabilization relative to our benchmark estimates of undistorted prices, and governments in the poorest countries actually destabilize domestic prices.;"Masters, William A.

handle:10986/28176;Inequality and Poverty Impacts of Trade Distortions in Mozambique;;Although Mozambique has considerable agricultural potential, rural poverty remains extremely high. This paper examines the extent to which global and domestic price distortions affect agricultural production and national poverty. The author develops a computable general equilibrium (CGE) and micro-simulation model of Mozambique that is linked to the results of a global model. This framework is used to examine the effects of eliminating global and national price distortions. Model results indicate that agriculture is adversely affected by current trade distortions due to policies in the rest of the world. While a removal of all merchandise trade distortions will reduce import prices, it will also raise agricultural production and reduce poverty. By contrast, removing only agricultural price distortions abroad will have little effect on Mozambique's agricultural sector. Model results indicate that Mozambique's own distortions are also biased against agriculture, with producers of processed agricultural products enjoying high protection levels. Removing these distortions causes a significant expansion of agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and a reduction in both poverty and inequality. The findings therefore suggest that removing own-country and rest-of-world distortions will have positive implications for agriculture and for the overall economy in Mozambique, and in particular it will reduce its poverty and inequality.;"Arndt, Channing

The results indicate that the distributional and poverty effects in Pakistan of a unilateral liberalization of all traded goods are significantly greater than the effects of trade liberalization in the rest of the world. There is relatively higher increase in real income and larger decline in poverty incidence in poor households both in rural and urban areas. The effects of agricultural trade liberalization alone in both the rest of the world and in Pakistan are considerably smaller than those from trade liberalization involving all goods. In both the agricultural and all-goods trade liberalization scenarios involving direct income tax replacement, real household income is raised and the poverty incidence is lowered at varied rates across all household groups except for the urban non-poor. When an indirect tax replacement is used, where the burden of replacing tariff revenue is shared by all household groups depending on their consumption structure, there is reduction in household income for most of the groups and less reduction of poverty.;"Cororaton, Caesar B.

handle:10986/28182;Why Governments Tax or Subsidize Trade;Evidence from Agriculture;This paper empirically explores the political-economic determinants of why governments choose to tax or subsidize trade in agriculture. The authors use a new data set on nominal rates of assistance (NRA) across a number of commodities spanning the last five decades for 64 countries. NRAs measure the effect on domestic (relative to world) price of the quantitative and price-based instruments used to regulate agricultural markets. The data set admits consideration of both taxes and subsidies on exports and imports. The authors find that both economic and political variables play important roles in determining the within-variation in the NRA data. Based on results the authors offer a number of data-driven exploratory hypotheses that can inform future theoretical and empirical research on why governments choose to tax or subsidize agricultural products an important policy question that is also one of the least understood by scholars.;"Gawande, Kishore

handle:10986/28183;From Agriculture to Nutrition;Pathways, Synergies and Outcomes;The report seeks to analyze what has been learned about how agricultural interventions influence nutrition outcomes in low-and middle-income countries, focusing on the target populations of the millennium development goals-people living on less than a dollar a day. It also sets out to synthesize lessons from past efforts to improve the synergies between agriculture and nutrition outcomes. The report identifies a number of developments in agriculture and nutrition that have transformed the context in which nutrition is affected by agriculture. The relationship between agriculture and human nutrition is far more complex than the relationship between food production and food consumption or the economic relationship between food supply and food demand. Expanding agriculture's purview and capacity to embrace those contributing factors and determinants of nutrition that are traditionally the province of other disciplines or improving agriculture's interface with other, nonagricultural sectors, suggest themselves as possible ways forward. The limitations of production-focused agricultural programs and interventions in delivering improved nutrition impacts have been recognized by some in the agricultural community for decades. In the early 1980s a number of international development agencies undertook programs that sought to orient agricultural production to nutrition-related objectives, and over time a substantial body of literature developed around the analysis of the programs' results.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2007-12-31;en;"agriculture;farmers;farming systems;food security;land tenure;rural areas;rural development";Land & Food Security;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28183;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28183/1/777830WP0Box370IC00January2008Final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28183/777830WP0Box370IC00January2008Final.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28184;Distortions to Agricultural Incentives in Australia and New Zealand;;In 1990, Australia and New Zealand were ranked around 25th and 37th in terms of Gross National Product (GNP) per capita, having been the highest-income countries in the world one hundred years earlier. Those countries relatively poor economic growth performance over that long period contrasts markedly with that of the past 15 years, when these two economies out-performed most other high-income countries. This difference in growth performance is due to major economic policy reforms during the past two to three decades, both at and behind the border. The report provide new evidence on the extent of governmental distortions to agricultural incentives in particular in the Australian and New Zealand economies since the late 1940s, both directly due to agricultural policies per se and indirectly (and negatively) through protection to manufacturing.;"Anderson, Kym

This chapter begins with a brief background on the two sectors, then reviews their histories of farm policy developments before reporting new estimates of rates of assistance to their farmers and their consequences for taxpayers and consumers. This is followed by an explanation of the politics behind the evolution and gyrations in farm policies in the two countries, and some speculation on the prospect for reform.

handle:10986/28186;Distortions to Agricultural Incentives in Western Europe;;Agriculture in Western Europe enjoys a degree of diversity that reflects a wide variety of soils and climatic conditions ranging from the arid Mediterranean regions to the Arctic Circle. Superimposed on this natural diversity is the complexity of different social, economic and political conditions in the eighteen countries that are the subject of this chapter. History has played a major part in creating this patchwork, particularly the different paths that countries took from feudalism to independent farming units and the inheritance laws that influenced the extent to which land ownership was transmitted from generation to generation. Average farm size varies considerably in the countries of Western Europe, in turn reflecting the relative political and social importance of landowners and small farmers. By the late nineteenth century, these various factors had determined a structure of farming in the Western European region that is still visible today. Productivity growth in Western Europe's agricultural sector compared favorably with that in the manufacturing sector in the immediate post-war period. Over the period 1949 to 1959, by which time the economy had largely recovered from the war-time disruptions, output per person in agriculture had increased by more than that in manufacturing in most of the countries in Western Europe. The productivity growth was a combination of output increases as a result of mechanization and modernization, and the outflow of labor as other sectors absorbed rural workers.;Josling, Tim;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-09-30;en;"agriculture;farmers;food security;rural areas";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;"150;143";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28186;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28186/1/561430NWP0West10Western1Europe10908.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28186/561430NWP0West10Western1Europe10908.pdf.jpg?sequence=17&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28189;Distortions to Agricultural Incentives in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan;;The story of agricultural policy in Northeast Asia over the past 50 years illustrates the dramatic changes that can occur in distortions to agricultural incentives faced by producers and consumers at different stages of economic development. In this study of Japan, the Republic of Korea (the southern part of the peninsula, hereafter referred to as Korea) and the island of Taiwan, China (hereafter referred to as Taiwan), the authors estimate the degree of distortions for key agricultural products as well as for the agricultural sector as a whole over a period when these economies transitioned from low- or middle- to high-income status the beginning of the so-called East Asian economic miracle of dramatic industrial development. The three economies in terms of the nature of their economies, including their resource endowments that determined the course of their modern economic growth and development. The evolution of agricultural policies in the three economies is then reviewed before discussing how to measure distortions to agricultural incentives using the methodology from Anderson et al. (2008), the focus of which is on nominal and relative rates of assistance. Implications of empirical findings for policy reforms in the three economies are discussed in the final section, where the authors also identify lessons for later-developing economies experiencing similar structural transformations in the course of their economic growth. Statistical observations are found to be consistent with the hypothesis that the success of rapid industrialization that advanced these economies to the middle-income stage resulted in declines in agriculture's comparative advantage associated with the growing income disparity between farmers and employees in non-agricultural sectors.;"Honma, Masayoshi

handle:10986/28190;Distortions to Agricultural Incentives in Latin America and the Caribbean;;"This study on Latin America is based on a sample of eight countries, comprising the big four economies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico; Colombia and Ecuador, two of the poorest South American tropical countries; the Dominican Republic, the largest Caribbean economy; and Nicaragua, the poorest country in Central America. Together, in 2000-04, these countries accounted for 78 percent of the region's population, 80 percent of the region's agricultural value added, and 84 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of Latin America. The key characteristics of these economies-which account for only 4.5 percent of worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but 7.7 percent of agricultural value added and more than 10 percent of agricultural and food exports. The table reveals the considerable diversity within the region in terms of stages of development, relative resource endowments, comparative advantages and, hence, trade specialization, and the incidence of poverty and income inequality. This means that these countries represent a rich sample for comparative study. Nicaragua's per capita income is only one-seventh the global average, while the incomes of Colombia and Ecuador are one-third of this average. By contrast, the per capita incomes of Argentina and Chile average just one-eighth below and that of Mexico is one eighth above the global average. Only Argentina, Brazil, and Nicaragua are well above the global average in endowments of agricultural land per capita; the Dominican Republic and Ecuador are well below this average; and Chile, Colombia, and Mexico are a little less than one-third above the average.";"Anderson, Kym

The chapter then summarizes estimates of the nominal rate of assistance (NRA) and the relative rate of assistance (RRA) to farmers delivered by national farm and nonfarm policies over the past several decades, as well as the impact of these policies on the consumer prices of farm products, using the project's methodology (Anderson et al. 2008).

handle:10986/28194;General Equilibrium Effects of Price Distortions on Global Markets, Farm Incomes and Welfare;;Earnings from farming in many developing countries have been depressed by a pro-urban bias in own-country policies as well as by governments of richer countries favoring their farmers with import barriers and subsidies. Both sets of policies, which reduce national and global economic welfare and contribute to global inequality and poverty, have been undergoing reform since the 1980s. Using the linkage model of the global economy and modifications to the pre-release of version 7 of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) protection database for 2004, this paper seeks to compare the effect of those reforms to date with those that would come from removing remaining agricultural and trade policies. Two sets of results are thus presented: one showing the effects of policy reforms between 1980-84 and 2004, the other showing what the removal of remaining distortions as of 2004 could be. Both sets of results indicate improvements in the real value of agricultural output and exports, the real returns to farm land and unskilled labor, and real net farm incomes in most developing country regions despite the adverse effect on the international terms of trade for some developing countries that are net food importers or are enjoying preferential access to agricultural markets of high-income countries. Landowners in those high-income countries still offering their farmers price supports could readily afford to compensate them from the benefits of removing remaining agricultural protectionism.;"Valenzuela, Ernesto

handle:10986/28198;The Quality of Growth;Fiscal Policies for Better Results;The world faces unprecedented opportunities to reduce global poverty and improve human welfare. Strong global growth and better economic policies in recent years have substantially reduced poverty in many developing countries. However, with the recent financial turmoil in the United States and rising prices for food, oil, and other commodities, the world economy faces heightened risks and volatility. Policymakers around the world face the challenge of maintaining momentum in growth, as well as of improving the quality of growth. This concern over quality is reflected in the highly uneven reduction in poverty, rising inequality in numerous countries, and widening environmental degradation during the past decade, a period of unprecedented high economic growth in developing countries. Unless these issues are confronted, gains from growth are likely to be undermined and the pace of growth, itself, will not be sustained. Growth is clearly linked to reductions in poverty. But the strength of this relationship depends on the quality or nature of growth. Various studies show that some growth patterns systematically reduce poverty and inequality, but others do not. And some growth patterns lead to underinvestment in human capital, overexploitation of natural resources, and degradation of the environment, patterns inimical to the sustainability of growth.;"López, Ramón E.

handle:10986/28199;Assessing the Environmental, Forest, and Other Natural Resource Aspects of Development Policy Lending;A World Bank Toolkit;"The operations policy on Development Policy Lending (DPL), approved by the Board in August 2004, requires that the Bank systematically analyze whether specific country policies supported by an operation are likely to have ""significant effects"" on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources. The implicit objective behind this requirement is to ensure that there is adequate capacity in the country to deal with adverse effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources that the policies could trigger, even at the program design stage. DPL operations are associated with a whole array of policies such as macro policy reforms, fiscal policies, and specific sectoral policies, particularly in key sectors such as agriculture, health and education, energy, etc. In some cases, the operation may deal directly with reforms in certain environmentally sensitive sectors such as energy, transport, water and sanitation, agriculture, and forestry. In these cases, there is an obvious need for careful analysis of environmental, natural resource, and forestry impacts. In other cases, such as public sector reform and governance, there is less potential for likely significant impacts on the natural environment and natural resources. The toolkit is designed to be concise and user-friendly. It consists of three specific modules. The first module identifies relevant transmission channels through which the proposed reform would have a likely effect on the identified environmental, forest, and other natural resource priorities. The second module provides assistance in identifying key environmental issues in the country, regions, or sectors likely to be influenced by the DPL program. The third module presents different tools and methodologies for rapid assessment of the likely significant effects of each reform.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-12-31;en;"capacity building;climate change;deforestation;fisheries;forestry;land degradation;land tenure;land use;local community;natural disasters;property rights;rural development;rural population;sustainable development;urban areas;waste;water management";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28199;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28199/1/561680WP0Box341IC10WBDPLTooklitCRA1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28199/561680WP0Box341IC10WBDPLTooklitCRA1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

This handbook is primarily designed for policy makers and tax practitioners. The goal is to analyze the impact of income tax, the value added tax (VAT), and other local taxes that are imposed on business. This handbook does not analyze the effects of trade and labor taxes such as social security. The administration of the customs duty is unique and has been addressed extensively in the literature on customs modernization. Labor taxes primarily imposed on salaried individuals are not covered by this handbook, even though their incidence affects business. VAT has been included even though it is a tax on consumption because the administrative burden to comply with it is primarily on business.;;"International Finance Cooperation;Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency;World Bank Group";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-12-31;en;"capacity building;expropriation";;;;"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28206;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28206/1/588150WP0FIAS110BOX353820B01PUBLIC1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28206/588150WP0FIAS110BOX353820B01PUBLIC1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/28239;Poverty Assessment for Bangladesh;Creating Opportunities and Bridging the East-West Divide;Bangladesh has made good progress in reducing poverty over the past decade despite the series of external shocks which have routinely affected the country. Poverty fell from 49 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2005, propelled by respectable economic growth and relatively stable inequality. These statistics are reflected in tangible improvements in poor people's lives, such as a sharp reduction in those living under flimsy straw roofs in rural areas. Unfortunately, climatic shocks such as the 2007 floods and cyclone, as well as rising food prices, have slowed the country's progress in reducing poverty. Despite these setbacks we expect that Bangladesh will reach its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. Poverty reduction is not just about improving household income, but also about enhancing human capability. Our optimism in Bangladesh's future is also based on its significant gains in human development over the past 15 years. Despite its recent progress in reducing poverty, Bangladesh remains a poor country with about 56 million poor people in 2005 and continuing disparities across occupational groups, gender, and regions. Although growing regional inequality is characteristic of many developing countries experiencing rapid economic growth, Bangladesh is somewhat unique in that the natural boundaries created by its rivers limit integration between economically unequal geographic areas. This report shows that higher productivity in agriculture, job creation in urban growth poles and promoting migration will be essential for further poverty reduction across Bangladesh. Sustaining this reduction will require maintaining the progress made thus far in slowing population growth, and providing better quality options in schooling and healthcare. Another urgent priority is to better coordinate the country's existing safety net system in order to expand effective programs in line with the needs of the poor.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-10-31;en;"farmers;land ownership;natural disasters;rural areas;rural population;urban areas";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;"BGD;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28239;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28239/1/731470NWP0BanglaPD0Box371940B00PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28239/731470NWP0BanglaPD0Box371940B00PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28243;Improving the Business Environment in Latvia;The Impact of FIAS Assistance;This paper tracks the process through which FIAS, the investment climate advisory service of the World Bank Group advised the government of Latvia from 1998 to 2004 on ways to improve the business environment, achieve higher rates of economic growth, and thereby alleviate poverty. This case study shows that it is reasonable to describe how assistance by FIAS led to an improved business environment. The role that FIAS advice played may be discerned at the level of benefits accruing to the target population (i.e., the amount of resources freed up by lower costs associated with administrative procedures). Whether these benefits accruing to the business community translated into higher rates of investment and productivity, and thus to higher economic growth and reduced poverty, is a function of the entire political, social, and economic structure in Latvia. It is evident that there are many links in the chain of causation, and that the direct attribution FIAS can claim diminishes at every step downstream from its activities. Credit for success must be shared with the Government of Latvia and its immediate stakeholders (i.e., the businesses and their associations), the European Union accession process, the input of many other complementary projects, market forces, and fortuitous timing.;"Liepina, Sanda

handle:10986/28252;Scaling up Local and Community Driven Development;A Real World Guide to Its Theory and Practice;Local and Community Driven Development (LCDD) is an approach that gives control of development decisions and resources to community groups and representative local governments. Poor communities receive funds, decide on their use, plan and execute the chosen local projects, and monitor the provision of services that result from it. It improves not just incomes but people's empowerment and governance capacity, the lack of which is a form of poverty as well. LCDD operations have demonstrated effectiveness at delivering results and have received substantial support from the World Bank. Since the start of this decade, our lending for LCDD has averaged around US$2 billion per year. Through its support to local and community-driven programs, the Bank has financed services such as water supply and sanitation, health services, schools that are tailored to community needs and likely to be maintained and sustainable, nutrition programs for mothers and infants, the building of rural access roads, and support for livelihoods and micro enterprise. This eBook brings together the thoughts and experiences of many of the leading proponents and practitioners of LCDD, a phrase that evolved from Community-Driven Development, and most clearly describes the process of empowering communities and their local governments so they drive economic and social development upwards and outwards. This, too many, appears as a new paradigm, though it has actually evolved over the decades, since it emerged from India in the 1950s. While many LCDD projects have taken root, the key challenge now is how such islands of success, that is, the discrete LCDD projects, can be scaled up into sustainable national programs that build skills in decision-making, management, and governance.;"Binswanger-Mkhize, Hans P.

Mining, infrastructure development and tourism development, in particular, are undergoing rapid expansion, and all pose risks to Mongolia's globally important biodiversity. In order to strengthen its safeguard review process in Mongolia, specifically implementation of its operational policy on natural habitats, the World Bank contracted Birdlife Asia to identify important areas of natural habitat in the country, and assess the extent to which these areas overlap with development plans. Birdlife Asia undertook this study in close collaboration with the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center (WSCC) of Mongolia. The study looked at the extent of overlap between sites of conservation importance on the one hand, and mining licenses, major infrastructure plans, and tourist camp locations on the other. It determined the scale of overlap at the national level, provided a strategic overview of potential impacts, and identified particular sites where there is cause for concern. Recommendations were made for how environmental issues arising might be addressed, including examples of guidance and best practice from outside of Mongolia.;BirdLife Asia;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-01-31;en;"agriculture;extractive industries;forestry;land degradation;land management;nature reserves;protected areas;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;009;MNG";"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28253;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28253/1/583660WP01publ11important1areas1ENG.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28253/583660WP01publ11important1areas1ENG.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28274;The Role of Local Institutions in Adaptation to Climate Change;;This review focuses on the role of local institutions in adaptation to climate change. It does so under the belief that climate impacts will affect disadvantaged social groups more disproportionately, and that local institutions centrally influence how different social groups gain access to and are able to use assets and resources. It suggests that adaptation to climate change is inevitably local and that institutions influence adaptation and climate vulnerability in three critical ways: a) they structure impacts and vulnerability, b) they mediate between individual and collective responses to climate impacts and thereby shape outcomes of adaptation, and c) they act as the means of delivery of external resources to facilitate adaptation, and thus govern access to such resources. In focusing on local institutions, the review fills two glaring gaps in the existing understanding about institutions and climate change: the lack of middle-range theories of adaptation practices to help frame policy debates, and the absence of comparative empirical studies of adaptation to support policy interventions. To contribute to middle-range theoretical knowledge about climate change the review develops a conceptual framework to understand and classify the adaptation practices of the rural poor, view the institutional structuring of adaptation, and examine the types of external support interventions that local institutions inevitably channel. The review proposes a focus on different forms of mobility, storage, diversification, communal pooling, and market exchange in rural settings as the basic mechanisms through which households address riskiness of livelihoods. Using the familiar typology of public, private, and civil society institutions the review proposes an institutional linkages framework that highlights the role of institutional partnerships in facilitating adaptation and drawing from social network analysis it presents a conceptual toolkit to analyze institutional partnerships and their impacts on resource access of vulnerable social groups. In examining the role of institutions in channeling financial, information and technological, leadership, and policy interventions into rural areas, the review highlights that institutions are critical leverage points through which to determine the direction and magnitude of flows of resources to different social groups.;Agrawal, Arun;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-03-05;en;"capacity building;land degradation;land use;property rights";Land, Climate change & Environment;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28274;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28274/1/691280WP0P11290utions0in0adaptation.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28274/691280WP0P11290utions0in0adaptation.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28276;Gender Analysis of Aquaculture Value Chain in Northeast Vietnam and Nigeria;;The report is an initiative of the Agriculture and Rural Development Department (ARD) of the World Bank. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector in the world and is expected to contribute more than 50 percent of total fish consumption by 2020. Just over 90 percent of aquaculture production originates in Asia, and nearly 70 percent in China alone. Efforts to expand aquaculture production to meet the ever increasing worldwide demand for seafood continue. Although the boom in international demand for shrimp has drawn attention to this sector, the development potential of aquaculture stems partly from the variety of products, production systems, and scales of production it covers. In comparison with the dominance of large-scale coastal aquaculture systems in Latin America, North America, and Europe, the vast majority of aquaculture production in Asia is carried out in rural areas, is integrated into existing farming systems, takes places on a small scale, depends on the cooperation of family members, and involves large numbers of the rural population. Aquaculture is a promising business venture in many contexts, and the private sector drives and plays a major role in this. The aim of this study is to guide two potential World Bank operations in Vietnam and Nigeria with the aquaculture value chain as their focus. This paper describes the specific contexts of Vietnam and Nigeria and recommends concrete project entry points and actions for gender integration, applying the lessons learned from past experiences.;"Veliu, Atdhe

handle:10986/28279;Joint MDB Report to the G8 on the Implementation of the Clean Energy Investment Framework and Their Climate Change Agenda Going Forward;;The 2005 Gleneagles G8 summit in July 2005 stimulated a concerted effort of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to broaden and accelerate programs on access to energy and climate change mitigation and adaptation through the Clean Energy Investment Framework (CEIF). At the Gleneagles summit, it was agreed that a report on the implementation of the CEIF would be prepared for the 2008 G8 (Group of Eight: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) summit hosted by Japan. This joint report of the MDBs to the G8 summit in Hokkaido is intended to provide information on the outcomes and lessons learned under the CEIF, describe the collective MDB objectives for addressing the energy access and climate change challenges, and outline how the MDBs plan to build on the CEIF experience to date to more fully achieve these objectives. The report builds upon the 'the MDBs and the climate change agenda' report that was presented at the December 2007 Bali climate change conference. This report describes actions taken by each MDB to develop climate change strategies and programs of actions tailored to their particular client needs, based on resources and funding mechanisms currently available. Under the CEIF, the MDBs have strengthened collaboration on analytical work and programming and committed to expand this collaboration to optimize the impact of their collective actions. In addition to reporting on the status of the CEIF, this report outlines the collective ambition of the MDBs with respect to assisting the developing countries in meeting the climate change challenge, summarizes their evolving strategies designed to meet these objectives and the mechanisms through which they intend to achieve the necessary collaboration to optimize the collective impact of their climate change interventions.;;"African Development Bank;Asian Development Bank;European Bank for Reconstruction and Development;European Investment Bank;Inter-American Development Bank;World Bank Group";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2008-06-30;en;"climate change;forest conservation;forest law;land use;transaction costs";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";;"Reports & Research;Policy Papers & Briefs";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28279;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28279/1/639210WP0Joint00Box0361531B0PUBLIC0.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28279/639210WP0Joint00Box0361531B0PUBLIC0.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/28291;Philippines Mindanao Jobs Report;A Strategy for Mindanao Regional Development;"This report adds value because its inclusive approach of engaging with a broad-based group of stakeholders at the time of both analysis and engagement has served a means of building support for needed reforms. The goal was to generate ownership among Mindanawons through consultations which were guided by mostly local technical experts. For the analysis, the World Bank partnered with leading universities, think tanks, experts, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Some 90 percent of the extended team came from within Mindanao, and they contributed more than 40 background papers. The study’s inclusive approach was to listen intently to government, business, labor, civil society, and vulnerable groups who are often left out in the engagement process, such as indigenous people, Moro women, out-of-school youth, combatants, and internally displaced people. From January 2015 to June 2016, some 1,500 stakeholders were consulted. Finally, 10 eminent individuals with government, business, labor, and civil society experience provided strategic advice to the report team. Finally, building on the dialogue with the Philippine government and stakeholders in Mindanao, this report proposes a strategy for regional development in Mindanao. The three main components are to (1) raise agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2) boost human development; and (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility and strengthen institutions in ARMM and conflict-affected areas. The World Bank engagement for Mindanao will be based on this strategy. Policy recommendations are made in four separate categories: (1) increasing agricultural productivity by improving extension and irrigation services, along with price reforms to realize Mindanao’s agriculture potential; (2) building up logistics and transport connectivity by improving road networks and the efficiency of shipping services to reduce trade costs; (3) improving the supply of reliable power and the speed, affordability ,and quality of information and communications technology (ICT) services by fostering competition; and (4) supporting private investment by addressing the growing skills gap, the high regulatory burden for businesses, and by improving financial inclusion and the governance of land.

handle:10986/28318;Using Commodities as Collateral for Finance (Commodity-Backed Finance);;"In most emerging markets, the lack of acceptable collateral is often cited as a key constraint on the provision of credit to agriculture. Three main types of collateral are typically used to finance agriculture: farmland, equipment, and agricultural commodities. In many economies, however, the ability to use farmland as collateral is hindered by the absence of land titles or by inefficient land markets. Likewise, mortgaging or leasing out equipment is not always possible due to the lack of mechanization in agriculture, the absence of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to leasing, or limited secondary markets for equipment in case of default. As a result, the third option, use of agricultural commodities as collateral, is increasingly being explored in various countries, particularly in Latin America, South Asia, and East Africa, where financial institutions have developed credit products that use commodities as collateral for lending. Such agricultural commodities have an established value and market where quick liquidation mechanisms can in theory provide sufficient funds to cover a loan extended against them in case of a default. Overall, commodity-backed finance using agricultural inventories is an important component of a holistic approach to making agricultural credit and professional storage more accessible. In turn, more accessible credit and storage can contribute to food security by: (1) increasing local food processing capacity; (2) reducing post-harvest losses;2 (3) improving the quality of the goods stored under better conditions; and (4) potentially improving incomes for farmers (through a combination of lower postharvest losses and better prices from delayed marketing).";"Varangis, Panos

handle:10986/28333;Nepal;Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity;Agriculture contributes about 35 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Nepal. But growth in the sector has been quite volatile in the last decade, tothe extent that the lowest and highest growth rates were recorded in consecutive years. Nepal agriculture is characterized by relatively low yields compared to neighboring countries. Furthermore,land is disproportionately allocated to grain staples (rice, maize, wheat, millet, barley, and buckwheat),despite fruits and vegetables showing relatively higher yields and higher growth in consumption. A proper understanding of the sources of agriculture growth would help identify what kind of agriculture offers most potential to further reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity.Nepal is increasingly becoming a net importer of food, both in high value foods such asfruits and vegetables as well as staples such as rice, potatoes, and maize. Expanding exports would require investments in infrastructure and a conducive regulatory environment to certify that products from Nepal achieve the various Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary standards of foreign markets. The main objective of this report is to identify policy and investment priorities to stimulate agricultural growth for poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The study ultimately seeks to inform strategic dialogue between Government of Nepal and the World Bank Group towards investments inagriculture and supporting sectors. The report provides building blocks to identify policy andinvestments priorities. After a brief Introduction, Chapter 2 examines the main drivers of agriculturefor poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The key issues addressed are drivers of agricultural income, drivers of total factor productivity growth, emerging patterns of diversification, degree of mechanization, and constraints to investments in the sector. Chapter 3 examines the effects of public expenditures in fertilizer and seed distribution programs, paying specific attention to effects on: supply of fertilizers, fertilizer application rates, retail prices, private sector participation, performance of the distribution chain, relative access between various categories of farmers, and consistency of the program with inequalities in the distribution of poverty and food and nutritional security. Chapter 4 generates lessons on policy and investments to expand exports. Chapter 5 generates lessons on policy and investments to substitute imports. Chapter 6 provides overall recommendations for policy and investments priorities, while distinguishing between actions needed to stimulate broad-based productivity growth with actions need for export promotion and import substitution.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2016-12-01;en;agriculture;;;"NPL;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28333;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28333/1/ACS18679-REVISED-Final-Report-Nepal-Sources-of-Growth-in-Agriculture-for-Poverty-Redu.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28333/ACS18679-REVISED-Final-Report-Nepal-Sources-of-Growth-in-Agriculture-for-Poverty-Redu.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

(referred to throughout this document as PVH) came to leada group of its top suppliers to build factories and a fabric mill in Ethiopia’s Hawassa IndustrialPark (HIP) is the study of a strong collaboration between a private company looking to optimizeits business model and a government aiming to transform its economy through global strategic repositioning. The success of this story hinges upon the intersection of their goals and a shared vision of development that includes a strong commitment to social and environmental goals.PVH was motivated to invest in Ethiopia to respond to shifts in the global apparel sector, its growing desire to retool its business model and to address its concerns about compliance with social and environmental standards in its traditional sourcing locations. PVH had decided to rethink its business model and to look beyond the horizon towards a new region in which tolocate its manufacturing base. To have better oversight and enforcement, PVH moved to adopta fully integrated vertical supply chain, including direct investment in one of the manufacturingfacilities.Key to Ethiopia’s success in attracting this important investor was the government’s ability and willingness to strategically evaluate its foreign direct investment (FDI) needs and strategy and to take steps to evolve into an attractive location for higher value-added export-oriented investment.This case study explains a private investor’s site selection process. It assesses the elements PVH prioritized when deciding to commit to Ethiopia, and specifically to HIP. The case study further assesses the government of Ethiopia’s strategy, level of readiness, interest, and commitment, and sets out some key challenges that lie ahead for this partnership. The case study is structured in ten sections. Section second offers a brief background on the textile and apparel industry, including an explanation of its value chain. It provides a brief corporate profile of PVH and its current global footprint and business model. Section third describes the site selection process: PVH´s initial explorations in Africa, its consideration of several African countries, and its initial conversations and negotiations with Ethiopian authorities. Section fourth discusses the Ethiopian government’s strategy to attract and expand export-oriented investments, including efforts to bolster the country’s competitiveness. This section attempts to offer some explanation why Ethiopia was the right fit at the right time and its level of readiness to land such an investment. It provides a brief profile of PVH’s Africa point of entry, the HIP. Section sixth covers the challenges that lie ahead for this-project---potential setbacks that will affect not only the consolidation and growth of the textiles and apparel industry in Ethiopia, but also the government’s vision of becoming the “manufacturing powerhouse of Africa.” Section eighth concludes with some key lessons from PVH’s decision to invest in Ethiopia. Such lessons may be relevant to countries or regions interested inattracting FDI and may be of particular interest to other African countries in their quest to attract major investments in the textile and apparel sector.;"Mihretu, Mamo

Although 1.5 million hectares, or 25 percent, of Malawi's agricultural area is under agricultural estates, analysis shows that 70 percent has expired leases and 140,000 hectares are subject to overlapping claims. This reduces revenue from ground rent by up to US$35 millon per year or 5 percent of public spending and, by decreasing tenure security, may affect the productivity of land use. Indeed a 2006/07 survey shows large farms underperforming small ones in yield, productivity, and intensity of land use, while failing to generate positive spillovers. Recently passed Land Acts create opportunities to clarify the boundaries and lease status for existing estates as a first step toward systematic demarcation of customary estates. Failure to follow this sequence could exacerbate insecurity, with undesirable effects on productive performance.;"Deininger, Klaus

handle:10986/28418;Cumulative Impacts and Joint Operation of Small-Scale Hydropower Cascades;Case Studies for Selected River Basins in Northwest Vietnam;Increasing energy demands and concerns about global warming call for an increase in energy generation from renewable sources. Small hydropower plants represent a significant contribution to meet this demand. But the optimal use of this resource in a sustainable manner still remains a challenge. A cascade of small dams may have detrimental impacts on the environment and water use without implementation of proper mitigation measures and planning. To obtain more insight in the consequences of hydropower cascades and possibilities to improve the cascade planning process in order to reduce such impacts, the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade and the World Bank jointly initiated the study on cumulative impacts and joint operation of small-scale hydropower cascades Supported by the Renewable Energy Development Program (REDP) in Vietnam. Chapter two provides a brief background on the small-scale hydropower development in Vietnam including its current planning procedures, while Chapter three provides a description of the six studied river basins. Chapter four describes the approach, methods and definitions of the study. During the first phase of the study all six rivers were screened for potential significant cumulative impacts. The results of this screening were presented in a separate report, of which the summary is given in chapter five. This screening showed that for four of the rivers significant cumulative impacts can be expected, which merited further detailed analysis. These four rivers are Ngoi Xan, Nam Tha, Nam Chien and Sap. For each of the four detailed study cases a description of the river basin and hydropower cascade has been made, the hydrological and environmental impacts were assessed and opportunities for joint operations quantified. This report presents summaries of the cumulative impact analyses (chapter six) and draws general conclusions with respect to present and future environmental conditions (chapter seven). It also summarizes the results of the optimization modeling for each cascade (chapter eight) and provides recommendations for future planning and cascade operation (chapter nine).;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2014-02-01;en;"capacity building;climate change;deforestation;fisheries;forestry;land use;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Land Use, Management & Investment;"030;VNM;009";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28418;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28418/1/ACS8417-replacement-PUBLIC-ASTAE-Vietnam-SHP.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28418/ACS8417-replacement-PUBLIC-ASTAE-Vietnam-SHP.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

In 2004, two years after the end of the war, Sierra Leone asked the investment climate (IC) advisory services of the World Bank Group to help create a better business and investment climate that will lay a foundation for the country’s future economic growth. Answering the call, the World Bank Group’s IC advisory services partnered with the United Kingdom’s (UK’s) Department for International Development (DFID) to design a program to help Sierra Leone improve its business climate, encourage job creation, and spur investment. The result of this partnership was the removing administrative barriers to investment (RABI) program, which ran from 2004 to 2010. RABI pioneered a collaborative approach by working closely with the government, local institutions, and the private sector to implement a comprehensive, integrated agenda that focused on reforms in the following four areas: reducing barriers to businesses operating in the formal sector by simplifying new business registration.; streamlining tax administration, reforming tax policy, and supporting the national revenue authority to simplify taxes; creating a platform for effective and constructive dialogue between the government and the private sector in focal areas such as financial sector reform, access to land, and overall improvements in the investment climate, and supporting reform in those areas; and building and developing an effective investment and trade facilitation structure and promoting Sierra Leone as a vibrant and desirable location for business, especially in the tourism and agribusiness sectors. The RABI program was innovative and responsive, conducting rapid diagnostics, proposing integrated solutions, and moving quickly into implementation with support staff on the ground. The program was also one of the first of its kind to operate in a conflict-affected country, which demand specialized and targeted support solutions.";;"International Finance Cooperation;Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency;World Bank Group";World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2011-12-31;en;;;;"002;SLE";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/28421;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/28421/1/117456-WP-SL-Rebuilding-business-PUBLIC.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28421/117456-WP-SL-Rebuilding-business-PUBLIC.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/2967;Survey Report on Information Disclosure of Land Management Regulations;;Land, and its proper management, is a central issue in developing countries. Efficient use and management of land are key contributors to maximizing the potential benefits of sustainable socioeconomic development. Accurate and accessible land information is a necessary requirement for sustainable rural and urban development, which will contribute to the elimination of poverty. A well-functioning land market is crucial for achieving these goals and a prerequisite for a land market to function properly includes easy, rapid and cost-effective access to land information. Although the Vietnam Land Law (2003) aims at facilitating the development of a land market, there are still impediments to the growth of the land market due to a lack of access to land information. Consequently, land information users depend on personal contacts or approach land sellers through informal means. Therefore, enhancing access to land information is of high priority as land information is fundamental to decision-making on land investment and management. Although the promulgation of these land management laws and regulations is considered significant and substantial progress in improving access to land information, there is a lack of systematic empirical evidence as to how well the transparency provisions of the legal framework on land management in Vietnam have been implemented in practice. Against this background, this report is prepared to document the actual disclosure of land information as required by the laws and regulations.;"Anh, Nguyen Ngoc

handle:10986/3031;China - From Poor Areas to Poor People : China’s Evolving Poverty Reduction Agenda - An Assessment of Poverty and Inequality in China;;China's progress in poverty reduction over the last 25 years is enviable. One cannot fail to be impressed by what this vast nation of 1.3 billion people has achieved in so little time. In terms of a wide range of indicators, the progress has been remarkable. Poverty in terms of income and consumption has been dramatically reduced. Progress has also been substantial in terms of human development indicators. Most of the millennium development goals have either already been achieved or the country is well on the way to achieving them. As a result of this progress, the country is now at a very different stage of development than it was at the dawn of the economic reforms at the beginning of the 1980s. China's poverty reduction performance has been even more striking. Between 1981 and 2004, the fraction of the population consuming below this poverty line fell from 65 percent to 10 percent, and the absolute number of poor fell from 652 million to 135 million, a decline of over half a billion people. The most rapid declines in poverty, in both the poverty rate and the number of poor, occurred during the 6th, 8th, and 10th plans. During the 7th plan period the number of poor actually rose, while in the 9th plan period, the poverty rate declined only marginally. But the pace of poverty reduction resumed between 2001 and 2004 and there are indications that during the first couple of years of the 11th plan poverty has continued to decline rapidly. The most recent official estimate of rural poverty in China for 2007 puts the number of poor at 14.79 million, or less than 2 percent of the rural population. While there is no official urban poverty line, estimates by others have found poverty levels in urban areas to be negligible using an urban poverty line that is comparable to the official poverty line for rural areas. These estimates thus suggest that only about 1 percent of China's population is currently in extreme poverty. Notwithstanding this tremendous success, the central thesis of this report is that the task of poverty reduction in many ways continues and in some respects has become more demanding.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2009-03-05;en;"farmers;land rights;natural disasters;rural areas;rural development;rural population;urban areas;urban population";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"030;142;009;CHN";Training Resources & Tools;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/3031;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/3031/1/473490SR0CN0P010Disclosed0041061091.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3031/473490SR0CN0P010Disclosed0041061091.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;

handle:10986/3468;Gender and Asset Ownership : A Guide to Collecting Individual-Level Data;;Ownership and control over assets such as land and housing provide direct and indirect benefits to individuals and households, including a secure place to live, the means of a livelihood, protection during emergencies, and collateral for credit that can be used for investment or consumption. Unfortunately, few studies - either at the micro or macro levels- examine the gender dimensions of asset ownership. This paper sets out a framework for researchers who are interested in collecting data on individual level asset ownership and analyzing the gender asset gap. It reviews best practices in existing surveys with respect to data collection on assets at both the household and individual levels, and shows how various questions on individually owned assets can be incorporated with a minimum of effort and cost into existing multi-topic household surveys, using examples of three Living Standard Measurement Study surveys: the 1998-99 Ghana survey, the 2000 Guatemala survey, and the 1997-98 Vietnam survey questionnaires. The analysis shows that it is feasible to add a minimal set of questions to enable calculation of the gender asset gap. Adding a series of extra questions will permit a more satisfactory and nuanced analysis of asset acquisition, use, disposition, and valuation - information that is critical for policies promoting gender equality, poverty reduction, and economic growth.;"Doss, Cheryl

In most developing country cities, residents living in slums have poor-quality dwellings and limited access to basic public services and amenities. Using data from Pune, India, we estimate the residential location choices of slum dwellers, which are conditional on housing quality, neighborhood amenities, and community structure. We use these estimates to simulate the impact of alternate interventions on household welfare. We find that households derive benefits from housing quality and neighborhood amenities. While relocating households to the periphery has adverse consequences for household welfare, we show that households could be adequately compensated out of the increased tax revenue accruing from alternative uses of the vacated central land.;"Lall, Somik V.

The Impact of International Migration on Albanian Family Farming;;This paper investigates the impact of international migration on technical efficiency, resource allocation and income from agricultural production of family farming in Albania. The results suggest that migration is used by rural households as a pathway out of agriculture: migration is negatively associated with both labour and non-labour input allocation in agriculture, while no significant differences can be detected in terms of farm technical efficiency or agricultural income. Whether the rapid demographic changes in rural areas triggered by massive migration, possibly combined with propitious land and rural development policies, will ultimately produce the conditions for a more viable, high-return agriculture attracting larger investments remains to be seen.;"Miluka, Juna

With all land state-owned, the threat of land redistribution never appears far off the agenda. Land rental and leasing have been made legal, but transfer rights remain restricted and the perception of continuing tenure insecurity remains quite strong. Using a unique panel data set, this study investigates whether transfer rights and implied tenure insecurity affect household investment decisions, focusing on trees and shrubs. The panel data estimates suggest that limited perceived transfer rights negatively affects the long-term investment in Ethiopian agriculture, contributing to the low returns from land and perpetuating low growth and poverty.;"Ali, Daniel Ayalew

We use household surveys before and after the law was passed, together with the considerable variation across provinces in the speed of implementation of the reform, to identify the impact of the law. We find that the additional land rights led to statistically significant increases in the share of total area devoted to long-term crops and in labor devoted to nonfarm activities. However, these changes are not large in magnitude and appear to be driven mainly by the increased security of tenure provided by the law rather than by increased access to credit markets or greater land market participation.;"Do, Quy-Toan

handle:10986/6272;Afghanistan : Economic Incentives and Development Initiatives to Reduce Opium Production;;This report is about how to progressively reduce over time Afghanistan's dependence on opium - currently the country's leading economic activity - by development initiatives and shifting economic incentives toward sustainable legal livelihoods. Specifically, the report identifies additional investments and policy and institutional measures to support development responses that can counterbalance the economic advantages of opium. It analyzes ways to change the relative incentives between licit and illicit cropping and to help enhance rural livelihoods for the poor, under better governance and security conditions. The report puts forward concrete recommendations and the expected impacts on growth, poverty reduction and the opium economy are assessed. The report first briefly discusses the policy context (Chapter 1) and provides an overview of the opium economy (Chapter 2), focusing on how different segments of the rural population interact with it. The report then analyzes the scope for increasing value added, competitiveness and productivity in agriculture (Chapter 3) and for promoting enterprise development and off-farm employment (Chapter 4). The complementary role of further investments in rural infrastructure is examined in Chapter 5, and measures for strengthening governance are analyzed in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7 issues that cut across all counter narcotics efforts are examined. A final chapter looks at implementation, and at issues of prioritization, synergies and phasing (Chapter 8).

This report uses general economics literature as well as data collected by the World Bank and its partners to analyze poverty-environment linkages at the household level. Poverty-environment linkages are inherently dynamic and involve behavioral responses that make the identification of cause and effect difficult.

handle:10986/7275;Efficiency and Equity Impacts of Rural Land Rental Restrictions : Evidence from India;;Recognition of the potentially deleterious implications of inequality in opportunity originating in a skewed asset distribution has spawned considerable interest in land reforms. However, little attention has been devoted to fact that, in the longer term, the measures used to implement land reforms could negatively affect productivity. Use of state level data on rental restrictions, together with a nationally representative survey from India, suggests that, contrary to original intentions, rental restrictions negatively affect productivity and equity. The restrictions reduce the scope for efficiency-enhancing rental transactions that benefit poor producers. Simulations suggest that, by doubling the number of producers with access to land through rental, from about 15 million currently, liberalization of rental markets could have far-reaching impacts.;"Deininger, Klaus

The analysis shows that frequent shocks increase land market activity, an effect that is mitigated by the presence of safety nets and banks. Land sales markets improved productivity and helped purchasers, many of whom were formerly landless, to accumulate non-land assets and significantly enhance their welfare.;"Deininger, Klaus

handle:10986/7556;Assessing the Functioning of Land Rental Markets in Ethiopia;;Although a large theoretical literature discusses the possible inefficiency of sharecropping contracts, the empirical evidence on this phenomenon has been ambiguous at best. Household-level fixed-effect estimates from about 8,500 plots operated by households that own and sharecrop land in the Ethiopian highlands provide support for the hypothesis of Marshallian inefficiency. At the same time, a factor adjustment model suggests that the extent to which rental markets allow households to attain their desired operational holding size is extremely limited. Our analysis points towards factor market imperfections (no rental for oxen), lack of alternative employment opportunities, and tenure insecurity as possible reasons underlying such behavior, suggesting that, rather than worrying almost exclusively about Marshallian inefficiency, it is equally warranted to give due attention to the policy framework within which land rental markets operate.;"Deininger, Klaus

handle:10986/7690;Nepal - Country Environmental Analysis : Strengthening Institutions and Management Systems for Enhanced Environmental Governance;;"The main objective of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) in Nepal is to identify opportunities for enhancing the overall performance of select environmental management systems through improvements in the effectiveness of institutions, policies, and processes. CEA has been built upon the following three primary study components: (a) an examination of the environmental issues associated with infrastructure development, focusing on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process in priority growth sectors; (b) an analysis of environmental issues linked to rapid urbanization, focusing on the growing problems of solid waste, poor air quality, and industrial pollution, and the resulting impacts on environmental health; and (c) an analysis of the policy and institutional underpinnings related to key environmental management systems at the national and local levels. This report provides the basis for a discussion of the challenges and options facing Nepal in regard to improving the performance of key environmental management systems and institutions to support its growth and poverty alleviation agenda.";;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2007-12-03;en;"capacity building;climate change;deforestation;fisheries;forestry;land use;rangelands;rural areas;rural population;sustainable development;urban areas;urban population;urbanization";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Urban Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;"NPL;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/7690;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/7690/1/389840SR0P0786101Official0use0only1.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/7690/389840SR0P0786101Official0use0only1.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/8280;Urban Land and Housing Markets in the Punjab, Pakistan;;This note provides a short overview of urban land and housing market performance in Punjab Province of Pakistan. It describes the characteristics of well-functioning urban land and housing markets and argues that, at present, the Punjab's urban land and housing markets are not performing well. The paper identifies a range of structural and institutional shortcomings that impede urban land market performance, and then concludes by offering recommendations for making land and housing markets functions better. The Punjab Province in Pakistan is in the midst of a profound urban transition, driven by structural economic change. The Punjab is transforming from an agriculturally-based economy to a manufacturing and service based economy, which is leading to massive urbanization. This background paper reviews and assesses how well the Punjab's urban land and housing markets are functioning. The evidence suggests that urban land and housing markets are not performing as well as they could. Urban land-use planning and development controls are impeding urban development, while land titling and registration systems hamper real estate development. Systems of local resource mobilization and taxation do not generate sufficient revenues to fund key urban infrastructure. The paper notes the several critical negative consequences of poor urban land market performance, namely high land and housing prices, large and expanding katchi abadi developments, poorly located industrial estates, inadequate urban infrastructure, and constrained commercial development.;;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;World Bank Group;2006-06-30;en;"land economics;land management;land ownership;land titling;land use;property rights;public ownership;rural areas;slums;tenants;urban areas;urban planning;urban population;urbanization;zoning";Urban Tenure;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"PAK;034";"Reports & Research;Training Resources & Tools";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/8280;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/8280/1/695960ESW0P08300June0150020060Final.pdf;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8280/695960ESW0P08300June0150020060Final.pdf.jpg?sequence=4&isAllowed=y;CC-BY;World Bank ;
handle:10986/9223;The Inter-Linkages between Rapid Growth in Livestock Production, Climate Change, and the Impacts on Water Resources, Land Use, and Deforestation;;Livestock systems globally are changing rapidly in response to a variety of drivers. Human population growth, rapid urbanization, and growing incomes will lead to substantial increases in the demand for livestock products in the coming decades. Meeting this increased demand may put substantial pressure on a wide range of natural resources such as land and water. Together with climate change and increasing climate variability, these drivers of change add up to a formidable set of development challenges for developed as well as developing countries. The paper discusses the linkages between the burgeoning demand for livestock products, the subsequent growth in livestock production, and the impacts that this may have on natural resources, as well as how these may both affect, and be affected by, climate change in the coming decades.;"Thornton, Philip
