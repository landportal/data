OBL:73392;USAID LAND TENURE and PROPERTY RIGHTS PORTAL;;We envision a world in which land governance systems, both formal and informal, are effective, accessible, and responsive for all. This is possible when land tenure and property rights are recognized as critical development issues and when the United States Government and its development partners demonstrate consistent attention and a firm commitment to supporting coordinated policies and programs that clarify and strengthen the land tenure and property rights of all members of society, enabling broad-based economic growth, gender equality, reduced incidence of conflicts, enhanced food security, improved resilience to climate change, and effective natural resource management...;;;USAID;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;;en;"forestry;land governance;land tenure;land tenure systems;security of tenure (land)";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73392;http://www.usaidlandtenure.net/;;;;
OBL:73391;LEGAL RECOGNITION OF INDIGENOUS GROUPS;;"...The main purpose of this paper is to examine legal measures taken to recognize
indigenous groups and provide for their ongoing operation; the paper starts, therefore, from an
underlying assumption that indigenous groups have continued relevance to the needs and wishes
of the people who operate within them. Nevertheless, while it is beyond the scope and purpose of
the paper to explore this complex issue in any depth, it may be useful to present – however briefly
– some of the arguments made for and against the preservation of indigenous groups. In the
course of this brief discussion, the focus of the present paper will be narrowed to a concentration
on the role of indigenous groups in the ownership and control of land and other natural resources.
It should, perhaps, be stressed at the beginning that it is the role of groups as groups which is
under consideration - that is, the group as an entity over and above the individual members which
make it up...";J. S.

OBL:48899;Illegal Logging in Indonesia, South East Asia and International Consumption of Illegally Sourced Timber;;"The result of in-depth research and extensive on-the-ground investigations, the report exposes the scale of illegal logging and illegal timber trade in East Asia with a special focus on Indonesia. The report also highlights the role played by major tropical timber consuming nations including the US, Europe, Japan and China in driving illegal logging by providing a ready market for illegally sourced timber and timber products. In many of the countries of South-East Asia illegal logging outstrips legal logging, and large quantities of this timber finds its way
to the international markets either direct or via neighbouring countries which often act as laundering points. The destruction
wrought by this commercial scale illegal logging, much of it in National Parks, is resulting in rapidly diminishing forests across the
region and is pushing many species including the Orang-utan, Asia's only Great Ape, closer to extinction.";"Dave Currey

It describes events occurring in Pyay City, Bago Division, on August 3rd 2012 when City Development Committee staff and policemen carried out a nighttime city-sweep to remove homeless families. The authorities used a public rubbish truck to forcibly detain the families and then to transport them to Okshittpin Forest, which is halfway between Pyay City and the border with Rakhine State. The families were abandoned in the forest during a monsoon rain, and were threatened not to return to Pyay. Both children and adults were threatened with prison if they returned. However, the families did return to Pyay, after they encountered several problems along the way, including being without food to eat for two days, not having baby formula for infants, inadequate shelter under which to sleep, and most of the younger children became sick. Once they returned to Pyay City, the families were assisted with medicine.

OBL:61205;Papun Situation Update: Dwe Lo Township, March 2012 to March 2013;;This report includes a situation update submitted to KHRG in May 2013 by a community member describing events occurring in Papun District mostly between March 2012 and March 2013, and also provides details on abuses since 2006. The report specifically describes incidents of forced labour, theft, logging, land confiscation and gold mining. The situation update describes military activity from August 2012 to January 2013, specifically Tatmadaw soldiers from Infantry Battalion (IB) #96 ordering villagers to make thatch shingles and cut bamboo. Moreover, soldiers stole villagers' thatch shingles, bamboo canes and livestock. It also describes logging undertaken by wealthy villagers with the permission of the Karen National Union (KNU) and contains updated information concerning land confiscation by Tatmadaw Border Guard Force (BGF) Battalions #1013 and #1014. The update also reports on gold mining initiatives led by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA) that started in 2010. At that time, civilians were ordered to work for the DKBA, and their lands, rivers and plantations were damaged as a result of mining operations. The report also notes economic changes that accompanied mining. In previous years villagers could pan gold from the river and sell it as a hedge against food insecurity. Now, however, options are limited because they must acquire written permission to pan in the river. This situation update also documents villager responses to abuses, and notes that an estimated 10 percent of area villagers favour corporate gold mining, while 90 percent oppose the efforts...;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;16-07-2013;en;"mining;extractive industries;expropriation;land use;land grabbing";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61205;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/KHRG-2013-07-16-Papun_Situation_Update_Dwe_Lo_Township_March_2012_to_March_2013-en.pdf;;;;

OBL:60354;Chronic Emergency - Health and Human Rights in Eastern Burma;;"This link leads to a document containing the Table of Contents of the report, with links to the English, Burmese and Thai versions...
Executive Summary: ""Disinvestment in health, coupled with widespread poverty, corruption, and the dearth of skilled personnel have resulted in the collapse of Burma’s health system. Today, Burma’s health indicators by official figures are among the worst in the region. However, information collected by the Back Pack Health Workers Team (BPHWT) on the eastern frontiers of the country, facing decades of civil war and widespread human rights abuses, indicate a far greater public health catastrophe in areas where official figures are not collected.
In these eastern areas of Burma, standard public health indicators such as population pyramids, infant mortality rates, child mortality rates, and maternal mortality ratios more closely resemble other countries facing widespread humanitarian disasters, such as Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, Angola, and Cambodia shortly after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge. The most common cause of death continues to be malaria, with over 12% of the population at any given time infected with Plasmodium falciparum, the most dangerous form of malaria. One out of every twelve women in this area may lose her life around the time of childbirth, deaths that are largely preventable. Malnutrition is unacceptably common, with over 15% of children at any time with evidence of at least mild malnutrition, rates far higher than their counterparts who have fled to refugee camps in Thailand. Knowledge of sanitation and safe drinking water use remains low.
Human rights violations are very common in this population. Within the year prior, almost a third of households had suffered from forced labor, almost 10% forced displacement, and a quarter had had their food confiscated or destroyed. Approximately one out of every fifty households had suffered violence at the hands of soldiers, and one out of 140 households had a member injured by a landmine within the prior year alone. There also appear to be some regional variations in the patterns of human rights abuses. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in areas most solidly controlled by the SPDC and its allies, such as Karenni State and Pa’an District, faced more forced labor while those living in more contested areas, such as Nyaunglebin and Toungoo Districts, faced more forced relocation. Most other areas fall in between these two extremes. However, such patterns should be interpreted with caution, given that the BPHW survey was not designed to or powered to reliably detect these differences.
Using epidemiologic tools, several human rights abuses were found to be closely tied to adverse health outcomes. Families forced to flee within the preceding twelve months were 2.4 times more likely to have a child (under age 5) die than those who had not been forcibly displaced. Households forced to flee also were 3.1 times as likely to have malnourished children compared to those in more stable situations.
Food destruction and theft were also very closely tied to several adverse health consequences. Families which had suffered this abuse in the preceding twelve months were almost 50% more likely to suffer a death in the household. These households also were 4.6 times as likely to have a member suffer from a landmine injury, and 1.7 times as likely to have an adult member suffer from malaria, both likely tied to the need to forage in the jungle. Children of these households were 4.4 times as likely to suffer from malnutrition compared to households whose food supply had not been compromised.
For the most common abuse, forced labor, families that had suffered from this within the past year were 60% more likely to have a member suffer from diarrhea (within the two weeks prior to the survey), and more than twice as likely to have a member suffer from night blindness (a measure of vitamin A deficiency and thus malnutrition) compared to families free from this abuse.
Not only are many abuses linked statistically from field observations to adverse health consequences, they are yet another obstacle to accessing health care services already out of reach for the majority of IDP populations in the eastern conflict zones of Burma. This is especially clear with women’s reproductive health: forced displacement within the past year was associated with a 6.1 fold lower use of contraception. Given the high fertility rate of this population and the high prevalence of conditions such as malaria and malnutrition, the lack of access often is fatal, as reflected by the high maternal mortality ratio—as many as one in 12 women will die from pregnancy-related complications.
 This report is the first to measure basic public health indicators and quantify the extent of human rights abuses at the population level amongst IDP communities living in the eastern conflict zones of Burma. These results indicate that the poor health status of these IDP communities is intricately and inexorably linked to the human rights context in which health outcomes are observed. Without addressing factors which drive ill health and excess morbidity and mortality in these populations, such as widespread human rights abuses and inability to access healthcare services, a long-term, sustainable improvement in the public health of these areas cannot occur...";;;Back Pack Health Worker Team (BPHWT);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;07-09-2006;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60354;http://burmalibrary.org/docs09/ChronicEmergency%28English%20ver%29.pdf;;;;

OBL:60828;GA 2013 (68th Session): Report by the Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (English);;"Summary:
""In the present report, the Special Rapporteur describes how the reforms under
way in Myanmar continue to create the prospect of significant improvements in the
human rights situation. Important developments during the reporting period include
the continuing release of prisoners of conscience; improving respect of the right to
freedom of opinion and expression; and progress towards agreement on a national
ceasefire. The Special Rapporteur highlights, however, the dangers of glossing over
shortcomings in the area of human rights or presuming that these shortcomings will
inevitably be addressed through the momentum of current reforms. He warns that, if
these shortcomings are not addressed now, they will become increasingly entrenched
in areas such as accountability for human rights violations; the rights of ethnic and
religious minorities; the rights to peaceful assembly and association; the
representation of women in decision-making positions; land rights; and human rights
and development. Furthermore, they will eventually undermine the reform process
itself if they are not addressed in accordance with international human rights
standards. He concludes that the challenge, which has been present since the outset
of the reform process, is to achieve a transition from the military mindset that
prevails within the Government to a democratic mindset that upholds human rights.";Tomás Ojea Quintana;;United Nations;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;23-09-2013;en;land rights;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60828;http://burmalibrary.org/docs16/2013-UNGA-SRM_report-en.pdf;;;;

objective of the report is to promote a shared understanding of land tenure issues by national-level
stakeholders, with a longer term objective of improving the land tenure, livelihood and food security of
upland farm families. The report is intended for government and non-government agencies, policy
makers and those impacted by policy. The report covers four main areas: status of and trends in upland
tenure security; institutions that regulate upland tenure security; mechanisms available to ensure access
to land; and points for further consideration which could lead to increased effectiveness and equity.
Trends in the uplands include increased population growth, resettlement and concentration of
populations, fragmentation and degradation of agricultural lands, and increased loss of land to
smallholder farmers or landlessness. Declining access to land for smallholder farmers results in the
depletion of common forest resources, increased unemployment, outmigration for labor, and ultimately
food insecurity for the people who live in these areas...";;;Food Security Working Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-01-2011;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;security of tenure (land);land grabbing;land rights;land law;land tenure;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60825;http://burmalibrary.org/docs16/FSWG-Upland_Land_Tenure_Security-2011-02-ocr-en-red.pdf;;;;

In these and other regions, petroleum and mining activities have had significant impacts on livelihoods in affected communities, and on the local environment. There is also a perceived lack of benefits from extraction accruing to local populations. Therefore, several parliamentarians and ethnic armed groups have raised natural resource revenue sharing between national and subnational authorities as a key component in national reform, fiscal decentralization, and peace processes.
Depending on how any prospective system is designed, resource revenue-sharing can help address three separate issues: improving development outcomes and the quality of public investment; attracting high quality investors to the sector; and securing a lasting peace...";"Andrew Bauer

OBL:99845;The Pending EU-Myanmar Investment Protection Agreement: Risks & Opportunities;;"Conclusions: ""Widespread land conflicts and pending land governance reform, also in relation to the larger
ongoing peace process, form the key reason for opposition to the pending EU-Myanmar IPA.
As previously explained, land rights are not well established and populations living or working
on land acquired for large-scale investment projects have protested over forced evictions, loss
of livelihoods, inadequate consultation and compensation. Land governance reform is
expected and wanted, as well as larger governance reform in the context of the peace process,
although the breadth and depth of these remain unknown.
In addition to the need for protection of land-related human rights, and the need for policy
space, Myanmar at present has limited institutional capacity to implement stringent
commitments, due to which it may fail to effectively enforce IPA measures. There is limited
intra-government information sharing and coordination, which could unintentionally expose
the country to expensive litigation risks. Combined with the umbrella clause included in the
agreement, this may increase the vulnerability of host states to litigation under investment
treaties.
Ultimately, a lot of the discussion around investment protection comes down to a political
discussion about development trajectories. Like one respondent also noted, “This IPA will be
fine for Myanmar as long as it wants to continue what starts to look more and more as a
neoliberal development policy. If they stay within the neoliberal paradigm, there will not be
problems. But if one day they want to adopt massive land reform, they will run into
trouble.”164 This also explains the position of some of the private stakeholders consulted, who
emphasize Myanmar simply needs more investment if it wants to reduce poverty, and that
this larger picture may sometimes have to overrule smaller issues. In short, different people
have different visions for Myanmar’s future.
However, given the NLD Economic Policy vision of the government is supposedly “peoplecentred,
and aims to achieve inclusive and continuous development, and that it aims to
establish an economic framework that supports national reconciliation, based on the just

OBL:101019;Land key to IDPs’ livelihoods;;"This article explores some of the realities of supporting income generation for displaced people in conflict settings, drawing on experiences in Kachin, northern Myanmar, suggesting development and humanitarian actors need to better acknowledge limitations and rethink our approaches.

Since the 2011 resumption of war between the Kachin Independence Army and the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatamadaw), over 100,000 people continue to be displaced, predominantly from rural, agricultural settings, into urban-based camps with little to no access to land. Ongoing fighting and insecurity means returns home are largely impossible. Escalating armed conflict since mid 2016 and continuing today has displaced or re-displaced over 6,000 people in Kachin, stretching declining humanitarian resources further as needs increase.

Speak with any displaced person and lack of income is one of their primary concerns. But options are limited, and vulnerable to outside shocks. In the shift from farming to urban settings, making an income is difficult, exacerbated by internally displaced persons’ (IDPs) arrival creating labour market saturation. This can also create tension between host communities and IDPs, especially through labour market competition and contestation over resources, often as basic as firewood. The importance of income is about both the material benefit and improving social cohesion...";Dustin Barter;;New Mandala;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-08-2017;en;"land policies;land governance;indigenous peoples;land administration;displacement;land law;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/101019;http://www.newmandala.org/land-key-idps-livelihoods/;;;;
OBL:44988;Case study on Land Degradation of Dry Zone of Myanmar;;"According to the current land utilization, about 11 million hectares or 16% of the total land area is under cultivation. Since a total of about 18 million hectares is estimated as suitable for agricultural purposes, some 7 million hectares of new land can be brought under crop cultivation and livestock farming. In bringing new land under agricultural use, it is important that the use of scientific techniques of land evaluation and land use planning be made mandatory to ensure the suitability and optimum use of land. In agricultural planning, land evaluation sets up a link between the basic survey of resources and the making of decisions on land use. As part of land use planning, the Land Resources Information System is vital to ensure that environmentally valuable lands are not encroached upon and that adverse environmental impacts can be avoided.

To ensure conservation of the resource base, the effective programmes should be designed to address the following constraints in agriculture;

 * Low productivity due to agro climatic conditions;
 * Low productivity due to water shortage;
 * Low productivity due to soil degradation, irrigation induced water logging and salinity in dry zone...

A number of agricultural research stations and centres are presently carried out research on plant varieties, crop patterns, irrigation techniques, water storage techniques and soil analysis. The programmes and activities of those centres should be reviewed to ascertain their effectiveness and to assist in the formulation of new programmes that can address key productivity constraints...

OBL:57188;Footnote to Burmese Economic History: The Rise and Decline of the Arakan Oil Fields;;After the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886, the modern Burmese oil industry expanded at Yenangyaung, the long-standing center of hand-dug wells worked by twinza. An earlier attempt to establish a commercial industry in Arakan in the late 1870s was thereby eclipsed. On the islands off the Arakan coast -- Ramree, Cheduba, and the Boronga Islands -- British explorers had drawn attention to oil pools and seepage. In 1878, the first modern oil well in Burma was drilled on Eastern Boronga Island. However, the eager oil speculators had not done their homework, and the Arakan oil industry declined because the oil-fields were poor producers and thus not economically viable for mass production. The Arakan experience nonetheless influenced the early commercial exploitation of the Yenangyaung fields.;Marilyn Longmuir;;Journal of Burma Studies;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-1997;my;extractive industries;;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/57188;http://burma.niu.edu/burma/webpgs/abstractsVol3.html%20(Vol.%203);;;;

OBL:74239;Guns, Cronies and Crops - How military, political and business cronies have conspired to grab land in Myanmar (English, Burmese ?????????);;"As Myanmar’s junta prepared to step down from government, the military set about seizing public assets and natural resources to ensure its economic control in a new era of democratic rule.

Guns, Cronies and Crops details the collusion at the heart of operations carried out by Myanmar’s armed forces in northeastern Shan State. Large swathes of land were taken from farming communities in the mid-2000s and handed to companies and political associates to develop rubber plantations.

Our investigation reveals those involved, including Myanmar’s current Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation, U Myint Hlaing, the country’s ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, and Sein Wut Hmon, a rubber company which collaborated with the former military junta to gain control of land.

These revelations come as Myanmar’s government finalises the drafting of a national land policy, the country’s first.

The report documents the toxic legacy of these land grabs on an already marginalised ethnic-minority population, for whom little has changed since the country’s much-lauded transition to civil democracy in 2011.

Introduction:
""The Northern Triangle Temperate Forests [IM0402] ecoregion lies in the extreme northern area of the Golden Triangle of Myanmar. The region is scientifically unexplored, and the biological information, especially of its flora, is still based on the early, pioneering exploration done by Kingdon-Ward (1921, 1930, 1952). There have been no detailed scientific surveys in this area since then, and current assessments of its biodiversity probably are underestimated. In all probability this ecoregion harbors many more species than are now attributed to it. Satellite imagery indicates that the ecoregion is still largely clothed in intact forests and presents a rare opportunity to conserve large landscapes that will support the ecological processes and the biodiversity within this eastern Himalayan ecosystem.

Description

Location and General Description
The mountains originated more than 40 million years ago, when the collision between the drifting Deccan Plateau and the northern Laurasian mainland created the Himalayan Mountains, including these mountains in the Golden Triangle. Therefore, the mountains are young and unweathered; the terrain is rugged and dissected, with north-south-oriented ranges that reach south, toward the central plains of Myanmar. The peaks along this range rise steeply to attain heights of more than 3,000 m. The Chindwin, Mali Hka, and N'mai Hka rivers originate in these mountains and flow south to converge in the lower reaches to form the Irrawaddy River...";;;World Wildlife Fund;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2000;en;"environment;land environment;land cover;sustainable land management";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/47429;http://www.worldwildlife.org/science/wildfinder/profiles/im0402.html;;;;

 The Thai government is promising a ""total solution"" to the country's migrant worker population. But if
 history is any guide, the new resolution looks just like the latest rendition of previously flawed policies. For
 years Burmese migrants have fueled border industries with cheap labor, but with a recession looming the
 Thai government is once again trying to tackle a problem that has caused previous administrations to
 stumble. 

 Thai Labor Minister Dej Bunlong has said this latest registration scheme would benefit employers and
 workers both. Bunlong said employers would no longer have to pay kickbacks to keep their workers from
 being arrested and the workers would in turn benefit from both their legal standing and from the health
 care coverage they would be entitled to under the new resolution. This is the first time the government

(Hong Kong, January 10, 2012) A Burma-based rights group has released a new publication documenting and recounting the courageous fight against land expropriation, intimidation and false prosecution of a group of rural villagers. 

The 38-page Burmese language booklet, ""Forced expropriations of farmlands and partial victories"", written and published by the Farmers' Rights Defenders Network, retells the story of the villagers of Sissayan, in Magway, part of the country's dry central zone, who have been struggling against the attempts of army-backed companies to take over their land for use by factories that will produce toxic substances. 

The Asian Human Rights Commission issued an urgent appeal in April about an attack and false prosecution of a group of the farmers leading the fight against the army-backed companies in Sissayan: http://www.humanrights.asia/news/urgent-appeals/AHRC-UAC-073-2011 

Although a court convicted the farmers, the village community rallied around them, as told and illustrated through photographs in the new booklet, and on appeal their sentences were reduced to the time already served.

OBL:58694;Living Ghosts - The spiraling repression of the Karenni population under the Burmese military junta;;"Executive Summary: ""The people of Karenni State are living ghosts. Their daily survival is an
achievement; however, it also signifies their further descent into poverty and a
spiralling system of repression. Whilst this report documents the deteriorating
situation in Karenni State over the past six years, this is nothing new for the
ethnically diverse population of this geographically small area. They have been
living in a protracted conflict zone for over 50 years with no respite from decades
of low-intensity conflict and frequent human rights abuses. All the while both
State and Non-State actors have marginalised the grassroots communities’ voices,
contributing to the militarisation of their communities and societies.
Burmese soldiers oppress Karenni villagers on a daily basis. Villagers are isolated
from members of their own communities, and other ethnic groups; they report
daily to local Burmese troops about Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP)
troop movements and other activities in their areas; community members spy on
one another, reporting back to the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC);
and they are punished by the SPDC in retaliation for the actions of the KNPP. All
of these strategies create an environment of fear and mistrust between ethnic
groups, communities, and even family members. These tactics successfully
oppress the villagers, as they are too fearful and busy to think beyond daily survival.
Further exacerbating the situation is the fact that villagers face oppression not
only from the Burmese army, but also ceasefire groups and the KNPP. Soldiers
from both the KNPP and ceasefire groups physically maltreat villagers and
undermine their livelihoods. While these occurrences are certainly less frequent
and less severe than similar acts by the SPDC, they still oppress the civilian
population and undermine their ability and capacity to survive.
Additionally the presence of many different actors has resulted in the militarisation
of Karenni State. Thousands of landmines have been indiscriminately planted
throughout the state, without adequate mapping or markings to minimise civilian
causalities. The SPDC, ceasefire groups and the KNPP all recruit and have
child soldiers in their armies. The Burmese army has the largest number of child
soldiers anywhere in the world, and approximately 20 per cent of the KNPP’s
troops are under 18 (the minimum age for recruitment into the armed forces
under Burma’s national law). The increased militarisation of Karenni State has
resulted in increases in human rights abuses.
However villagers are staging their own non-violent resistance movement. They
have developed and implemented a number of early warning systems and
household and village-wide risk management strategies so as to minimise the
impact of the SPDC and other armed groups violence and abuses. These
resistance strategies have become the biggest threat to local and regional
authorities; consequently the villagers are increasingly becoming the targets of
hostilities from the Burmese army.
Most people in Karenni State rely on agriculture as their primary source of income
and are living a subsistence existence. Despite the villagers’ best efforts to secure
their livelihoods, their ability and capacity to do so is constantly undermined by
the SPDC and, to a lesser extent, ceasefire groups and the KNPP via crop


procurement, forced production of dry season crops, arbitrary taxation and fines,
theft and destruction of property and food, forced labour and land confiscation.
This is further exacerbated by the drought that has been occurring in Karenni
State for the past decade, which affects crop yields. When coupled with
skyrocketing commodity prices, villagers’ ability to ebb out a living is further eroded
– to the point of impossibility in some cases.
The abject poverty in Karenni State prevents villagers from accessing basic health
and education services. Whilst the SPDC claims to provide free health care and
education, in reality this does not occur. Health and education services provided
by the state are extremely expensive and are well-below international standards.
As a result, for most people education and medical treatment becomes a luxury
they simply cannot afford.
As a result of poverty some villagers are turning to illegal activities in order to
survive - mainly poppy production. In Karenni State there are two areas where
villagers are growing poppies with the permission of ceasefire groups. Farmers
can earn a significantly higher monetary return on their poppy yields than for
other crops using the same quantity of land. Poppy growers can earn up to
300,000 Kyat per 1.5 kilogram package of raw opium they produce (a 1.5 kilogram
package of raw opium can be produced in four months). A teacher supported by
the SPDC would have to work for 60 months in order to earn the same amount.
Additionally amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) are being produced in Karenni
State. Three factories producing ATS in Karenni State have been identified, again
in areas controlled by ceasefire groups; however as it is difficult to distinguish
between factories and ordinary dwellings it is possible that there are many other
ATS factories in Karenni State that have not been identified. Each factory can
produce between 250,000 and 300,000 pills per month. From the three known
factories in Karenni State between 9 million and 10.8 million ATS pills are being
produced and released into the international drug market each year.
Today over a quarter of the population in Karenni State have been forced from
their homes as a direct result of the actions of the Burmese military junta. Between
70 and 80 per cent of those displaced are women and children. Displacement
has increased 42 per cent since 2002 and represents eight per cent of the total
population in Karenni State. Karenni State has the highest level of displacement
to population ratio in all of eastern Burma. When similar comparisons are made
to the five countries with the largest displaced populations in the world (Sudan,
Colombia, Uganda, Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Congo) the percentage
of displaced persons in Karenni State is alarmingly higher. Over 12 per cent of
Sudan’s population is displaced – less than half that of Karenni State.
Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in eastern Burma receive very little assistance,
if any at all, primarily due to the policies of the SPDC, which severely restrict
humanitarian agencies accessing these vulnerable populations. The SPDC
deems IDPs as enemies of the state and implements a shoot on sight policy,
which includes children and the elderly. IDPs are vulnerable to human rights

abuses, exploitation and violence from the
SPDC, as well as food shortages and have
severely limited access to education and
health care services.
The most pressing need of the people and
the IDP population is physical security. Most
people have the capacity to earn a livelihood
mitigating food shortages, to educate their
children, establish a medical clinic and
develop their communities; however, they
lack the security necessary to do so. There
are humanitarian organisations working in
Karenni State, including local community
based organisations (CBOs), nongovernmental
organisations (NGOs) and
international agencies such as the United
Nations Development Programme. Despite
this presence the humanitarian situation in
Karenni State continues to deteriorate and
people are finding themselves slipping further and further into the poverty abyss
– with no foreseeable escape.
The impacts from the situation in Karenni State are not confined to the State’s
boundaries - they spill over into other states and divisions in Burma and also
across international borders, especially into Thailand. These spill over effects
include, but are not limited to: the mass exodus of people from Burma to
neighbouring countries as refugees and migrant workers; illegal trafficking of
drugs and people and associated health concerns, especially HIV/AIDS.
These non-traditional security threats impinge on Burma’s neighbours
economies and social welfare systems, affecting regional stability and security.
The situation in Karenni State cannot be rectified without genuinely addressing
Burma’s complex issues, including ethnic chauvinism, in a participatory

The 2815 km long Salween river runs parallel to the mighty Mekong River for much of its course and forms part of the border between Myanmar and Thailand. When it flows through Yunnan, it is known as the Nujiang river.

About 140 fish live in this river (approximately one-third endemic species) with Minnows (Cyprinidae) being the most diverse group of fish. The area is also home to the world's most diverse turtle community, with between 10 and 15 genera of turtles represented, many of which are riverine species.

For most of its route the river is of little commercial value, and it passes through deep gorges and is often called China's Grand Canyon. It is home to over 7,000 species of plants and 80 rare or endangered animals and fish. Unesco said this region ""may be the most biologically diverse temperate ecosystem in the world"" and designated it a World Heritage Site in 2003.

Introduction:
The Northern Indochina Subtropical Forests [IM0137] are globally outstanding for their biological diversity; this ecoregion has the highest species richness for birds among all ecoregions in the Indo-Pacific region and ranks third for mammal richness. The ecoregion sits astride a major zoogeographic ecotone, where the northern Palearctic and the southern Indo-Malayan faunas mix, allowing langurs to mix with red pandas and muntjac and musk deer to mingle. It is also a crossroads for the south Asian and east Asian floras as well as some ancient relicts that have found refuge here during the turbulent and variable geological past...

Description:

 Location and General Description
This large ecoregion extends across the highlands of northern Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam and also includes most of southern Yunnan Province. A complex network of hills and river valleys extends south of the Yunnan Plateau into northern Indochina to include the middle catchments of the Red, Mekong, and Salween rivers. Mountains in this area are composed of intrusive igneous rocks or Paleozoic limestone and approach but seldom exceed 2,000 m, and major river valleys lie at 200-400 m elevation.

The climate throughout northern Indochina is summer monsoonal. Precipitation averages 1,200 to 2,500 mm per year, depending on location, and almost all of this consists of summer rain fetched from the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea during April to October. From November to March, westerly subtropical winds drawn from continental Asia create dry conditions. These are moderated by easterly rain in southern Vietnam (WWF and IUCN 1995). Mean temperatures vary with elevation, but the spring premonsoon period is the hottest time of the year, and January is the coldest. Frost is known from the higher elevations, but it is infrequent...";;;World Wildlife Fund;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2000;en;"environment;land environment;land cover;sustainable land management";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/47428;http://www.worldwildlife.org/science/wildfinder/profiles/im0137.html;;;;

Three western oil companies -- Total, Premier, and Unocal -- entered into partnerships with the brutal Burmese miltary regime to build the Yadana and Yetagun natural gas pipelines. The regime created a highly militarized pipelinecorridor in what had previously been a relatively peaceful area, resulting in violent suppression of dissent, environmental destruction, forced labor and portering, forced relocations, torture, rape, and summary executions.

The country will have a civilian-majority government that came to office through the votes of a multitude of smaller nationality groups for a pan-national party promising political change. If this political transition is to succeed, poverty must be alleviated, corruption curtailed, drug abuse radically reduced, and a host of other social crises addressed that have long blighted our country. At the beginning of the year my son came to the Kachin state with his newly-wed bride to receive our blessings for his marriage. For the first time I began to think about becoming a grandmother, holding a tiny grandchild and then actually thinking that, at some time in the future, I would welcome a granddaughter or grandson to our home for another happy wedding. What can I pass on to this future generation? What will unfold before their eyes? Snow-capped mountains and orchids hidden in deep forests? Streams rushing downhill to join the great Irrawaddy? Flourishing farmlands?

I had a vision of reforested hills in Hpakant, travellers gathering pleasure from the peaceful countryside where camps for internally-displaced persons now dot the hills. I saw organic farmers, where today great swathes of monocultures for export have now displaced the original owners. And I could imagine thriving universities, where drug-addicted young people presently waste away their lives.

Burma’s ethnic minority groups have long felt marginalized and discriminated against, resulting in a large number of ethnic armed opposition groups fighting the central government – dominated by the ethnic Burman majority – for ethnic rights and autonomy. The fighting has taken place mostly in Burma’s borderlands, where ethnic minorities are most concentrated. Burma is one of the world’s most ethnically diverse countries. Ethnic minorities make up an estimated 30-40 percent of the total population, and ethnic states occupy some 57 percent of the total land area and are home to poor and often persecuted ethnic minority groups. Most of the people living in these impoverished and war-torn areas are subsistence farmers practicing upland cultivation. Economic grievances have played a central part in fuelling the civil war. While the central government has been systematically exploiting the natural resources of these areas, the money earned has not been (re)invested to benefit the local population...

Conclusions and Recommendations: 

The new land and investment laws benefit large corporate investors and not small- holder farmers, especially in ethnic minority regions, and do not take into account land rights of ethnic communities. 
The new ceasefires have further facilitated land grabbing in conflict-affected areas where large development projects in resource-rich ethnic regions have already taken place. Many ethnic organisations oppose large-scale economic projects in their territories until inclusive political agreements are reached. Others reject these projects outright. 
Recognition of existing customary and communal tenure systems in land, water, fisheries and forests is crucial to eradicate poverty and build real peace in ethnic areas; to ensure sustainable livelihoods for marginalized ethnic communities affected by decades of war; and to facilitate the voluntary return of IDPs and refugees. 
Land grabbing and unsustainable business practices must halt, and decisions on the allocation, use and management of natural resources and regional development must have the participation and consent of local communities. 
Local communities must be protected by the government against land grabbing. The new land and investment laws should be amended and serve the needs and rights of smallholder farmers, especially in ethnic regions.";;;"Transnational Institute;Burma Centre Netherlands";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-04-2013;en;"land policies;property rights;expropriation;land use planning;land governance;land grabbing;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61692;http://burmalibrary.org/docs15/TNI-accesdenied-briefing11-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:72258;Mangroves as protection from storm surges in a changing climate (English);;"Abstract:

""Adaptation to climate change includes addressing sea level rise and increased storm surges in many coastal areas. Mangroves can substantially reduce the vulnerability of the adjacent coastal land from inundation and erosion. However, climate change poses a large threat to mangroves. This paper quantifies the coastal protection provided by mangroves for 42 developing countries in the current climate, and a future climate change scenario with a one-meter sea level rise and 10 percent intensification of storms. The benefits of the coastal protection provided by mangroves are measured in terms of population and gross domestic product at a reduced risk from inundation; the loss of benefits under climate change is measured as the increased population and gross domestic product at risk. The findings demonstrate that although sea level rise and increased storm intensity would increase storm surge areas and the amounts of built resources at risk, the greatest impact is the expected loss of mangroves. Under current climate and mangrove coverage, 3.5 million people and roughly $400 million in gross domestic product of are at risk. In the future climate change scenario, the vulnerable population and gross domestic product at risk would increase by 103 and 233 percent, respectively.

OBL:61696;World Bank Group: Access to Land is Critical for the Poor;;"WASHINGTON, April 8, 2013 – As the Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty convened this week in Washington, DC, The World Bank Group issued the following statement:

""By 2050, the world will have two billion more people to feed. To do that, global agricultural production will need to increase by 70 percent. That calls for substantial new investment in agriculture-- in smallholders and large farms—from both the public and private sectors. 

But investment alone will not be enough. High and volatile food and fuel prices and the effects of climate change and scarce resources make the challenge even more daunting. Unless crop yields can be raised, many people will remain hungry, under-nourished, and unable to seize opportunities to improve their lives.

Usable land is in short supply, and there are too many instances of speculators and unscrupulous investors exploiting smallholder farmers, herders, and others who lack the power to stand up for their rights. This is particularly true in countries with weak land governance systems.

“The World Bank Group shares these concerns about the risks associated with large-scale land acquisitions,” said World Bank Group President Dr. Jim Yong Kim. “Securing access to land is critical for millions of poor people.

OBL:72388;Agribusiness and land grabs in Myanmar;;"Land grabs demonstrate disconnect between development discourse and practice:

""The historical weight of the political culture of development in Burma – now more commonly referred to as Myanmar – must not be discounted during the democracy-neoliberal reform era. National development discourse and practice in Myanmar has combined elements from monarchical patronage and military authoritarianism after decades of ruling military dictatorships where the military-state ‘knows best’ for its people. If ‘development’, a very loaded and ambiguous term, is viewed as being borne out of the crucible of culture and politics, then it should come as no surprise that national development practice in Myanmar has not yet followed the newly-established government’s declarations of ’disciplined democracy’ and pro-poor, grassroots development approaches.

The former dictator Senior General Than Shwe implemented his final steps in the country’s long road map to ‘disciplined democracy’ by making U Thein Sein (himself a former regional military commander) in March 2011 the country’s first non-interim civilian president in five decades. The new military-backed President is viewed as a moderate reformist leader who has been tasked to undertake many neoliberal reforms, such as privatizing the state’s stronghold over the economy and deregulating the heavily censored media. In line with democratic ideals, the President and his top aides routinely espouse the hallmark virtues of grassroots voices, bottom-up development and transparency and accountability to its citizens.

But despite the President’s western-cultural development rhetoric, Myanmar’s government continues to fall back upon the familiar top-down authoritarian approaches to development long espoused by Myanmar’s military regime that ruled the country as a dictatorship since 1962. Meanwhile, billions of dollars of western-aligned development aid and international finance flood into Yangon and Naypyitaw to supposedly support this realignment of Myanmar’s political economy and culture, but in reality is more an effort to buy geopolitical patronage.

Reflections on which different development discourses have the higher moral ground are not the intention of this critical analysis, however. Rather, this commentary articulates the growing disconnect between on-the-ground realities of national development interventions and practices in Myanmar versus the presidential and western development industries repeated proclamations of the virtues of grassroots, pro-poor development. President U Thein Sein’s first presidential speech in 2011, various government officials’ welcoming addresses at the World Economic Forum in Naypyitaw in 2013, and the long-list of high-profile national development conferences held in Myanmar have gained acclaim from the western development community for praising the virtues of bottom-up, pro-poor national development and economic growth...";Kevin Woods;;Mekong Commons;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;02-05-2014;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72388;http://www.mekongcommons.org/agribusiness-land-grabs-myanmar/;;;;

OBL:65081;Pa'an Situation Update: June to August 2011;;This report includes a situation update submitted to KHRG in September 2011 by a villager describing events occurring in Pa'an District between June 2011 and August 2011. It details recent Tatmadaw and Tatmadaw Border Guard activity, including camp locations and troop strength, and incidents related to a forced relocation order issued to eight villages in Lu Pleh Township by Tatmadaw Border Guard units on July 15th 2011. After the July 20th deadline for relocation, Tatmadaw and Border Guard forces commenced joint attacks against six of the villages ordered to relocate, including multiple days of heavy shelling and machine gun fire which the villager who submitted this report described as indiscriminate. On July 20th 2011 Border Guard troops also deliberately killed villagers' livestock and fired mortars into civilian areas of R--- village, injuring a 50-year-old woman, while retreating from an attack by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) on the Border Guard camp in R---. This report further documents Tatmadaw Border Guard demands for forced labour and forced porters. The villager who submitted this update raises villagers' concerns related to flooding along the Dta Greh [Hlaing Bwe] River during the 2011 monsoon season, and the abandonment of schools and loss of trade and livelihood opportunities due to forced relocation. This report notes that, in response to the abuses and concerns mentioned above, villagers in Pa'an District adopt strategies that include: moving to areas beyond Tatmadaw control, monitoring local security conditions, and hiding food stores in the jungle.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;17-10-2011;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/65081;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/KHRG-2011-10-27-Paan_Situation_Update_June_to_August_2011-en.pdf;;;;

OBL:65085;Papun Interview: Saw T---, August 2011;;This report contains the full transcript of an interview conducted during August 2011 by a villager trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions. The villager interviewed Saw T---, a 74 year-old Buddhist village head who described the planting of what he estimated to be about 100 landmines by government and non-state armed groups in the vicinity of his village. Saw T--- related ongoing instances of forced labour, specifically villagers forced to guide troops, porter military supplies and sweep for landmines, and described an incident in which two villagers stepped on landmines whilst being forced to serve as unpaid porters for Tatmadaw troops. He described a separate incident in which another villager stepped on and was killed by a landmine whilst fleeing from Border Guard soldiers who were attempting to force him to porter for one month. In both cases, victims' families received no compensation or opportunity for redress following their deaths. Saw T--- noted that landmines planted in agricultural areas have not been removed, rendering several hill fields unsafe to farm and resulting in the abandonment of crops. He illustrated the danger to villagers who travel to their agricultural workplaces by recounting an incident in which a villager's buffalo was injured by a landmine. He further explained that villagers' livelihoods have been additionally undermined by frequent demands for food and by looting of villagers' food and animals. Saw T--- highlighted the fact that demands are backed by explicit threats of violence, recounting an instance when he was threatened for failing to comply quicky by a Tatmadaw officer who held a gun to his head. Saw T--- noted that villagers have responded to negative impacts on their food production capacity by performing job for daily wages and sharing food with others and, in response to the lack of health facilities in their community, travel over two hours by foot to the nearest clinic in another village.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;27-01-2012;en;"land conflicts;mining;food security;land use;extractive industries";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/65085;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2012/khrg12b9.pdf;;;;

Daw Ny--- told the villager who conducted this interview that her husband was visited in hospital by government officials investigating the incident but that no compensation or redress was offered. Daw Ny--- also described arbitrary demands for food and money, and the illegal logging of teak trees from A--- village by Border Guard soldiers; she mentioned that the imbalance in local power dynamics between armed soldiers and unarmed villagers deters villagers from attempting to engage and negotiate with perpetrators. Daw Ny--- raised concerns about the lack of livelihoods opportunities, and corresponding food insecurity, for villagers who do not own farmland; she notes that, in spite of these challenges, villagers offer voluntary material support to schoolteachers and often attempt to support their livelihoods by selling firewood or cutting bamboo. Daw Ny--- notes that some villagers choose to seek employment opportunities in larger towns but strongly expresses her unwillingness to move to an urban area, believing that food insecurity would only be exacerbated by a lack of money and an absence of alternative livelihood opportunities.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;27-01-2012;en;"land conflicts;food security";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/65086;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2012/khrg12b8.html;;;;

OBL:100371;Guns, Cronies and Crops - How military, political and business cronies have conspired to grab land in Myanmar (Burmese ?????????);;As Myanmar’s junta prepared to step down from government, the military set about seizing public assets and natural resources to ensure its economic control in a new era of democratic rule. Guns, Cronies and Crops details the collusion at the heart of operations carried out by Myanmar’s armed forces in northeastern Shan State. Large swathes of land were taken from farming communities in the mid-2000s and handed to companies and political associates to develop rubber plantations. Our investigation reveals those involved, including Myanmar’s current Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation, U Myint Hlaing, the country’s ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, and Sein Wut Hmon, a rubber company which collaborated with the former military junta to gain control of land. These revelations come as Myanmar’s government finalises the drafting of a national land policy, the country’s first. The report documents the toxic legacy of these land grabs on an already marginalised ethnic-minority population, for whom little has changed since the country’s much-lauded transition to civil democracy in 2011.

OBL:55932;BURMA: A STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE;;"For centuries, that part of Southeast Asia which eventually became modern Burma
was largely isolated from, and ignorant of, the wider world. While visited by travelers
and traders from a very early date, and Europeans from the 14th century, Burma was
really only of strategic interest to its immediate neighbors, with whom it fought a
number of wars. India, China, and Thailand have all invaded, and been invaded by,
Burma at different times. As the major European empires expanded, however, and
geopolitics began to be practiced on a global scale, this situation changed and it
became more widely recognized that Burma occupied a geostrategic position of some
importance. It was, and still is, the place where South, Southeast, and East Asia meet,
and where the dominant cultures of these three subregions compete for influence. In
Samuel Huntington’s terms, it lies across the fault lines between three major civiliza -
tions, those of the Hindus, Buddhists, and Confucians. Also, at critical times, Burma
has been a cockpit for rivalry between the superpowers and, in the fluid strategic
environment of the early 21st century, its important position is once again attracting
attention from analysts and officials.";Andrew Selth;;Australian National University Working Paper #13;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-04-2001;en;;;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/55932;http://www.asiafoundation.org/pdf/wp13.pdf;;;;
OBL:75539;Land Acquisition Law and Practice in Myanmar;;"Executive Summary:
""Land acquisition issues and resultant land disputes of various types are some
of the most controversial, contentious and vexing issues at play in the evolving
political and economic landscape of today's Myanmar. Few issues are discussed
more fervently and frequently than issues relating to the critical question of land;
who owns it, who controls it, who may seek to acquire it, disputes over it, and who is
to be potentially removed from it. Innumerable recent reports indicate three
overarching trends concerning the scale of land acquisition in Myanmar: (1)
Large tracts of land were compulsorily acquired and conceded during the past
several decades of military rule that spanned 1962-2011; (2) Additional large
tracts of land have been alienated since the present government took power in
2011; and (3) Yet further large tracts of land are currently threatened with
confiscation in coming years.2
2. As the political reform process begins to slow in the run-up to the planned 2015
national elections, and as the economy continues to liberalize within a legal and
regulatory environment which remains disproportionately skewed in favor of State
and business interests, it is clear that law is incapable in its present form of
adequately protecting the full spectrum of land-related rights of ordinary
citizens and communities. In addition, land registration and record keeping
remains extremely poor.3 This is particularly so given the fact that farmers
threatened with displacement have only what are effectively user-rights.4 These
circumstances in turn lays the groundwork for potential land disputes which can have
significantly negative impacts on business activities. The land sphere is increasingly
seen as one of the most visible sectors of society where a collusion of economic and
political elites linked to the government, military and the corporate sector find a
continuing source of power and control. Arguably, given their largely inequitable,
top-down and non-transparent nature, these developments place deeper and longerterm
democratic reforms at considerable risk, and rather than constituting a boost to
overall economic performance in the country, in fact, may undermine economic,
political and social progress in this regard. At the individual company level, the
legal and political basis for land relations in Myanmar can pose the very real
prospect of land disputes that may undermine investment opportunities..."".....This entry also has a link to the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards - not in the DS study.";;;Displacement Solutions;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-04-2015;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75539;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Displacement_Solutions-2015-05-Land_Acquisition_Law_and_Practice_in_Myanmar-en-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:73078;We Used to Fear Bullets - Now We Fear Bulldozers (Burmese ?????????);;"Dirty coal mining by military cronies & Thai companies, Ban Chaung, Dawei District, Myanmar.....Executive Summary: ""This report was researched and written collaboratively by Dawei Civil Society Organizations and documents the environmental and social impacts of the Ban Chaung coal mining project in Dawei District of Myanmar’s Tanintharyi Region. Based on desk research, interviews with villagers, and direct engagement with companies and government, it exposes how the project was pushed ahead despite clear opposition from the local community. It documents the serious harm that has already been done to villagers’ health, livelihoods, security, and way of life, and the devastating contamination of local rivers and streams. It calls for the suspension of Mayflower Mining Company’s permit and operations at Ban Chaung until this harm is remedied and the project is effectively evaluated, monitored, and regulated in compliance with Myanmar law and international best practice. It advocates that local villagers should be given the opportunity to take ownership of their own path to development. Formerly mired in conflict, resource-rich Tanintharyi Region is now opened up to foreign investment, and is threatened by a flood of dirty industrial projects including the massive Dawei Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and seven coal-fired power plants. Among these dirty projects is a coal mine in the Ban Chaung area of Dawei District. The project is located in a sensitive recent conflict zone, where administration and territory is contested between the Myanmar government and the ethnic armed resistance organization, the Karen National Union (KNU). Taking advantage of contested administration and weak governance in this area, Myanmar crony company Mayflower Mining used its high-level connections to begin coal mining operations without proper safeguards to protect human rights and the environment. The project was pushed ahead without an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and without the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of local villagers. Mayflower Mining Company has a partnership with two companies from Thailand – East Star Company and Thai Asset Mining Company – that are operating on the ground in Ban Ban Chaung Coal Mining Report 2015 Chaung. Thai Asset has nearly completed building a road to transport Ban Chaung coal to the Theyet Chaung on the Tanintharyi coast, but its progress has been stalled due to a protest blockade by villagers. Meanwhile, East Star has already been operating a 60-acre open-pit mine at Khon Chaung Gyi village for more than three years, transporting nearly 500 tons of coal daily during the dry season according to local villagers. East Star has entered into a Joint Operating Agreement with Energy Earth Company, which will finance its mining operations and sell the coal on the market. May flower and its Thai partners plan to expand operations to mine for coal on at least 2,100 acres, threatening to take almost all of the local community’s agricultural land. Should it be allowed to expand, Ban Chaung coal mining would severely damage the health and livelihoods of approximately 16,000 villagers in the area, most of whom belong to the Karen ethnic group, and rely on fishing and farming. Indeed, many villagers are already suffering from increased pollution of air and water resources and land confiscations, of once productive agricultural land. East Star Company has dumped mining waste directly into the streams, causing fish to die off and local people to fall sick with troubling skin diseases. Uncontrolled coal fires, spontaneously combusting in waste and storage piles, have caused breathing problems in the community. An influx of outsiders along with the presence of the Myanmar military means local people no longer feel safe in their own villages. The project threatens the entire way of life of the indigenous Karen people of Ban Chaung, who have had their land passed down to them for generations. Although local people are overwhelmingly opposed to coal mining in their area, they were never given the chance to voice their concerns; only learning about the project once the bulldozers started digging on their land. Now, Ban Chaung villagers have joined together to challenge irresponsible coal mining in their area, and to call for alternative, democratic, and inclusive development in Tanintharyi Region.";;;Tarkapaw Youth Group, Dawei Development Association (DDA), and the Tenasserim River & Indigenous People Networks (Trip Net);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2015;my;"mining;land governance;indigenous peoples;indigenous land rights;extractive industries;indigenous lands;land use";Indigenous & Community Land Rights;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73078;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/TRIPN-2015-10-We_Used_to_Fear_Bullets_Now_We_Fear_Bulldozers-bu-red.pdf;;;;

documents the serious harm that has already been done to villagers’ health, livelihoods, 
security, and way of life, and the devastating contamination of local rivers and streams. 
It calls for the suspension of Mayflower Mining Company’s permit and operations at Ban 
Chaung until this harm is remedied and the project is effectively evaluated, monitored, and 
regulated in compliance with Myanmar law and international best practice. It advocates 
that local villagers should be given the opportunity to take ownership of their own path to 
development. 
Formerly mired in conflict, resource-rich Tanintharyi Region is now opened up to foreign 
investment, and is threatened by a flood of dirty industrial projects including the massive 
Dawei Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and seven coal-fired power plants. Among these dirty 
projects is a coal mine in the Ban Chaung area of Dawei District. The project is located in a 
sensitive recent conflict zone, where administration and territory is contested between the 
Myanmar government and the ethnic armed resistance organization, the Karen National 
Union (KNU).
 Taking advantage of contested administration and weak governance in this area, Myanmar 
crony company Mayflower Mining used its high-level connections to begin coal mining 
operations without proper safeguards to protect human rights and the environment. The 
project was pushed ahead without an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
and without the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of local villagers.
Mayflower Mining Company has a partnership with two companies from Thailand – East 
Star Company and Thai Asset Mining Company – that are operating on the ground in Ban 
Ban Chaung Coal Mining Report 2015
Chaung. Thai Asset has nearly completed building a road to transport Ban Chaung coal 
to the Theyet Chaung on the Tanintharyi coast, but its progress has been stalled due to a 
protest blockade by villagers. Meanwhile, East Star has already been operating a 60-acre 
open-pit mine at Khon Chaung Gyi village for more than three years, transporting nearly 500 
tons of coal daily during the dry season according to local villagers. East Star has entered 
into a Joint Operating Agreement with Energy Earth Company, which will 
finance its mining 
operations and sell the coal on the market. May
flower and its Thai partners plan to expand 
operations to mine for coal on at least 2,100 acres, threatening to take almost all of the 
local community’s agricultural land.
Should it be allowed to expand, Ban Chaung coal mining would severely damage the health 
and livelihoods of approximately 16,000 villagers in the area, most of whom belong to the 
Karen ethnic group, and rely on 
fishing and farming. Indeed, many villagers are already 
suffering from increased pollution of air and water resources and land confiscations, of 
once productive agricultural land. East Star Company has dumped mining waste directly 
into the streams, causing 
fish to die off
 and local people to fall sick with troubling skin 
diseases. Uncontrolled coal 
fires, spontaneously combusting in waste and storage piles, 
have caused breathing problems in the community. An influx of outsiders along with the 
presence of the Myanmar military means local people no longer feel safe in their own 
villages. The project threatens the entire way of life of the indigenous Karen people of Ban 
Chaung, who have had their land passed down to them for generations.
Although local people are overwhelmingly opposed to coal mining in their area, they were 
never given the chance to voice their concerns; only learning about the project once the 
bulldozers started digging on their land. Now, Ban Chaung villagers have joined together 
to challenge irresponsible coal mining in their area, and to call for alternative, democratic, 
and inclusive development in Tanintharyi Region.";;;Tarkapaw Youth Group, Dawei Development Association (DDA), and the Tenasserim River & Indigenous People Networks (Trip Net);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2015;en;"mining;land governance;indigenous peoples;indigenous land rights;extractive industries;indigenous lands;land use";Indigenous & Community Land Rights;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73079;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/TRIPN-2015-10-We_Used_to_Fear_Bullets-Now_We_Fear_Bulldozers-en-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:64849;Damming at Gunpoint (Karen);;"BURMA ARMY ATROCITIES PAVE THE WAY FOR SALWEEN DAMS IN KAREN STATE... ""As Thailand proceeds with plans to join Burma’s military regime in building a series of dams on the Salween River to gain “cheap” electricity, this report reveals the atrocities being inflicted on the people of Northern Karen State to pave the way for two of the planned dams. The Upper Salween (Wei Gyi) Dam and Lower Salween (Dar Gwin) Dam are planned to be built on the river where it forms the border between Thailand’s Mae Hong Son province and Burma’s Karen State. Together they will produce about 5,300 MW of electricity. It is estimated that the reservoir for the Upper Dam will stretch for 380 kilometers inside Karen and Karenni States of Burma. Both dams are located at the eastern edge of Papun district in Karen State. Once a Karen liberated area, during the last decade Papun has been the site of repeated military offensives and anti-insurgency campaigns by the regime’s troops to crush the Karen resistance. Before 1992, there were only ten Burma Army garrisons in Papun district. Today there are fifty-four garrisons, including twelve along the Salween river bank, fortified with heavy artillery. The military campaigns have decimated the local population. 210 villages have been destroyed, and villagers forcibly relocated to 31 relocation sites, where movement has been strictly controlled, and villagers are subject to forced labour and other human rights abuses. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled to Thailand as refugees; others live in hiding in the jungle, where they live in constant fear of being found and tortured or killed. In 1992, there were estimated to be about 107,000 people in Papun district. Now this has been halved to about 54,000, of whom about 35,000, or 60%, are internally displaced in the jungles. The rest have fled to Thailand or other parts of Burma. Out of 85 original villages in the mountainous area of Eastern Papun directly adjoining the planned dam sites, only a quarter remain. Most of the communities who had farmed and traded along the Salween River have fled to Thailand, and many farms in the fertile tributary valleys have been lying fallow for over a decade. Over 5,000 villagers remain hiding in the jungle, facing severe food shortages and health problems. Roads to the planned dam sites have been built using forced labour, and landmines have been planted alongside the roads. There has been no consultation with local communities about the dam plans. If the dams are built, the floodwaters will permanently displace many of the communities currently in hiding or living as refugees in Thailand. The increased military security for the dam sites will also inevitably mean further abuses against local populations. The Salween dams fit into the ongoing strategy of the Burmese military regime to use “development” projects to gain funding and collusion from neighbouring countries to subjugate ethnic resistance movements, and exploit the natural resources in the ethnic areas.

""Is there a ‘best practice’ model for the legal recognition of customary tenure?
If not, is it possible to identify the circumstances in which a particular model
would be most appropriate? This article considers these questions in the light
of economic theories of property rights, particularly as illustrated by the
World Bank’s 2003 land policy report. While these theories have their flaws,
the underlying concept of tenure security allows a typological framework for
developing legal responses to customary tenure. In particular, this article
suggests that the nature and degree of State legal intervention in a customary
land system should be determined by reference to the nature and causes of
any tenure insecurity. This hypothesis is discussed by reference to a wide
variety of legal examples from Africa, Papua New Guinea and the South
Pacific. The objective is not to suggest that law determines resource governance
outcomes in pluralist normative environments, but to improve the
quality of legal interventions in order to assist customary groups to negotiate
better forms of tenure security and access to resources.";Daniel Fitzpatrick;;Development and Change Volume 36, Issue 3, pages 449–475, May 2005;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-04-2005;en;"customary law;customary tenure;common lands;land tenure;natural resources management;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"035;MMR";Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73387;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Fitzpatrick-2005-Best_Practice_Options_for_the_Legal_Recognition_of_Customary_Tenure.pdf;;;;

OBL:75285;COMMUNAL TENURE AND THE GOVERNANCE OF COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES IN ASIA;;"Summary: ""This paper presents an overview of the distinctive
features of communal tenure in
different community-based land and natural resource
management systems. Communal
tenure refers to situations where groups, communities, or one or more villages have
well defined, exclusive rights to jointly own and/or manage particular areas of natural
resources such as land, forest and water. These are
often referred to as
common pool
resources: many rural communities are dependent on these resources for their
livelihood. In communal tenure, both the boundaries of the resource owned in
common and group membership are clearly defined. These are necessary conditions to
exclude outsiders and to secure the rights of group
members so that these rights cannot
be taken away or changed unilaterally.
Two models of communal tenure are presented in the
paper;
these models differ in
terms of the function of the state, the length of tenure and the characteristics of the
resource system concerned. In the first model, the
permanent title
model, the state fully
and permanently hands the land over to local indigenous communities for private
collective ownership. In this situation, the resource system is often multi-facetted,
comprising agricultural lands as well as forest, water and pasture land. Permanent title
for indigenous peoples’ communal land is a special
claim supported by national
legislation and by international conventions, coven
ants and declarations that many
countries have endorsed. Examples of permanent title in Asia include the Philippines
and Cambodia, where legislation provides for collective rights of indigenous
communities. In many instances such as Cambodia, Philippines or, for instance, Papua
New Guinea, the indigenous groups or communities that are eligible by law for private
and permanent communal tenure need to become a legal entity to be recognized as
a
communal right-holder by the state. This may require community incorporation.
However, the process of incorporation can be cumbersome for people who are not
necessarily literate in the national language or in
the demands of state bureaucracy.
In the second model, the
delegated management
model, the state maintains ownership
of the resources and delegates management to local
groups, most often villages, for a
specific period of time, with the possibility of renewal. Such agreements are generally
subject to national legislation only. In this case,
the resources are often uniform and
relate to, for example, community forestry, community fishery, pasture or irrigation
group tenure that all come in many different forms
with different bundles of rights.
This model is far more common than the first, with
Nepal, India, Thailand, Cambodia
or Mongolia providing examples.
In addition to these two general models, one may still find traditional customary
communal tenure in remote communities. Here the state does not actually regulate or
intervene in the management of resources, but all local communities in the area would
know of the local rules of harvesting and withdrawal rights.
Both the permanent title in communal land and the d
elegated management model may
originate from an existing customary arrangement, where the rules are known and have
been adhered to by right-holders – and their neighbors – for generations. The state can
acknowledge these existing communal systems through
formalization of existing rules
and rights. In a different situation, where customary arrangements are no longer
present and the resource is degraded and under open
access, the formalization of
Communal tenure and the governance of common property resources in Asia
delegated management of, for example, a new community forest, may imply setting up
or
inducing
communal tenure institutions, where they did not previously exist.
Inducing institutions is a major exercise in social
engineering; the resulting induced
institution must be carefully aligned with the physical and natural characteristics of the
resources or resource system and, ideally, should build on an existing set of norms in
the community. Where governments and/or donor projects have a pro-poor approach in
inducing communal tenure for natural resource management, the pro-poor targeting
mechanisms must be mainstreamed in the institution
building.
In all communal tenure systems, the physical and biological characteristics of the
resource system factor decisively into the regulatory frameworks that communities
establish. One must match with the other. In situations where both subsistence and
market value products can be withdrawn from the resource system there are also many
kinds of interlinked and embedded rights: the communal tenure is usually embedded
within a larger nested hierarchy of institutions.""
Nowadays the communities will often need support an
d recognition by the state in
order to manage effectively their common pool resou
rces. As a consequence,
communities will need to establish two sets of rule
s: (i) those rules that constitute the
community as an entity in the eyes of the state and
(ii) those that define internal rules
of benefit sharing. Whereas constitutional rules de
fine the community as a legal entity,
internal community rules establish the management r
ights in the resources and the fair
appropriation of benefits.
Interest in communal tenure and common property res
ource management has risen since
the 1980s among academics, governments and internat
ional development organizations
working on land and natural resources management. D
ebates on communal tenure are
still ongoing in many countries in Asia, in the con
text of market pressures and
dynamics, which call for privatization to increase
productivity, and in the context of
big business vying for a stake in valuable land and
other natural resources, in some
instances leading to land grabbing. The current mar
ket driven pressures on natural
resources create both challenges and opportunities
for communities and governments.
Overall, policies and institutions that promote acc
ountability and good governance
over these resources, both by the government at nat
ional and local level and by
communities, are required. Some specific approaches
, such as communities’ mapping
of their territories, are proving useful tools to s
afeguard their lands, although they are
not sufficient conditions: the wider political and
regulatory environment must be
supportive too.
Communal tenure will very likely play a significant
role in the policies and actions for
climate change mitigation. With the emergence of in
itiatives for Reduced Emissions
from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD and REDD+)
, governance and benefit
sharing of carbon finance become critical questions
in defining who owns the carbon
stocked in forest. Marketable community rights to t
his special resource unit (stocked
carbon) must be supported by national legislation t
hat favors communal tenure of some
of the carbon properties. This may lead to a separa
tion of rights to carbon from the
broader rights to the forest and land, an aspect no
t yet addressed by theoretical work on
communal tenure...";Kirsten Ewers Andersen;;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-03-2011;en;"customary law;customary tenure;common lands;land use;security of tenure (land);land tenure;forestry;land tenure systems;natural resources management;land governance";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"035;MMR";Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75285;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/Kirsten_Ewers_Andersen-2011--FAO-Communal_Tenure_Working_Paper-red.pdf;;;;

""The money I get working here is good,"" Zaw Myint said, standing in a shallow pool of water that glistened with the sheen of oil.

However, Zaw Myint's success may soon change. Big Oil is hot on his trail.
Companies from the United States, Europe, Japan and Singapore are elbowing their way into the country they turned their backs on during the past two decades because of its appalling human rights abuses.

The country fell into China's less scrupulous embrace and, for two decades, Myanmar was the monogamous partner in a loveless marriage of convenience. Western nations are moving into the resource-rich country after decades of disinterest, challenging China's interests... In 2011, fearing the country was sliding towards Chinese client statehood, Myanmar began a process of liberalising the economy, releasing political prisoners, and rebalancing foreign relations.

As Myanmar took its first baby-steps towards democracy, Western nations eased economic sanctions. Last year, Myanmar's President Thein Sein met with US President Barack Obama at the White House, the first such visit by a Myanmar head of state in almost 50 years.

China is no longer Myanmar's only suitor; she's being courted, she's seeing other people. It's complicated...

Birmas nationaler und internationaler Aussöhnungsprozess;;"Zu Beginn der neunziger Jahre reagierten die EU und die USA auf die 1988 erfolgte Machtübernahme des Militärs in Birma und die Nichtanerkennung des 1990 errungenen Wahlsiegs der Opposition mit der öffentlichen Verurteilung dieses Regimes und einer Reihe wirtschaftlicher und politischer Sanktionen. Die ASEAN-Staaten wie auch UNO-Generalsekretär Kofi Annan setzten hingegen auf eine Strategie des »konstruktiven Engagements«, die durch einen intensiven Dialog mit der Regierung in Rangun den Weg zu politischen Reformen zu ebnen versuchte. Beide Strategien haben bislang nicht zu den beabsichtigten Ergebnissen geführt.

Ausgangspunkt dieser Studie ist daher die Frage, welche Faktoren zu jener fast unauflöslich erscheinenden Konfrontation zwischen der Militärregierung einerseits und der birmanischen Opposition sowie den westlich orientierten Staaten andererseits geführt haben und welche Strategie von außen, vor allem von der EU, entwickelt werden sollte, um eine Neugestaltung der politischen Machtverhältnisse und eine Verbesserung der mehr als desolaten Lebensverhältnisse vieler Einwohner Birmas zu erzielen.

Die Studie kommt zu dem Schluß, daß die politische und wirtschaftliche Krise Birmas nur durch einen langfristigen und umfassenden Transformationsprozeß bewältigt werden kann, in dem Veränderungen der sozioökonomischen Basis und der politischen Strukturen eng miteinander zu verknüpfen sind. Von Seiten des Auslands - nicht zuletzt der EU - kann und sollte dieser Transformationsprozeß nach Kräften und in den unterschiedlichsten Bereichen gefördert werden. Hierbei müssen positive Anreize und Druck einander nicht ausschließen, sondern es wäre im jeweiligen Einzelfall zu prüfen, ob eine Zusammenarbeit möglich und nützlich erscheint oder aber verweigert werden muß.

An example of SPDC-led ‘development’ is a new dam project on the Thauk Yay Ka (Day Loh) river in western Toungoo District. Villagers in the area of this proposed dam say that it has brought a new military access road to their area and that large SPDC military columns now patrol their villages, looting their belongings and forcing them into labour. Security checkpoints along all roads in the area have proliferated, restricting the movements of villagers and extorting heavy ‘taxes’ on all goods they try to take to market. Increased military presence along the roads has occurred throughout the district, from the Than Daung Gyi – Leit Tho road in the north to the Kler Lah – Bu Sah Kee road in the southeast, and close to 300 acres of villagers’ farmland has been confiscated for the establishment of a large military base at Leit Tho in the north.

""In the eyes of the media and the general public, whether in Bangladesh or further afield, the situation of the Rohingya from Burma[ii] is usually referred to as a ?refugee problem?. Over the last two decades, Bangladesh has born the brunt of two mass exoduses, each of more then 200,000 people, placing them among the largest in Asia. Each of these massive outflows of refugees was followed by mass repatriation to Burma. Repatriation has been considered the preferred solution to the refugee crisis. However, this has not proved a durable solution, since the influx of Rohingyas over international borders has never ceased. And it is unlikely that it will stop, so long as the root causes of this unprecedented exodus are not effectively remedied. The international community has often focussed its attention on the deplorable conditions in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, rather than on the root causes of the problem, namely the denial of legal status and other basic human rights to the Rohingya in Burma. This approach doubtless stems from the practical difficulty of confronting an intractable military regime which refuses to recognise the Rohingya as citizens of Burma, and of working out solutions acceptable to all parties involved. The actual plight and continuous exodus of the Rohingya people has been rendered invisible. Though they continue to cross international borders, they are also denied the right of asylum, being labelled ?economic migrants?. The international community has preferred to ignore the extent of this massive forced migration, which has affected not only Bangladesh, but also other countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, etc...";Chris Lewa;;;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;28-02-2001;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/48121;http://burmalibrary.org/docs/Rohingya.F-M%26Statelessness.htm;;;;

PROFILE SUMMARY:
Summary (November 2003):-
""Notorious across the world for its suppression of Aung San Suu Kyi’s democracy movement, the military
regime in Burma is less known for displacing hundreds of thousands of its own people. Between 600,000
and one million people remain internally displaced in Burma because of the military regime’s brutal
policies to control border areas populated by ethnic minorities. Exposed to ongoing violence and
systematic human rights abuses at the hands of government troops, these people are without protection
from either their government or the international humanitarian community. This has affected the eastern
border areas in particular, and especially the Karen, Karenni, Shan and Mon ethnic groups. In western
Burma, the Muslim Rohingya people and other minority groups along the Bangladesh and India borders
have also suffered from the military campaign. In addition, thousands more have been displaced in
schemes to resettle the urban poor and the building of large-scale infrastructure projects. With their
traditional livelihoods ruined and humanitarian assistance blocked by the army, the situation of Burma’s
displaced people is desperate. In order to improve both the democratic process and the humanitarian
situation, more active international diplomacy, and attention towards the situation in the ethnic minority
areas is required from the UN, its agencies and international NGOs...";;;Global IDP Database (Norwegian Refugee Council);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;13-11-2003;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/45477;http://burmalibrary.org/docs3/GIDP-profile2003.pdf;;;;

OBL:75266;An Unseen Crisis;;"Summary:
""Increased troop deployment, attacks and abuses by the Burma Army in northern
Shan State during the past year have caused large-scale new displacement of Palaung
villagers, calling into question the Burmese government’s claims to be seeking a
peaceful settlement to the ethnic conflict.
The number of Burmese government troops in
Palaung areas of northern Shan State
has doubled from 16 to over 30 battalions during 2013. Attacks and abuses by these
troops have caused the fresh displacement of
over 3,000 mostly
Palaung villagers in
the past year, who are now sheltering in four new camps in Namtu, Tangyan and
Kutkhai townships. This is a fourfold in
crease since late 2012, when PWO documented about 1,000 IDPs sheltering in three camps in Namkham and Manton town-
ships.
The military build-up is clearly linked to the government’s attempts to secure its
large-scale investment projects in the area, including the Shwe oil and gas pipelines,
which started sending gas to China in June 2013. Offensives have been ongoing
against local ethnic resistance groups, in
cluding the Shan State Army North (SSA-N), the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). Burma Army shelling of villages, burning of homes and property,
forced portering, torture and sexual violence have caused new displacement of over
20 villages during the past year.
The offensives have
continued despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations between the
Burmese government and the ethnic armed
groups. The TNLA met with the Myanmar Peace Center, led by U Aung Min on July 31, 2013, in Muse, northern Shan
State, but the Burma Army launched new attacks against TNLA in Kutkhai and Kyaukmae only eleven days afterwards.
There is insufficient humanitarian aid reaching the IDP camps. Aid agencies provided basic assistance to IDPs in Kutkhai an
d Tangyan when they first fled, but since
then there has been no regular support of
rice or other food. The IDPs are forced to
find work as daily labourers to feed their families, but there is little work available.
Shortages of food have exacerbated health
problems in the camps, but there has been
almost no medical aid...";;;Ta’ang Women’s Organization (TWO);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;25-02-2014;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75266;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/TWO-2014-An_Unseen_Crisis-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:75260;How Blaming ‘Slash and Burn’ Farmers is Deforesting Mainland Southeast Asia;;"Summary: ""For decades, international lenders, agencies, and foundations
as well as national and local governments have spent millions of dollars trying
to “modernize” the traditional practices of farmers in many mountainous
areas of Southeast Asia—an agenda driven by the belief that their age-old
shifting cultivation practices (known pejoratively as “slash and burn”) are
deforesting Asia. But a new look at how forests fare under shifting cultivation
(as opposed to under permanent agriculture) clearly demonstrates that efforts
to eliminate the ancient practice have actually contributed to deforestation,
loss of biodiversity, and reduction in carbon storage.1 In fact, shifting cultivation,
rather than being the hobgoblin of tropical forest conservation, may be
ecologically appropriate, culturally suitable, and under certain circumstances
the best means for preserving biodiversity in the region. The real threat to
these tropical forests is posed by the steady advance of large-scale permanent
and commercial agriculture.";Jefferson M.

One such project is a hydroelectricity power plant that is to be built on the Day Loh River in Toungoo District. In 2005, KHRG examined the activities of 2,000 SPDC Army troops who moved into the region to secure the area surrounding the dam site. This report serves as an update of the dam situation, incorporating information which may be possible evidence of the complicity of foreign corporations, and explores the possibility that the imminent construction of this project and others like it are part of the motivation behind the current offensive underway in northern Karen State...;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-05-2006;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60654;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2006/khrg06b5.html;;;;

OBL:71528;Communal Land Tenure - A Social Anthropological Study in Laos;;"CONCLUSION:
""A developing country like Lao PDR is struggling to gain recognition from other countries
in the world. This requires that the country applies a human rights perspective to
governance of land. In this case the land rights are the rights of the ethnic groups in the
uplands that practice customary communal tenure. These groups would like the
government to accept and register their communal land use legally. The first step
towards this is in the development of the National Land Use Policy which is still in draft.
This study provides evidence-based arguments for the inclusion of a respect for
customary communal tenure in the land policy.
The field study on communal tenure in Houaphan can serve the government in terms of
integration of local land governance aspects into its development planning process. The
research has brought an increased understanding on biological characteristics of the
common resources and how communities use and manage such resources in a way that
everyone including how the poor share benefits and responsibilities to keep the
resource sustainable and thus contribute to the national land management process.
The research analyzed how local ethnic group farmers in Houaphan view the resources
that they have traditionally used as the property of their community. They have
communally organized institutions that provide sufficient incentives to ensure equity in
access to land and for the farmers to invest in enhancing the productivity of the
resource system through internal rules that assign rights to individual households,
while protecting the outer boundaries. These rules are oral internal rules. They are
collectively created, used and developed by generations of villagers. The internal rules
include characteristics of natural and social aspects and they support the improvement
of local life in terms of protection of the resources for future use.
The research has found that the communal tenure system in Houaphan is slowly
affected by legal land and forest management activities of the government, particularly
where the government does not integrate local practice of use and management of local
resources of local ethnic people.

Currently, many international and local business investors are looking at natural
resources in Houaphan province as business destination. Evidence-based research
result shows that it is necessary to protect the land of the ethnic groups to safeguard
against land loss to business activities which may be planned without considering
existing communal tenure. Many local communities will lose their customary rights to
their common property resources and the country will at the later stage have to address
more complicated political issues if local communities see that they are losing land to
outsiders.
The evidence-based findings of this research suggest an option that communal tenure
rights of local communities in Houaphan should be legally recognised along with
provision of clear set of management rules and the formation of the village as a legal
entity to fully exercise the management of the resources through an issuance of
communal titles to the land parcels that make up the common property of the village.
The communal tenure should include the fallows of the shifting cultivation uplands and
all the customary communal tenure of upland and lower land communities. The cultural
and social dimension of communal land use is a critical aspect to consider in order to
work out strategies for the future development of rural life in the province. This will lay
a foundation for local people to improve their social-economic condition and ensure
their participation in the country’s development process.
The study has applied selectively the theory of Thomas Højrup to form a macro view of
the country’s development process in the remote areas. As part of the interpellation
conditions highlighted by Højrup, the country is experiencing a profound process of
transformation. The Government of Laos organizes local societies and re-arranges land
and forests in order to transform a traditional subsistence economy to a market
economy.
In practice, interpellation does not always turns out successfully because many
economic development activities destroy a local practice that is worth preserving in
terms of livelihood and human rights of the communities. This happens in particular
where traditional common property systems are found and the systems that have
existed long before Lao PDR came into being.

The transformation means change and this change is a question that needs to be clearly
answered before communities agree to participate in the development process. Where
such change is proposed by outsiders, local people need to know that it brings to them
better results in comparison to what they already have. Otherwise they are reluctant to
participate in the country’s transformation process as they value their own customary
ways. This reveals that not only the country’s worldview, but also the view of local
people towards how communal resources should be managed is important for the
transformation. So far the local perceptions and practices of communal tenure is not
widely understood by government officers and the more studies that are carried out to
feed into the finalization of the land policy and new land law the better.";Luck Bounmixay;;Universidad de Murcia;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;20-01-2016;en;"customary law;customary tenure;common lands;land tenure;natural resources management;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"035;MMR";Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71528;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/Bounmixay-2016-01-20-PhD_Thesis-Communal_Land_Tenure.pdf;;;;
OBL:62892;BURMA: Farmers rise up at land grab by army-owned company;;"The Asian Human Rights Commission has followed closely reports in recent weeks of an uprising by farmers against a takeover of a large area of agricultural land in upper Burma by an army-owned company and a private partner. The land grab, in the Letpadan Mountain Range of Sarlingyi Township, Sagaing Region, is of some 7800 acres of fertile land, to make way for copper mining. Currently farmers of around 26 villages cultivate the land. The residents of four villages--Siti, Wehmay, Zidaw and Kandaw--have already been forced out of their homes. The grabber is the usual suspect--Myanma Economic Holdings Ltd., a conglomerate of army interests, staffed by retired army officers, along with a joint partner company, Myanmar Wan Bao. In this case the director of the project is one Lt. Col. (Ret.) U Aung Myint.

Farmers in the area began protests and interventions against the confiscation on 2 June 2012, and tensions and conflicts with local authorities have been growing since. According to reports coming daily from the region, the area of confiscated land has been placed under an administrative order declaring it off limits, and local authorities have threatened to prosecute anyone gathering to protest at the land confiscation. Their threats have so far failed to deter demonstrators: since August 24, thousands have been gathering outside company offices in the township to demand that the land be returned to them, and to object to the copper mine project. They have also raised their voices against the uncompensated destruction of crops through the movement of vehicles, dumping of rubbish and other actions by the companies that have adversely affected their lives and livelihoods...";;;Asian Human Rights Commission;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;13-09-2012;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62892;http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-STM-184-2012;;;;
OBL:98922;The Melting Himalayas: Cascading Effects of Climate Change on Water, Biodiversity, and Livelihoods;;"Abstract:
""The Greater Himalayas hold the largest mass of ice outside polar regions and are the source of
the 10 largest rivers in Asia. Rapid reduction in the volume of Himalayan glaciers due to climate change is
occurring. The cascading effects of rising temperatures and loss of ice and snow in the region are affecting, for
example, water availability (amounts, seasonality), biodiversity (endemic species, predator–prey relations),
ecosystem boundary shifts (tree-line movements, high-elevation ecosystem changes), and global feedbacks
(monsoonal shifts, loss of soil carbon). Climate change will also have environmental and social impacts that
will likely increase uncertainty in water supplies and agricultural production for human populations across
Asia. A common understanding of climate change needs to be developed through regional and local-scale
research so that mitigation and adaptation strategies can be identified and implemented. The challenges
brought about by climate change in the Greater Himalayas can only be addressed through increased regional
collaboration in scientific research and policy making."".....Keywords:

OBL:98921;Rising river flows throughout the twenty-first century in two Himalayan glacierized watersheds;;Greater Himalayan glaciers are retreating and losing mass at rates comparable to glaciers in other regions of the world Assessments of future changes and their associated hydrological impacts are scarce, oversimplify glacier dynamics or include a limited number of climate models. Here, we use results from the latest ensemble of climate models in combination with a high-resolution glacio-hydrological model to assess the hydrological impact of climate change on two climatically contrasting watersheds in the Greater Himalaya, the Baltoro and Langtang watersheds that drain into the Indus and Ganges rivers, respectively. We show that the largest uncertainty in future runoff is a result of variations in projected precipitation between climate models. In both watersheds, strong, but highly variable, increases in future runoff are projected and, despite the different characteristics of the watersheds, their responses are surprisingly similar. In both cases, glaciers will recede but net glacier melt runoff is on a rising limb at least until 2050. In combination with a positive change in precipitation, water availability during this century is not likely to decline. We conclude that river basins that depend on monsoon rains and glacier melt will continue to sustain the increasing water demands expected in these areas. [Article preview];"W. W. Immerzeel

OBL:71637;Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous;;"Abstract. ""We use numerical climate simulations, paleoclimate data, and modern observations to study the effect of growing ice melt from Antarctica and Greenland. Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying feedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold meltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and heat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface cooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the Southern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation, and increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact with the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that ice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level several meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear response. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise in about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the lower end of the 10–40-year range, but the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help explain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in controlling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global temperature and sea level. The millennial (500–2000-year) timescale of deep-ocean ventilation affects the timescale for natural CO2 change and thus the timescale for paleo-global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this paleo-millennial timescale should not be misinterpreted as the timescale for ice sheet response to a rapid, large, human-made climate forcing. These climate feedbacks aid interpretation of events late in the prior interglacial, when sea level rose to +6–9 m with evidence of extreme storms while Earth was less than 1 °C warmer than today. Ice melt cooling of the North Atlantic and Southern oceans increases atmospheric temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, thus driving more powerful storms. The modeling, paleoclimate evidence, and ongoing observations together imply that 2 °C global warming above the preindustrial level could be dangerous. Continued high fossil fuel emissions this century are predicted to yield (1) cooling of the Southern Ocean, especially in the Western Hemisphere; (2) slowing of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, warming of the ice shelves, and growing ice sheet mass loss; (3) slowdown and eventual shutdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation with cooling of the North Atlantic region; (4) increasingly powerful storms; and (5) nonlinearly growing sea level rise, reaching several meters over a timescale of 50–150 years. These predictions, especially the cooling in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic with markedly reduced warming or even cooling in Europe, differ fundamentally from existing climate change assessments. We discuss observations and modeling studies needed to refute or clarify these assertions""......

OBL:72329;RETURNS OF GRABBED LAND IN MYANMAR: PROGRESS AFTER 2 YEARS (English, Burmese ??????????);;"Namati submits this briefing paper to assist the government of Myanmar and other interested parties in efforts to ensure the 
implementation of the 2013 recommendations of Parliament’s Farmland Investigation Commission. The commission is tasked 
with scrutinizing land grab cases and to promote justice for Myanmar’s citizens whose land was taken without due process or 
compensation. 
According to the Secretary General of the Farmland Investigation Commission, as of June 2015, approximately 30,000 cases have 
been submitted to the Commission, of which about 20,000 have been heard. Of those, a small number of cases (882 or 4%) have 
been found justified to receive compensation. Many of these are collective cases, and according to the 2015 report, the 
Commission has returned about 335,000 acres of urban and farmland to benefit 33,608 families.
Namati’s own experience suggests that the number of cases justified to receive compensation or return of land should be much 
higher. We further recommend actions the government can take to help streamline the return and compensation of grabbed land 
and improve the likelihood that outcomes are fair and equitable. This briefing draws on Namati’s experience using a network of 
community paralegals trained to use administrative procedures to resolve land grab cases in Ayeyarwaddy, Southern Shan,

""Suffering from depression and weighed down by the hardships of life in Burma, Maung Maung Tinn finally decided to leave his home town, Moulmein, capital of Mon State. That was in 1994.

“I felt I had no future there, so I left my home,” the soft-spoken painter said. The child of a Shan father and Karen mother, Maung Maung Tinn felt hopelessness at not being able to help his parents and grandparents. They were helping to pay for his studies at Moulmein University, while he did his best to lighten the load o­n them by working as a clerk in a government-owned electricity plant.

Like many other Burmese, he made for Mae Sot, in Thailand, where he rapidly found employment at Dr Cynthia Maung’s Clinic, working at first as a chef, preparing meals for patients and medical staff, and then becoming a trained medic and health worker in the clinic’s outpatient department.

""The menacing group of five soldiers emerged from Rangoon’s city hall, knelt down and aimed their guns at the protesters. Tin Maung Htoo, a 16-year-old high school student, sat tight, linking arms with others in the front row.

The first shots Tin Maung Htoo heard, however, sounded like machine gun fire from armored cars sweeping round both sides of the Sule Pagoda o­n that August night, 19 years ago.

Then the soldiers facing Tin Maung Htoo and his companions opened fire, the bullets from their guns hitting the ground, ricocheting up and striking home. “Some students started running and then falling o­n o­ne another,” Tin Maung Htoo recalls. “I also ran and ran and ran.”

Among the protesters who had massed in Rangoon streets the whole day was 21-year-old Toe Kyi. By 10:30 p.m. that night, sensing a terrible climax to come, the leader of his 100-strong group asked him to take half the young demonstrators back to safety in Sanchaung Township.

One protester, Ko Naing, was doubly wary of the danger. Jailed for seven days after taking part in a march near Inya Lake o­n March 16—also violently broken up by government forces—he left the City Hall area about 5 p.m. to escort a group of teenagers home to Hlaing Township.

Both Toe Kyi and Ko Naing, then 24, were in the crowd o­n Prome Road the following month, o­n September 19, when again the military fired o­n protesters. Those demonstrations were followed by the coup that brought the present regime to power.

OBL:72137;Sharing the Wealth: A Roadmap for Distributing Myanmar’s Natural Resource Revenues;;"Myanmar's Union government collects much of the trillions of kyat generated by oil, gas, gemstones and other minerals each year, primarily through its state-owned economic enterprises (SEEs).

In the face of such centralized control over revenue, many ethnic groups have long asserted their right to make decisions over resource management in their states. Combatants in areas of active conflict and leaders from several ethnic minority parties—particularly those associated with Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states—have openly called for greater resource revenue sharing. (See map below for more on Myanmar’s extractive geography.)

In response, the newly elected National League for Democracy (NLD) has committed to ""work to ensure a fair distribution across the country of the profits from natural resource extraction, in accordance with the principles of a federal union."" As such, a resource revenue sharing system will undoubtedly be on the table in the upcoming discussion on federalism.

However, as we have seen in other countries, these systems come with considerable risks. In the most extreme cases, such as Peru, they can actually exacerbate conflict, encouraging local leaders to use violence to compel greater transfers from the central government or gain control over mine sites. While these experiences are atypical, natural resource revenue sharing often leads to financial waste, local inflation, boom-bust cycles and poor public investment decisions.

However, if well designed, resource revenue sharing can: improve development outcomes and the quality of public investment; attract high quality private investors to the sector; and help secure a lasting peace. Sharing the Wealth: A Roadmap for Distributing Myanmar's Natural Resource Revenues outlines options available under the current legal structure to help the new leadership fulfill its commitment to decentralize natural resource revenues. It is also meant to inform Myanmar's broader discourse on how best to distribute these revenues.

First, it outlines the current state of fiscal decentralization in Myanmar. Second, it describes the size and location of extractive activities given the limited information currently available. Third, it aims to share good practices for revenue distribution and international experiences. Fourth, it outlines policy options and considerations for policymakers on intergovernmental transfers and addresses the debate on tax assignments...";"Andrew Bauer

OBL:72715;The Political Economy of Land Governance in the Mekong Region;;"This report presents a political-economic analysis of 
land governance at the regional level, focusing on the
Mekong Region

 The primary emphasis is on Cambodia, 
Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV), but the paper also 
takes into account the regional role and land governance 
experiences of Thailand and China. The report is one in
a series of reports on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and 
Vietnam that present country-level analyses of the poli-
tical economy of land governance. The series is part of 
a research mapping and political-economic analysis 
conducted by the authors for the Mekong Region Land
Governance (MRLG) project, funded by the Swiss Agency
for Development Cooperation (SDC) and the German 
Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ). The initiative 
is driven by concerns about security of tenure of small-
holder farmers, ethnic minorities and women, against a 
background of land grabbing in various guises (see 
www.mrlg.org)...

In this case, the Mekong is broadly coterminous with mainland Southeast Asia. While it takes the river as its defining motif, the region is much wider than the Mekong River 
and its tributaries. Alternatively framed, the Greater Mekong Sub-region is comprised of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the two provinces of China that 
border Southeast Asia (Yunnan and Guangxi). The project-specific definition of the region behind this report includes the CLMV countries. Sometimes referred to as the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) latecomers, the once-socialist economies seek to integrate and capitalise their economies. In the context of land-based 
investment with which the report is concerned, Thailand and China enter as important players – providing a more complete picture of the region.

Political Economy of Land Governance in the Mekong Region
A Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) report defines “land governance” succinctly as 
follows:
“Land governance concerns the rules, processes and 
structures through which decisions are made about 
access to land and its use, the manner in which the 
decisions are implemented and enforced, the way that 
competing interests in land are managed” (Palmer et 
al. 2009: 9).”
Our working definition expands on the FAO definition as 
follows: 
“Land governance consists of the means by which 
authority is wielded and collective action applied in 
order to achieve particular social and economic out-
comes through land use, distribution, access and
security. Land governance is concerned with processes,
institutions, laws, practices and structures of power 
involving a diverse range of public and private actors.”
Land governance is a scaled issue, involving broad level 
influences at the global, regional, national and local
scales. This paper seeks to explain the main parameters 
of land governance at the regional scale, with a particular
focus on the Mekong Region. Our project of conducting 
a regional political-economic analysis considers the
questions: Why apply political economy to an analysis
of land governance, and what does a regional scale 
analysis entail? In other words, what makes land govern-
ance a political-economic issue, and what makes it a
regional issue?
LAND GOVERNANCE: A POLITICAL-
ECONOMIC ISSUE
Not all approaches to land governance place it in the 
realm of political economy per se. Land governance 
can be approached from a number of angles. In a uni-
versal and normative sense “good land governance” 
is sought through a range of global level assessment 
criteria (see, for example, The Land Governance 
Assessment Framework: Identifying and Monitoring 
Good Practice in the Land Sector, Deininger et al. 
2011). The FAO has established a set of non-binding 
guidelines for “responsible” governance of land tenure 
and other natural resources (FAO 2012). A number of 
development assistance initiatives funded by Australian, 
German, Finnish, Canadian, Swiss (and other) bilateral
development agencies have sought to improve land 
governance in the Mekong Region by programmatic 
means (see www.landgov.donorplatform.org). Each of these 
frameworks has its own emphasis; some are 
more market-oriented and some are geared to a liberal
rights-oriented approach of social inclusion. However, 
all work within broad “good governance” criteria of 
transparency, rule of law, stakeholder inclusion and 
equitable market structures. While there is recognition 
of the need to adapt global concepts and criteria of 
‘good
 governance’ to country
 circumstances, the political-
economic embeddedness of land issues has often been 
overlooked. 
Only recently have some donors specifically sought to 
conduct political-economic analysis in recognition of 
program risks and failures attributed to insufficient
account being taken of the context within which programs
operate. For example, responding to the World Bank 
Inspection Panel that investigated the Land Management 
and Administration Project in Cambodia, Management of
LMAP noted: 
“With the benefit of hindsight, Management recognises 
that ... a more detailed analysis of the political economy 
context would likely have identified ... that... numerous 
actors had strong incentives not to proceed with a trans-
parent and public interest based classification and 
registration of State land” (IBRD & IDA, 21 January, 
2011, p. 15...";"Philip Hirsch

OBL:72716;The neoliberal agricultural modernization model: A fundamental cause for large?scale land acquisition and counter land reform policies in the Mekong region;;"Abstract: ""Large-scale land acquisition are not new in the Mekong region but have been encouraged and have
gathered momentum since the end of the 90s, particularly Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. These
acquisitions are realized by national and foreign companies from the region, particularly China,
Vietnam, and Thailand in a movement strongly associated with economic globalization and neo-liberal
policies which promote free flow of capital at the regional and global level and the adaptation of
national spaces to the requirement of liberal and global markets (Peemans, 2013). It is striking to see
how Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, with different political regimes and histories, have shifted
radically from a model based on land ownership by the State’ with a relatively egalitarian land access
by family farmers, to a model encouraging long term land leases that favor the emergence of large
capitalist private and corporate owners and the abandon of land national sovereignty principles, sensu
Borras and Franco (2012). In fact, the present policies favoring large scale concessions (largely at the
expense of small holders and of indigenous peoples / ethnic minorities) can be considered as a
“counter agrarian reform”, the opposite of land reform policies promoted by both socialist countries
and by the USA (Alliance for Peace) in the 60s, although with very different modalities and objectives.
Although different factors can explain these policy shifts, in particular widespread corruption and
patrimonial practices of the political elites, on the one hand and geo-strategy and political influence of
regional powers on the other hand, this paper argues that this model of agricultural modernization
through FDI and large scale land acquisition is being promoted through the convergence of actors such
as the international agro-industrial complex, International Financial institutions (IFI), some bi-lateral
donor or government state owned funds/enterprises. The claims of this model, largely shared by the
region’s middle class and intellectuals, can be outlined as follows: 1) an inflow of FDI – Foreign
Direct Investment - is essential for economic development; 2) large-scale agriculture is more efficient
than family farming in terms of economic development; 3) privatizing land facilitates investments and
therefore increases land and labor productivity; 4) subsistence peasant and ethnic minority farmers are
structurally incapable of agricultural development progress and would be better off if they become
wage workers; and 5) the growing ‘modern economy’ will naturally absorb the work force coming out
of agriculture and that of general population growth. All these assertions can be challenged to various
degrees, both form a theoretical and empirical point of view. Available evidence indicates that
economic benefits have not accrued at the level expected – either to family farmers or to the state
treasuries – as cash benefits have been ‘privatized’ by domestic power elites hidden behind nontransparent
one-party states, but also because many investments have produced disappointing results.
The increase in number of landless farmers and rising number of land conflicts poses a serious
challenge to the legitimacy and stability of the concerned states. However, although numerous case
studies can be found, the aggregated information available on the impacts of large-scale agricultural
investments is scarce. This paper will conclude by proposing as a strategy aiming to challenge the
dominant ‘paradigm’ of agricultural modernization based on large scale agriculture and FDI, by
research-based initiatives and policy dialogue at the regional level, as a way to improve land policies
in favor of family farmers and ethnic minorities."".....";"Christian Castellanet

OBL:72717;The Political Economy of Land Governance in Myanmar;;"Land governance is an inherently political-economic
issue. This report on Myanmar1 is one of a series of
country reports on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Viet
Nam (CLMV) that seek to present country-level analyses
of the political economy of land governance.
The country level analysis addresses land governance
in Myanmar in two ways. First, it summarises what the
existing body of knowledge tells us about power and
configurations that shape access to and exclusion from
land, particularly among smallholders, the rural poor,
ethnic minorities and women. Second, it draws upon
existing literature and expert assessment to provide a
preliminary analysis of the openings for and obstacles
to land governance reform afforded by the political
economic structures and dynamics of each country.
The premise of this analysis is that existing configurations
of social, political, administrative and economic
power lead to unequal distribution of land and related
resources. They also produce outcomes that are socially
exclusionary, environmentally unsustainable and economically
inefficient. Power imbalances at various levels of
society result in growing insecurity of land tenure, loss
of access to resources by smallholders, increasing food
and livelihood insecurity, and human rights abuses. The
first part of this analysis explains why, how and with
what results for different groups these exclusionary
arrangements and outcomes are occurring.
In recognition of the problems associated with existing
land governance arrangements, a number of reform
initiatives are underway in the Mekong Region. Most of
these initiatives seek to enhance security of access to
land by disadvantaged groups. All the initiatives work
within existing structures of power, and the second part
of the analysis discusses the potential opportunities and
constraints afforded by the existing arrangements.
This country report commences with a brief identification
of the political-economic context that sets
the parameters for existing land governance and for
reform in Myanmar. It then explores the politicaleconomic
dynamics of land relations and identifies key
transitions in land relations that affect access to land
and tenure security for smallholders. Finally, the report
discusses key openings for, and constraints to, land
governance reform.
Myanmar is marked by a rapid opening of its economy to
foreign investment. This has exacerbated insecurity over
land in a country where arbitrary use of authority has
troubled smallholders for decades. Close association
between the military (which still controls the levers of
government), domestic big business and foreign corporate
interests produces a powerful force for land
alienation in a country where the current accelerated
development path is largely based on land-demanding
projects. These projects include agribusiness plantations,
extractives projects in the energy and mining sector, and
special economic zones (SEZs). The space for open
dialogue and challenges around these issues has opened
up rapidly, leaving civil society, government officials and
the international community scrambling to stay abreast.
Meanwhile, new and complex issues have emerged on top
of old problems as neoliberal approaches to turn land
into capital see tenure reforms move in the direction of
private land titling for smallholder sedentary lowland
farmers. In addition, new land and investment-related
laws enable foreign capital into land-based deals,
particularly for agribusiness.";"Natalia Scurrah

OBL:100132;An Introductory Guide to Understanding and Claiming Housing, Land and Property Restitution Rights in Myanmar: Questions and Answers”.;;"... The restitution of housing, land and property rights after conflicts
and periods of non-democratic governance are fundamental aspects of transitional justice which are
essential for the achievement of durable solutions to forced displacement, and to broader concerns
of peace, reconciliation and economic prosperity. The NRC Country Office in Myanmar considers it
necessary and positive to increase attention to raise public awareness on international standards on
the matter as well as national laws and available legal remedies. For these reasons, in partnership with
Displacement Solutions, the NRC has supported the publication by international restitution expert Scott
Leckie of this “An Introductory Guide to Understanding and Claiming Housing, Land and Property
Restitution Rights in Myanmar: Questions and Answers”.
The guide gives an overview on how restitution has been addressed thus far in Myanmar, the position
of international law on the question of restitution and some of the key existing obstacles and gaps. This
guide is designed for use by refugees and IDPs and their representatives, providing a simple, easy-tounderstand
written tool on the basic principles of restitution, where these measures have taken place
in other countries and various mechanisms that have been established to enable claims processes for
HLP losses. Clearly, at present there are essentially no effective HLP remedies available for refugees

OBL:72394;Videos of founders of the field of conflict analysis and peace research (videos);;"In 2003 we started to undertake a project we had long talked about and planned, namely to record visually the recollections and views of some of the individual scholars and practitioners who initiated the field of conflict analysis and peace research in the 1950s and 1960s....

Many of these “parents of the field” were now in their 70s and 80s, but most were still working and researching. Some were continuing to teach the next generation of students in the field, while others were still pursuing the ideal - first enunciated by one of the pioneers from the 1940s, Kurt Lewin - of becoming “practical theorists,” that is, scholars who actually used some of their skills and knowledge to help resolve conflicts in the real world.

The original idea was limited in scope, namely to video-tape interviews with 15 'key' figures in the development of “conflict and peace research.” The issue of what to call the field [or the discipline] became one of the questions on which we sought enlightenment, as it rapidly became clear that the early days had seen much discussion about what the new field of study should be called, what its main focus should be, and how it might best have an impact on the world of problems and policy..."".....Interviews with

OBL:72625;AQUACULTURE IN TRANSITION: VALUE CHAIN TRANSFORMATION, FISH AND FOOD SECURITY IN MYANMAR;;"Fish farming (aquaculture) is important to Myanmar’s food security and is developing and
transforming quickly. This study presents findings from a new field survey of the farmed
fish value chain that is more detailed and broader than any previous study conducted in
Myanmar. Many of our findings are at odds with what we perceive as conventional wisdom
about fish farming in Myanmar. The findings have important policy implications to unlock
the sector’s full growth potential and food security contributions....Fish is important for domestic food security – it is the leading purveyor of animal protein
and the lead provider of micronutrients, important especially for child development, to
Myanmar consumers. Fish is important in the food budget of households: nearly as much is
spent on fish (14% of food expenditure) as on rice (19% of food expenditure). Fish farming
also generates a lot of employment – about twice as much per acre as paddy farming. Fishfarming
accounts for about 20% of domestic fish consumption in Myanmar. This is a long
way behind neighboring Thailand and Bangladesh (about 80% and 55%, respectively);
farmed fish already accounted for about 20% of the fish consumed in both these countries
by the late 1980’s....Even though it is a common perception that aquaculture output is mainly exported, in fact,
roughly 20% is exported, and 80% goes to the domestic market. We anticipate that the
export share will even decline further in the near to medium term as the Myanmar urban
market grows....";"Ben Belton1

OBL:100140;Transparency Under Scrutiny: Information Disclosure by the Parliamentary Land Investigation Commission in Myanmar;;"This case study presents a country-wide quantitative analysis of a Parliamentary Commission established in 2012 in Myanmar to examine ‘land grab’ cases considered and to propose solutions towards releasing the land to its original owners, in most cases smallholder farming families. The study analyses the information contained in four reports released to the public, but also aims to elicit information they do not reveal.

First of all, the paper suggests the commission has failed to provide detailed information about land grabs by the military. Second, the Commission seems to have targeted urban areas and urbanization projects and has underestimated land grab cases in rural areas. Third, by contrasting the locations of land confiscation cases with those of agro-industrial concessions as of 2011, the paper also shows how the Commission has evaded, rather than tackled, some very critical land confiscation issues driven by these concessions.

Kachin State is an ethnic region in northern Burma that has long been in conflict with the central Burmese government.1 In 2011, a seventeen-year cease-fire was broken, resulting in the resumption of active warfare between the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO)—the political arm of the Kachin people—and the Burmese military, at the government’s behest. In spite of ongoing attempts at peace negotiations, the Kachin Women’s Association of Thailand has documented an alarming number of atrocities—including rape, arbitrary arrest and torture—against civilians (Kachin Women’s Association of Thailand, 2013). The area has been documented to be an active conflict zone resulting in one of the worst humanitarian crisis’ in the Mekong Sub-Region (Human Rights Watch, 2014). According to a report by the prior Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma, over 120,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have fled to border areas of Burma and China to escape the fighting (Quintana, 2014), and these communities suffer from a lack of basic necessities and little to no foreign aid. These desperate conditions have left civilians—women, in particular—very vulnerable. As a result, trafficking in women – often to Yunnan Province as forced brides – is on the rise. This form of trafficking, however, has not been made a priority on the policy agendas of the Burmese or Chinese governments, and there is currently no official anti-trafficking policy operating within Kachin State...";Erin M.

OBL:74586;OPEN FOR BUSINESS? CORPORATE CRIME AND ABUSES AT MYANMAR COPPER MINE;;"Executive Summary: ""This report is the culmination of a one year investigation by Amnesty International into alleged human
rights abuses by companies, including multinational companies, operating in Myanmar. The
report focuses on the Monywa copper mine project and highlights forced evictions, substantial
environmental and social impacts, and the repression, sometimes brutal, of those who try to protest.
It also raises serious questions about opaque corporate dealings and possible infringements of economic
sanctions on Myanmar. The report calls on the Government of Myanmar to urgently introduce
strong measures for the protection of human rights, and on multinational companies and the home
governments of those companies to ensure that due diligence is carried out to international standards
for all investment in Myanmar...This report examines the issues in relation to one major mining operation - the Monywa project -
made up of the Sabetaung and Kyisintaung (S&K) and the Letpadaung copper mines. During an
extensive one-year investigation, Amnesty International examined incidents that are specific to the
Monywa project as well as some of the wider structural issues – such as the processes for acquisition
of land and environmental protection – that will affect other extractive projects in Myanmar. The
organization found that, since its inception and throughout its various changes in ownership, the
Monywa project has been characterised by serious human rights abuses and a lack of transparency.
Thousands of people have been forcibly evicted by the government with the knowledge, and in some
cases the participation, of foreign companies. Environmental impacts have been poorly assessed
and managed, with grave long-term implications for the health and livelihoods of people living near
the mine. Protests by communities have been met with excessive force by police..."".....CONCLUSION:
The Government of Myanmar is responsible for the serious human rights violations that have taken
place at the Monywa project over many years. It has forcibly evicted people and has failed to put in
place safeguards to protect mine-affected communities from environmental pollution which can im-
pact their rights to water and health, amongst other rights. It has shown an unwillingness to monitor
corporate activity or to hold companies accountable for the harm their operations cause.
The companies involved also bear responsibility. Despite a history of human rights violations sur-
rounding the mine, a Canadian company, and subsequently a Chinese company, have invested
without undertaking appropriate due diligence to ensure that past abuses were remediated and
future abuses prevented. They have profited from abuses that they knew or should have known were
happening, and have, in certain cases, themselves abused rights by participating in forced evictions
or failing to remediate environmental pollution.
The system that enabled the transfer of the Monywa project to a business venture that involved My-
anmar military interests, without any transparency as to how such a sale occurred, is emblematic of
the lack of accountability that exists around allocations of concessions and contracts in the extractive
industry in Myanmar.
The people of Myanmar must not see a resource curse unfold as it has done in so many other
countries where powerful economic interests profit from a context in which regulation is weak,
the government is unwilling to hold powerful political interests accountable and there is little or no
transparency. The home states of multinational corporations must ensure that these corporations
do not unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of Myanmar’s poorest people. The home states of
companies involved in the Monywa project – Canada and China – have failed to do this..."".....The report also contains critical analyses of Myanmar's land legislation.";;;Amnesty International;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;10-02-2015;en;"mining;extractive industries;expropriation;natural resources management;land use;land grabbing";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74586;http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA16/003/2015/en/12a4143a-ee84-4ce1-8d32-a72a916e29f7/asa160032015en.pdf;;;;

OBL:64851;Financing Dispossession - China’s Opium Substitution Programme in Northern Burma;;"Northern Burma’s borderlands have undergone dramatic changes in the last two decades. Three main and
interconnected developments are simultaneously taking place in Shan State and Kachin State: (1) the increase
in opium cultivation in Burma since 2006 after a decade of steady decline; (2) the increase at about the same
time in Chinese agricultural investments in northern Burma under China’s opium substitution programme,
especially in rubber; and (3) the related increase in dispossession of local communities’ land and livelihoods
in Burma’s northern borderlands.
The vast majority of the opium and heroin on the Chinese market originates from northern Burma. Apart
from attempting to address domestic consumption problems, the Chinese government also has created a
poppy substitution development programme, and has been actively promoting Chinese companies to take
part, offering subsidies, tax waivers, and import quotas for Chinese companies. The main benefits of these
programmes do not go to (ex-)poppy growing communities, but to Chinese businessmen and local authorities,
and have further marginalised these communities.
Serious concerns arise regarding the long-term economic benefits and costs of agricultural development—
mostly rubber—for poor upland villagers. Economic benefits derived from rubber development are very
limited. Without access to capital and land to invest in rubber concessions, upland farmers practicing swidden
cultivation (many of whom are (ex-) poppy growers) are left with few alternatives but to try to get work as
wage labourers on the agricultural concessions.
Land tenure and other related resource management issues are vital ingredients for local communities to
build licit and sustainable livelihoods. Investment-induced land dispossession has wide implications for drug
production and trade, as well as border stability. Investments related to opium substitution should be carried
out in a more sustainable, transparent, accountable and equitable fashion. Customary land rights and institutions
should be respected. Chinese investors should use a smallholder plantation model instead of confiscating
farmers land as a concession. Labourers from the local population should be hired rather than outside
migrants in order to funnel economic benefits into nearby communities.
China’s opium crop substitution programme has very little to do with providing mechanisms to decrease
reliance on poppy cultivation or provide alternative livelihoods for ex-poppy growers. Chinese authorities
need to reconsider their regional development strategies of implementation in order to avoid further border
conflict and growing antagonism from Burmese society.

Every year thousands of people flee across the border, primarily into Thailand, to escape these human rights violations which include mass forced relocation, arbitrary arrest, torture, rape, and extra-judicial killing. Some of these people are able to seek asylum in refugee camps in Thailand and Bangladesh, however many of those fleeing human rights violations are not recognized as refugees by the Thai and Bangladeshi Governments.

OBL:64109;Community Forestry in Myanmar: Progress & Potentials;;"SUMMARY:
""This paper is the main output of a research project initiated by Pyoe Pin, and led by ECCDI with support from the University of East Anglia, whose aim has been to fill the gap in knowledge over the progress of Community Forestry in Myanmar through a systematic study. This paper presents the key data and findings, and offers policy recommendations based on these.
Of Myanmar?s 67.6 m ha land area, forests currently cover around 48%, although there has been a declining trend for the last century (they covered over 65% early in the 20th Century). The declining trend is particularly dramatic for dense forests, which have more than halved in the last twenty years, from covering 45.6% of land in 1990, the single largest land use, to now just 19.9%.
The long -term decline in forests, is due to a combination of factors; change of land use (especially land hunger from the growing population), commercial timber harvesting (and the indirect effect of increasing accessibility through road construction), and also intensifying pressure on remaining forests for livelihood needs especially fuelwood.
Forest reservation was initiated by the British from 1856, creating a national forest estate but taking over control of many villages? forests in the process. Community Forestry has been a successful policy around the world for communities to protect and sustainably manage their forests and derive livelihood benefits. It was encompassed in Myanmar?s colonial era policies to some extent through the creation of Local Supply Working Circles. However, these were under Forest Department management and have not been a success, with most becoming encroached or degraded.
Returning control of the management rights and responsibilities for village forests to the villages became seen by policy makers as critically important in the 1990s both to mobilise communities to protect and regenerate adjacent forests, and also to ensure that they fulfil their forest product needs locally. Hence, the Community Forestry Instruction (CFI) was issued in 1995, and initiated the promotion of Community Forestry in Myanmar.
Implementation of the Community Forestry Instruction began immediately, and was promoted by international donor projects (e.g. UNDP / JICA / DFID) as well as through Forest Department promotion, and in some cases self-organization by communities. Implementation received a major boost through the Forestry Master Plan (2001) which mandated that 2.27 mil. acres (1.36% of the country) be handed over to FUGs by 2030-31.
Annual progress of Community Forest establishment since 1995 had averaged 6,943 acres (2,810 ha), and there are now 572 Forest Users? Groups with certificates, managing 104,146 acres of forest, (with more awaiting their certificate). Implementation progress has been highest in Shan, Rakhine, Magway and Mandalay, most of which have been under UNDP project support.
However, the rate of CF handover has been far lower than that needed to meet the Master Plan?s 30-year target (i.e. 2.27 million acres by 2030). For this we would need to hand over 50,000 acres (approx. 20,000 ha) per year, a rate almost ten times higher. (The FD also aims to obtain 4.13 million m3 of wood fuel from community forests, amounting to 25% of the country?s total wood fuel requirement of 16.53 million m3 by 2030, another target unlikely to be achieved at the current rate).
After 15 years of Community Forestry in Myanmar, there are a wide range of experiences which have significant implications for sustainable forest management and community and livelihood development. To understand how community forestry is working we developed a detailed inter-disciplinary research design with a range of stakeholders in late 2010. Having finalised our method we then selected two States
and two Regions (Kachin, Mandalay, Shan, Ayeyawady) for study, and objectively selected 16 FUGs within these, using a statistically sound sampling method to reflect the diverse environments where CF is happening. We then conducted field work in 16 Community Forests and associated villages. This started in the second week of October and was completed by the end of December 2010. The community forests were assessed, the local Forest Users? Group institution researched, and a total of 272 households interviewed...";"Kyaw Tint

Land grabbing as big business in Myanmar
By Brian McCartan

Inadequate land laws have opened rural Myanmar to rampant land grabbing by unscrupulous, well-connected businessmen who anticipate a boom in agricultural and property investment. If unchecked, the gathering trend has the potential to undermine the country's broad reform process and impede long-term economic progress.

Under the former military regime, land grabbing became a common and largely uncontested practice. Government bodies, particularly military units, were able to seize large tracts of farmland, usually without compensation. While some of the land



was used for the expansion of military bases, new government offices or infrastructure projects, much of it was used either by military units for their own commercial purposes or sold to private companies.

The threat of military force meant there was little grass roots opposition to these land seizures and few avenues to secure adequate compensation. That's changed under the new democratic order as local communities band together to fight back against seizure of their lands. Many of the current land disputes date to the period before the 2010 general elections that ushered in President Thein Sein's reformist quasi-civilian government...Two new land laws passed on March 30, 2012 - the Farmland Law and the Vacant, Fallow, and Virgin Land Management Law - were intended to clarify ownership under the constitution and provide protections to land owners. While the laws guaranteed more individual ownership rights, to date big businesses have profited most from the legislation.

The new laws created a dysfunctional and opaque system of land registration and administration that reinforced a top-down decision-making process without local participation. The absence of adequate legal and judicial recourse for the protection of land rights has further exacerbated the situation. Rather than deter land rights violations, the laws have effectively facilitated more land grabbing and manipulation of the system...";Brian McCartan;;Asia Times;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;08-03-2013;en;"land policies;property rights;expropriation;land use planning;land governance;land grabbing;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61578;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-080313.html;;;;

OBL:64615;Humanitarian Situation and Response Plan in Kachin - March 2012 update;;"...Between June 2011 and February 2012, instability
across Kachin and northern Shan states resulted in
displacement, damage of infrastructure and loss of
lives and livelihoods. Despite ongoing peace negotiation
between parties to the conflict, incidents
continue to be reported. Additionally, there are
indications that a number of people fled just across
the Myanmar-China border and live with relatives
or in temporary makeshift camps, but information is
still unclear and cannot be independently verified.
The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)
steadily increased from September 2011 (approx
20,000 people) to an estimated 50-55,000 people at
present. These people sought refuge in camps, in
public buildings, in host families or in the jungle.
The numbers of IDPs continue to fluctuate and in
some locations, some IDPs temporarily return to
their villages to attempt salvaging some of their livelihood,
leaving some of their family members in
camps or with relatives. Available information indicates
that these returns are not permanent or substantial
in numbers, as IDPs continue to be concerned
over ongoing tensions and instability as well
as presence of landmines.
Whilst the Kachin State Government started a planning
exercise encompassing return and recovery
operations, the Union Government and the Kachin
State Government have clearly stated that only
those who wish to return should do so, and that
assistance in camps must continue. The State Government
indicated relief aid and recovery operations
will require support from the aid community
well into 2013.

assistance to some 19,000 Internally Displaced Persons
(IDPs) located in fully accessible towns of Myitkyina, Waingmaw, Bhamo, Mansi, Momauk, Putao and Shwegu, some (mostly local) partners do
have some degree of access to population in other

OBL:75185;A Nutrition and Food Security A ssessment of the Dry Zone of Myanmar in June and July 2013;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ""This assessment of the rural Dry Zone reveals the
nutrition situation to be a concern, with high
rates of wasting and medium rates of stunting, high rates of low birth weight and high rates
of undernutrition among mothers; particularly
those who are pregnant and/or lactating. The
pattern of indicators suggests that flood plains and irrigated areas are best off,
and the
highlands may be worst,
but the situation is far from acceptable in the Dry Zone as a whole.
A wide range of likely causes of undernutrition needs addressing. Acute and chronic
malnutrition have shared determinants and there is a need to tackle one to tackle the other.
Children’s and mother’s nutrition status are associated, and a child’s birth weight is an
important determinant of their later nutrition status. This
reminds
us of the imortance of
the 1000 day window
of opportunity between a child’s conception and their second birthday,
and the need to take a life-cycle approach; paying p
articular attention to pregnant and
breastfeeding mothers. Dietary factors and their determinants seem
likely
to be particularly
important drivers of undernutrition as do
deficiencies in water, sanitation, hygiene and the
public health environment.
An absence of consistent associations between household
economic status and nutrition indicators is likely
in part because of widespread poverty
as well
as the focus on data from the current situation.
However, analysis of associations revealed
only small contributions of any specific explanatory variable to the variance of any of the
nutrition outcomes
(including indicators of food security)
which together with analysis of risk
factors reinforces that there is not just two or three important causes of undernutrition
in the
Dry Zone.
Rather,a multi-sector approach is required for malnutrition prevention and
nutrition status improvement.";;;"Save the Children;World Food Programme;the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-06-2013;en;food security;Land & Food Security;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75185;http://lift-fund.org/Dry%20Zone%20Consultation%20/Background_Studies_Reading/FINAL%20Nutrition%20and%20Food%20Security%20Survey%20of%20the%20Dry%20Zone%20of%20Myanmar-%20June%20July%202013-%20100214_0.pdf;;;;

Introduction:
""In 1929 the Burma Game Manual stated its guiding principle: ""A countryside devoid of wildlife is uninteresting and unnatural, and life under such conditions can adversely affect the national character."" Therefore, invaluable natural and national assets had to be saved from destruction. This has not happened in large portions of Myanmar, especially the fertile lands of the Irrawaddy freshwater swamp forest. Most of the ecoregion's original forests, and subsequent wildlife such as Asian elephants and tigers, have been destroyed. Protection of the last remaining bits of habitat and restoration ecology will be key elements of returning this ecoregion to its natural state.

Description

 Location and General Description
The Irrawaddy River flows into the Bay of Bengal, and its delta is made up of mangroves and freshwater swamp forests of this ecoregion. This ecoregion is an extremely fertile area because of the riverborne silt deposited in the delta. The southern portion of the ecoregion transitions into the Myanmar Coastal Mangroves [IM1404] and is made up of fanlike marshes with oxbow lakes, islands, and meandering rivulets and streams.

Topographically the region is primarily flatlands. The western part of the region is bounded by the Rakhine (Arakan) Yomas, with the highest elevation at about 1,287 m to the north, tapering down to the south to 428 m....";;;World Wildlife Fund;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;;en;"environment;land environment;land cover;sustainable land management";Land, Climate change & Environment;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/47441;http://www.worldwildlife.org/science/wildfinder/profiles/im0116.html;;;;
OBL:56074;Robbing the Future - Russian-backed Mining Project Threatens Pa-O Communities in Shan State, Burma;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
""The transformation of Mount Pinpet, or ""Pine Tree Mountain,"" in Burma's war-torn Shan State, for the excavation and refinement of the country's second largest iron ore deposit is changing the very nature of life there, and if not stopped could permanently destroy the home of more than 7,000 primarily ethnic Pa-O residents.
Since 2004 Russian and Burmese companies have been preparing to develop the deposit and are currently building an iron processing plant and a cement factory on a total of 11,000 acres of lands. An Italian company is also believed to be involved in the project.
Although there has been a ceasefire in the area since 1991, the military ruling Burma has established three sizeable battalion camps and two military universities in or around the nearby towns of Taunggyi and Hopone. Fighting has flared up south of the project site and has led to recent torture and killing of villagers by the Burma Army.
Twenty-five villages, a total of 7,000 people, could be permanently displaced from their homes and farmlands by the projects. A further 35,000 people rely on the watershed of the Thabet Stream in the valley east of the mountain.
Fifty people have already been forced to move and were not adequately compensated. The confiscation of vital farmlands has begun, leaving over 100 families without the primary source of their livelihood and sustenance. Travel restrictions have closed down a major road and prohibited villagers from collecting firewood, food, and shelter materials on the mountain.
The entire mountain of Pinpet will be excavated for this project, irrevocably changing the landscape and environment of the area. Pollution from mine tailings and erosion of mine heaps threaten the main water source of Hopone Valley. Ancient pagodas have been cracked and may be demolished altogether by explosions to prepare construction sites and begin excavation.
Local communities have not been informed or consulted about project plans and complaints to authorities about the confiscation of lands and lack of compensation have not been addressed. No assessments of the projects have been made public and mining authorities are pushing ahead by using the force of armed local military to relocate families, confiscate lands, restrict movements, and intimidate communities.
The lack of information is compounded by persistent speculation that the mining operation is in fact being set up to exploit and refine uranium, not only iron ore and limestone. These fears are fueled by Burma's announcement in 2007 that Russia is to build a nuclear reactor in the country.
The companies responsible for these projects should stop all activity and first conduct thorough and transparent assessments of the projects' environmental and social impacts; adequate compensation should be provided for those who have already lost their homes and lands; to assuage fears, all nuclear and uranium mining plans should be made public; and, such projects should not be conducted under the force of military power.
The Pa-O Youth Organization stands with its community to protect livelihoods, land ownership, and cultural heritage, and calls on regional and international actors to inspect the Pinpet projects and use their influence to ensure respect for the rights of affected communities.";;;Pa-O Youth Organization (PYO);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-05-2009;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/56074;http://burmalibrary.org/docs07/Robbing_the_Future%28en%29.pdf;;;;

Following a Government invi-tation, an inter-agency rapid needs assessment was conducted from 20-26 September in 39 locations in some IDPs sites (camps, host families, public build-ings) of five townships (Bhamo, Momauk, Myitky-ina, Khaunglanhpu and Waingmaw) targeting 5,925 IDPs.

OBL:42813;A Choice for China: Ending the destruction of Burma's frontier forests;;"(Press release): ""... Ending the destruction of Burma’s northern frontier forests"" , details shocking new evidence of the massive illicit plunder of Burma’s forests by Chinese logging companies. Much of the logging takes place in forests that form part of an area said to be “very possibly the most bio-diverse, rich, temperate area on earth.”

In 2004, more than 1 million cubic meters of timber, about 95% of Burma’s total timber exports to China were illegally exported from northern Burma to Yunnan Province. This trade, amounting to a $250 million loss for the Burmese people, every year, takes place with the full knowledge of the Burmese regime, the government in Beijing and the rest of the international community. Chinese companies, local Chinese authorities, regional Tatmadaw and ethnic ceasefire groups are all directly involved.

“On average, one log truck, carrying about 15 tonnes of timber, logged illegally in Burma, crosses an official Chinese checkpoint every seven minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; yet they do nothing.” Said Jon Buckrell of Global Witness.

In September 2001 the government of the People’s Republic of China made a commitment to strengthen bilateral collaboration to address violations of forest law and forest crime, including illegal logging and associated illegal trade. However, since then, illegal imports of timber across the Burma-China border have actually increased by 60%.

“A few Chinese businessmen, backed by the authorities in Yunnan Province, are completely undermining Chinese government initiatives to combat illegal logging. Not only are the activities of these loggers jeopardising the prospect of sustainable development in northern Burma they are also breaking Chinese law.” Said Buckrell.""...

In September 2004 EU member states called for the European Commission to produce “…specific proposals to address the issue of Burmese illegal logging…” Later, in October, the European Council expressed support for the development of programmes to address, “the problem of non-sustainable, excessive logging” that resulted in deforestation in Burma. To date, the EU has done next to nothing.

“Like China, the EU has so far failed the Burmese people. How many more livelihoods will be destroyed before the Commission and EU member states get their act together?” Asked Buckrell.

It is essential that the Chinese government stops timber imports across the Burma-China border, with immediate effect, and until such time sufficient safeguards are in place that can guarantee legality of the timber supply. The Chinese authorities should also take action against companies and officials involved in the illegal trade.

Global Witness is calling for the establishment of a working group to facilitate measures to combat illegal logging, to ensure equitable, transparent and sustainable forest management, and to promote long-term development in northern Burma.

OBL:45796;Woodfuel Production and Marketing in Myanmar - National Workshop RWEDP Report No.56, 2001;;"Despite the all-out efforts currently being made by the Myanmar Government to conserve and improve its forest resources, forest degradation and depletion are continuing at an alarming rate, mainly due to shifting cultivation, agricultural encroachment and illicit cutting. The heavy reliance on woodfuel has eroded its supply source in numerous areas and it is clear that unless urgent remedial measures are undertaken the more accessible forests will soon be exhausted and remote areas will have to be exploited instead, involving rising market prices.

The National Training Workshop on the Integration of Wood Fuel Production and Marketing in Forest, Agriculture and Tree Production Systems in Myanmar, jointly organised by the Forest And Energy Departments of Myanmar in March 1999, was a milestone in the country's efforts to achieve sustainable bioenergy development. The workshop enhanced the awareness of wood energy amongst foresters and agroforestry practitioners, energy experts and many others directly related to training and research in relevant sectors and led to the recommendation of pragmatic strategies to promote sustainable bioenergy development for future implementation, such as the integration of multipurpose fast-growing trees into the farming system and the incorporation of wood energy into the policies of directly relevant sectors (i.e. energy, forestry, agriculture and rural development).""

Home guards are villagers who provide security for communities of civilians in hiding. Widespread displacement occurred in Lu Thaw Township during Tatmadaw offensives in 1997 and between 2005 and 2008. Since then, many of those displaced have lived in make-shift, temporary housing in the jungle and mountainous areas with inadequate health and education facilities and without access to land on which to grow food for daily consumption. Villagers living in these areas have demanded that local Tatmadaw bases be closed so they can return to their homes, and have highlighted a range of risks associated with living in internal displacement sites, including exposure to landmines.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;23-06-2014;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75270;http://burmalibrary.org/KHRG/KHRG%202014/KHRG-2014-06-23-Home_guard_killed_by_Tatmadaw_landmine_in_Lu_Thaw_Township_January_2014-en.pdf;;;;
OBL:63869;THE WAR IN KACHIN STATE: A YEAR OF MORE DISPLACEMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES;;"• In the past year, the Tatmadaw has deployed nearly 25% of its battalions to Kachin
State, escalating its war with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and bringing
further suffering to civilian populations in Kachin State and Northern Shan State.
• Tatmadaw soldiers have constantly targeted civilians in Kachin State and Northern
Shan States as part of their military operations against the KIA. Human rights abuses
have included extrajudicial killings, rape of women, arbitrary arrests, torture, forced
displacement, the use of human shields, forced labor, and the confiscation and
destruction of property. All of these systematic abuses would be considered war
crimes and/or crimes against humanity under international law.
• The ongoing conflict has displaced about 75,000 people, including at least 10,000
refugees who crossed the border into China. Despite the severity of the situation, the
regime has frustrated relief efforts, severely restricting humanitarian access to local
and international organizations.
• The KIA’s political leadership, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), has made
repeated attempts to negotiate a lasting peace in Kachin State. However, the regime
has rejected the KIO’s request to discuss long-term political solutions prior to a
ceasefire agreement.

OBL:48125;Burma and superpower rivalries in the Asia-Pacific;;"The Western democracies have declared that their strong stances against the current military regime in Burma reflect principled stands against the 1988 massacres of pro-democracy demonstrators, the failure of the regime to recognize the results of the 1990 general elections (which resulted in a landslide victory for the main opposition parties), and the regime?s continuing human rights abuses. Yet it can be argued that such a strong and sustained position would have been less likely had the Cold War not ended and Burma?s importance in the global competition between the superpowers not significantly waned. Lacking any pressing strategic or military reason to cultivate Burma, and with few direct political or economic interests at stake, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom can afford to isolate the Rangoon regime and impose upon it pariah status. If this was indeed the calculation made in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is possible that the changes that have occurred in the strategic environment since then may prompt a reconsideration of these policies.

Burma lies where South, Southeast, and East Asia meet; there the dominant cultures of these three subregions compete for influence. It lies also across the ?fault lines? between three major civilisations?Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian.1 At critical times in the past, Burma has been a cockpit for rivalry between superpowers. Today, in the fluid strategic environment of the early twenty-first century, its important position is once again attracting attention from analysts, officials, and military planners. Already, Burma?s close relationship with China and the development of the Burmese armed forces have reminded South and Southeast Asian countries, at least, of Burma?s geostrategic importance and prompted a markedly different approach from that of the West...""

OBL:71359;Invisible Lives - The Untold Story of Displacement Cycle in Burma - Burmese (??????????);;"Executive Summary: ""Recently, much attention surrounding Burma has focused on the democratic reform, 2015 elections and the future of the National League for Democracy (NLD)-led Government, whilst a profound humanitarian crisis and continuing concerns of the ethnic minority communities in the southeast have been largely ignored. The recent story of political and economic reform has insufficiently addressed the ongoing struggles of internally displaced persons (IDPs), as they become an inconvenient truth rendered invisible by the larger reform narrative. Nearly 70 years of ethnic conflict has created a displacement crisis with over 644,000 internally displaced and over 479,000 refugees fleeing the country predominantly from ethnic areas. At present, over 100,000 refugees live in camps along the Thailand-Burma border, and approximately 400,000 IDPs live in protracted displacement in southeast Burma. As the continuing political and social transformation in Burma and the triumph of the NLD in the 2015 elections captivates local citizens and foreign observers around the world, optimism and the infectious idea that those displaced will soon begin to move back to Burma has led to further decline in donor funding along the Thailand-Burma border. This has deeply impacted the refugees and IDPs living along the border whose lives depend on international aid as well as essential services and programs offered by local ethnic service providers, which were traditionally funded by the international donor community. Many refugees are now feeling squeezed out of the camps, bearing a resemblance to the experience of Mon refugees who were pushed back across the border to Burma and became IDPs over 20 years ago. As expressed by many Mon IDPs interviewed for this report, they have yet to find durable livelihood solutions in IDP sites and continue to suffer from chronic poverty, debt and lack of medical care. Inside Burma, stagnation in amending repressive laws, military dominance in politics, the absence of an inclusive ceasefire and political dialogue, the presence of landmines and land confiscation that has become endemic throughout the country continue to render the definition of a safe and dignified voluntary return of refugees meaningless. As plans to repatriate over 100,000 refugees along the border continue to be discussed, there is an increasing need to reflect on the past and draw lessons that could prevent a future protracted IDP situation in the country. This report aims to shed light on lessons that can be learned from the past for all stakeholders involved in all stages of planning for the return of refugees and IDPs. While the IDPs interviewed for this report expressed their desire to stay in their current locations as opposed to relocation or return to their original location, they often cited two major obstacles to their possible return: not having land to return to and continuing considerations about safety including lack of sustainable peace in their place of origin. The plight of villagers and farmers in Ye and Yebyu Township in their struggle to preserve and protect their land from the Burma Army, the State and private investors indicate that refugees and IDPs are likely to face increasing housing, land and property (HLP) rights violations upon their return. These HLP rights violations must be resolved not only to ensure the durable return of IDPs and refugees, but also to end further displacement that is adding to the already vast number of displaced people inside and out of the country. Steps must also be taken to ensure that a genuine and inclusive peace process remains a priority, as it is only through an inclusive ceasefire and sustainable peace that a durable solution can be found for the disenfranchised and displaced communities in Burma. Community-based organizations (CBOs), ethnic service providers, and grassroots movements with decades of experience and knowledge that have worked side-by-side with their communities through difficult and challenging times are tackling these very issues and concerns that the IDPs, refugees and villagers are facing. As the new NLD-led Government has begun to take the reins of the political and economic reforms set in motion by the previous government, all parties must ensure that the efforts of those who have consistently worked alongside ethnic communities are supported and advocated, and not sidelined. HLP rights of refugees and IDPs must be restored, laws that are legacies of the past must be amended, landmines must be cleared from the land and an inclusive ceasefire followed by a political solution is needed to protect them from further abuse and possible secondary displacement before a durable livelihood solution can be achieved. National reconciliation is possible only when victims begin receiving the support they need to ensure that they can rebuild their lives in safety and dignity.";;;"Human Rights Foundation of Monland;Burma Link";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;12-08-2016;my;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71359;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/HURFOM-2016-08-12-Invisible-lives-bu-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:44353;Damming at Gunpoint (English);;"BURMA ARMY ATROCITIES
PAVE THE WAY FOR SALWEEN DAMS
IN KAREN STATE...
""As Thailand proceeds with plans to join Burma’s military regime in building
a series of dams on the Salween River to gain “cheap” electricity, this report
reveals the atrocities being inflicted on the people of Northern Karen State to
pave the way for two of the planned dams.
The Upper Salween (Wei Gyi) Dam and Lower Salween (Dar Gwin) Dam
are planned to be built on the river where it forms the border between
Thailand’s Mae Hong Son province and Burma’s Karen State. Together they
will produce about 5,300 MW of electricity. It is estimated that the reservoir
for the Upper Dam will stretch for 380 kilometers inside Karen and Karenni
States of Burma.
Both dams are located at the eastern edge of Papun district in Karen State.
Once a Karen liberated area, during the last decade Papun has been the site
of repeated military offensives and anti-insurgency campaigns by the regime’s
troops to crush the Karen resistance. Before 1992, there were only ten Burma
Army garrisons in Papun district. Today there are fifty-four garrisons, including
twelve along the Salween river bank, fortified with heavy artillery.
The military campaigns have decimated the local population. 210 villages
have been destroyed, and villagers forcibly relocated to 31 relocation sites,
where movement has been strictly controlled, and villagers are subject to
forced labour and other human rights abuses. Tens of thousands of villagers
have fled to Thailand as refugees; others live in hiding in the jungle, where
they live in constant fear of being found and tortured or killed. In 1992,
there were estimated to be about 107,000 people in Papun district. Now this
has been halved to about 54,000, of whom about 35,000, or 60%, are
internally displaced in the jungles. The rest have fled to Thailand or other
parts of Burma.
Out of 85 original villages in the mountainous area of Eastern Papun
directly adjoining the planned dam sites, only a quarter remain. Most of the
communities who had farmed and traded along the Salween River have fled
to Thailand, and many farms in the fertile tributary valleys have been lying fallow for over a decade. Over 5,000 villagers remain hiding in the jungle,
facing severe food shortages and health problems. Roads to the planned dam
sites have been built using forced labour, and landmines have been planted
alongside the roads.
There has been no consultation with local communities about the dam
plans. If the dams are built, the floodwaters will permanently displace many
of the communities currently in hiding or living as refugees in Thailand. The
increased military security for the dam sites will also inevitably mean further
abuses against local populations.
The Salween dams fit into the ongoing strategy of the Burmese military
regime to use “development” projects to gain funding and collusion from
neighbouring countries to subjugate ethnic resistance movements, and exploit
the natural resources in the ethnic areas.

OBL:48050;Landmine Monitor Report 2002: Burma (Myanmar);;"Key developments since May 2001: Myanmar?s military has continued laying landmines inside the country and along its borders with Thailand. As part of a new plan to ?fence the country,? the Coastal Region Command Headquarters gave orders to its troops from Tenasserim division to lay mines along the Thai-Burma border. Three rebel groups, not previously identified as mine users, were discovered using landmines in 2002: Pao People?s Liberation Front, All Burma Muslim Union and Wa National Army. Thirteen rebel groups are now using mines. Myanmar?s ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has not acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty. Myanmar abstained from voting on the pro-Mine Ban Treaty UN General Assembly Resolution 56/24M in November 2001. SPDC delegates have not attended any of the annual meetings of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty or the intersessional Standing Committee meetings. Myanmar declined to attend the Regional Seminar of Stockpile Destruction of Anti-personnel Mines and other Munitions, held in Malaysia in August 2001. Myanmar did not respond to an invitation by the government of Malaysia to an informal meeting, held on the side of the January 2002 intersessional meetings in Geneva, to discuss the issue of landmines within the ASEAN context (other ASEAN non-signatories, such as Vietnam, did attend).

OBL:71998;Foreign Investment in Myanmar: A Resource Boom but a Development Bust?;;"... In February 2011 media outlets worldwide reported that China had surpassed Thailand as the largest foreign investor in Myanmar.1 China had US$8.25 billion of approved investment in fiscal year 2010–11 (which in Myanmar runs April to March), all for projects in the extractive and power sectors. It was the biggest investor in Myanmar’s FY2010–11 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) windfall of almost $20 billion — more than the previous twenty years combined.2 This was just slightly higher than Vietnam’s approved investments for the corresponding fiscal year, which totalled $19.9 billion.3 Yet the 2010–11 FDI figures exemplified a decade long trend of investment being overwhelmingly concentrated in the extractive (mining and oil and gas) and power sectors. Only 1 per cent of the FDI from FY2010–11 was outside these sectors, evidence that foreign investors saw few other viable investment opportunities in Myanmar’s challenging business climate. The majority of these investments came from neighbouring countries, most notably China, but also Thailand and South Korea. This is partly the result of Beijing’s often overstated but still sizable influence in Naypyidaw, as well
as its desire to secure natural resources from abroad and bypass the strategic chokepoint that is the Straits of Malacca.4 But the source of Myanmar’s FDI is also shaped by other factors, including different home country investment patterns. China, for example, is historically a major investor in resource projects. Singapore and Japan tend to invest more in sectors such as real estate and manufacturing, yet because these projects were less viable in Myanmar for the last decade, investors from these countries have often turned elsewhere. Despite oft-cited competition for resource investment in Myanmar, India’s actual investment in the country has been miniscule, though Indian investors have in recent years spent approximately 80 per cent of their FDI on mergers and acquisitions, which are rare in Myanmar.

The concentration of FDI has important implications for Myanmar’s economic development, as contrary to common perceptions FDI is not inherently or uniformly beneficial for a host country. Instead, the positives vary depending on the source and sector of investments, the forward and backward linkages they create with other parts of the economy, the number and types of jobs created, and the host country’s economic policies. Most of the FDI that has come into Myanmar in the last decade has created little direct employment and few linkages with existing industries, limiting their positive benefits. Despite this, FDI is still rightly viewed as an important part of Myanmar’s economic development.

This paper reviews changes in the source country and economic sector of FDI in Myanmar using actual and approved investment data from 1989 until 2011. The data has been disaggregated by country, sector, and for select years both. It looks at FDI in two periods: the first from the passage of the Foreign Investment Law in November 1988 to the end of FY1999–2000, and the second from FY2000–01 to the present. This division was selected because it falls at the end of a decade, during a lull in both approved and actual investment (after most of the projects approved before the 1997–98 Asian Financial Crisis had been fulfilled), and around the time when the changing trends in Myanmar’s FDI were first becoming evident. The paper starts by noting some caveats of FDI figures in Myanmar. It then reviews recent literature on FDI in Myanmar, before examining the major trends in the country’s investment data. The next section compares these trends with those of Myanmar’s neighbours, Vietnam and Laos. The paper then engages with the theoretical literature on FDI to explore what these investment patterns reveal about the macro economy, and how they are shaped by geopolitics, sanctions, commercial concerns and the specific investment patterns of each home country. The paper closes with a brief examination of whether these FDI projects can contribute to broad-based economic development in Myanmar...";Jared Bissinger;;Macquarie University;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;03-08-2012;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71998;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/2012_Bissinger_FDI_in_Myanmar_Resource_Boom_or_Development_Bust_Contemporary_Southeast_Asia__E_.pdf;;;;
OBL:58677;Displacement and disease: the Shan exodus and infectious disease implications for Thailand;;"Abstract:
""Decades of neglect and abuses by the Burmese government have decimated the health of the
peoples of Burma, particularly along her eastern frontiers, overwhelmingly populated by
ethnic minorities such as the Shan. Vast areas of traditional Shan homelands have been
systematically depopulated by the Burmese military regime as part of its counter-insurgency
policy, which also employs widespread abuses of civilians by Burmese soldiers, including
rape, torture, and extrajudicial executions. These abuses, coupled with Burmese government
economic mismanagement which has further entrenched already pervasive poverty in rural
Burma, have spawned a humanitarian catastrophe, forcing hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Shan villagers to flee their homes for Thailand. In Thailand, they are denied refugee status
and its legal protections, living at constant risk for arrest and deportation. Classified as
“economic migrants,” many are forced to work in exploitative conditions, including in the
Thai sex industry, and Shan migrants often lack access to basic health services in Thailand.
Available health data on Shan migrants in Thailand already indicates that this population
bears a disproportionately high burden of infectious diseases, particularly HIV, tuberculosis,
lymphatic filariasis, and some vaccine-preventable illnesses, undermining progress made by
Thailand’s public health system in controlling such entities. The ongoing failure to address
the root political causes of migration and poor health in eastern Burma, coupled with the
many barriers to accessing health programs in Thailand by undocumented migrants,
particularly the Shan, virtually guarantees Thailand’s inability to sustainably control many
infectious disease entities, especially along her borders with Burma.";Voravit Suwanvanichkij;;Conflict and Health 2008, 2:4;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;14-03-2008;en;"land governance;local community;land policies;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/58677;http://www.conflictandhealth.com/content/2/1/4;;;;
OBL:72097;Institutional Models for a Future Recognition and Registration of Customary (Communal) Tenure in Myanmar;;"Paper prepared for presentation at the 2016 WORLD BANK CONFERENCE ON LAND AND POVERTY, The World Bank - Washington DC, March 14-18, 2016
The paper is based on the study on customary tenure for LCG in Chin and Shan States 2013-2015 in brief periods. The relevance of the topic was grounded in a wish to 1) identify statutory means to protect the livelihood of ethnic upland communities in Myanmar from losing, in particular, their shifting cultivation fallow land to agribusiness concessions; 2) based on results from fieldwork, to guide the Government towards recognizing customary (communal) tenure in the drafting of the National Land Use Policy (NLUP) with the ultimate aim of recommending procedures for customary (communal) land registration in a future new Land Law and associated Rules 3); to define how to recognize boundaries of shifting cultivation parcels in a customary system of fair but variable annual local land sharing.

""... In Myanmar land issues are of paramount importance after years of land grabbing by the military and business cronies. A rapid anthropological study 2013-14 in Chin and Shan State for the Land Core Group was carried out to inform the post 2011 government. The study recorded the internal rules of customary communal tenure and identified possible statutory means of protecting untitled land, including fallows, against alienation. The Land Core Group guided the Government Committee during 2014-15 to recognize customary tenure in drafting of the National Land Use Policy, not yet endorsed. The study recommended conversion of the community into a legal entity/organization registering all its agricultural land, while keeping separate and intact its customary internal rules. The study construed a reading of existing regulatory framework in support. The study proved, though, that precise mapping of large tracts of shifting cultivation land is difficult due to annual diversity of fuzzy boundaries...

OBL:72095;Current Situation and Future Opportunities in Agricultural Education, Research and Extension in Myanmar;;"... Myanmar is an agricultural based country and the agriculture sector is the backbone of its economy. The agriculture sector contributes 34% of GDP, 23% of total export earnings, and employs 63% of the labour force. About 75% of the total population reside in rural areas and are
principally employed in the agriculture, livestock and fishery sectors for their livelihood.

Rice is the most important dominating crop and is grown in saline area mostly found in lower Myanmar especially in Ayeyarwady, Yangon, Taninthayi Divisions and also in Yakhine and Mon States. Deep-water rice is usually grown in areas of some restricted belts in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Taninthayi Divisions and Rakhine, Mon and Kayin States. Out of the total crop sown area of 10 million hectares, about 13% is under irrigation. The rest of the land has to rely on the rain for crop production.

The population will grow to about 60 million by the year 2010 and the demand for local rice consumption alone, will be in the proximate of 20 millions tons. To be able to supply enough food for the increasing population and export the surplus, rice production will have to be increased up to 25 millions tons, by expanding the rice growing area up to 6 millions hectare. This scheme will further be enhanced by the adoption of modern proven technologies and
provision of the required inputs in full.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation is making all-out efforts for the development of agriculture, taking measures as: efficient utilization of land and water resources; farm mechanization; introduction of new technologies; and supply of farm inputs. Agriculture being
the largest economy of the country, the Ministry tries to stimulate public awareness and interest for better participation and investment in the sector.

The government of the Union of Myanmar remains committed to the contribution of national as well as world food security. The Agriculture sector in Myanmar occupies a dominant position in the development of the national economy, and has a definite bearing on other socio-economic
activities. Because of the high potential of land, water resources, man power resources and other mineral resources, Myanmar has been prominent as an agricultural country for many years and will continue to be so in the future.

Given the importance of agriculture in Myanmar, agricultural education, research and extension are important priorities. In the process of developing the agricultural sector, conducting training and offering educational programs of international standard are crucial to the development of human resources...";Khin Mar Cho;;Myanmar Development Resource Institute - Centre for Economic and Social Development (MDRI-CESD);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;28-02-2013;en;"food security;farmers;rural population;sustainable development;poverty;rural development;local community";"Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Access to Land & Tenure Security;"001;MMR";Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72095;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/Ref_Doc_Background_Paper_5_Current_Situation_and_Future_Opportunities_Mar2013.pdf;;;;
OBL:72094;Food and Nutrition Security in Myanmar;;"... This background paper was commissioned by USAID as part of a Strategic Agricultural Sector and Food Security Diagnostic for Myanmar, led by Michigan State University and in partnership with the Myanmar Development Resource Institute ? Centre for Economic and Social Development (MDRI?CESD). The broad objectives of the Diagnostic are to improve USAID’s understanding of the major constraints to
agricultural sector performance and to food security of vulnerable households in Myanmar, and to outline core strategies USAID should consider as it designs policies and programs to stimulate broadbased agricultural growth and enhance food security. In support of these aims, this background paper synthesizes the best available data and information on poverty, nutrition, and vulnerability to food
insecurity in Myanmar to identify key vulnerable populations, and outlines a set of strategic options to
improve the food security of the most vulnerable households.

This synthesis is based on a rapid assessment conducted during a three?week field visit (October 28 to November 17, 2012), and pre? and post?field visit desk research. The research draws from three broad types of information: 1) national surveys on poverty, malnutrition, and health outcomes; 2) food security assessments conducted by UN agencies, donors, and Non?governmental Organizations (NGOs)
in select geographic areas; 3) and semi?structured qualitative interviews with key stakeholders across seven of the 14 states/regions in Myanmar’s Delta, Dry Zone, and hilly regions that the team accessed during the field visit.

Data availability and reliability are major constraints to proper assessment in Myanmar. The Government of Myanmar (GOM) has not conducted a population census since 1983 and this inaction casts doubt on all other survey work since. The world’s longest running civil war and military?government policies have restricted surveyors’ access to many parts of the country; even the two relatively reliable surveys intended to document poverty and nutrition conditions face these limitations. Very few surveys provide
sex?disaggregated data, which limits analysis of gender aspects of poverty and vulnerability.

The authors fully recognize this obstacle and yet are in agreement with one long?time observer of Myanmar; the data may not be rigorous but are “good enough to program against.” This synthesis therefore intends to provide a broad brush picture of the landscape of poverty, malnutrition, and vulnerability across Myanmar and focuses on providing a typology of vulnerability to inform USAID’s
initial dialogue about possible program and policy design to improve household food security...";"Shannon Wilson

It was actually one of the first detailed reports on any of the post 1988 environmental issues by any Burmese- or border- based organisation, and is of particular interest in the light of the current opposition to the Irrawaddy dam projects...
""Officials of the Thai government and the SLORC military regime have for some years now been planning a series of huge energy joint ventures to be undertaken in some of the most fought over territory in Burma. The energy projects, if they are endorsed by the Thai Government - and implemented with the participation of Japanese and Western corporations - will have extremely serious, possibly even terminal repercussions for the Burmese pro-democracy movement which is based in these same areas of the Burma -Thai border. Indeed, this seems to be what a number of the proponents of the development projects intend to achieve, particularly the generals in Rangoon. The SLORC, as well as politicians, military men and businessmen in Thailand and abroad would garner great benefit from the destruction of the Burmese opposition groups along the border, and the opening of the way to even more unrestrained natural resource exploitation than is currently taking place.
There are ten planned energy development joint ventures, comprising two offshore natural gasfield developments and eight hydro-electric dams. These are: •The Martaban Gasfield developments led by Total CFP of France •The Yetagun Gasfield exploratory program led by Texaco of the US •The Upper Salween Dam, •The Lower Salween Dam •The Nam Kok Project •The Nam Moei 3 Project •The Nam Moei 2 Project •The Klong Kra Project •The Nam Moei 1 Project, and •The Nam Mae Sai Project...
The energy projects will lead to environmental and social havoc on a scale comparable to the largest development projects in the world. Indeed, the Upper Salween Dam will be among the largest in the world. Altogether the projects will directly result in the flooding and deforesting of thousands of square kilometers of the forests bordering Burma and Thailand. The projects will displace many thousands of indigenous peoples, some of them already refugees from the forty-five years of bloody civil war in Burma. Many have already been affected by military operations of the SLORC and Thai armies, operations which can easily be seen in the context of clearing the way for the development of the 820-1,000 kilometre gas pipeline or the construction of the eight dams...
The energy projects will put billions of dollars into the control of an ultra-nationalist military regime that is one of the world's worst human rights violators and that is rapidly building up a large and extraordinarily aggressive army which poses a significant threat to the stability of the region. The massive input of funds from the Western and Japanese multinational oil and energy development companies, combined with the cheap sale and presents of Chinese weaponry, and the profits from the heroin traffic that the SLORC is alleged to control, has funded this huge expansion of the SLORC armed forces...
The energy joint ventures will, if signed, mark the second and higher level of engagement in the much criticised ASEAN policy of ""constructive engagement"" towards the SLORC regime, which through the activities of the logging, oil and fishing companies have already caused untold damage to Burma's environment. The multinational corporations, the Keidanrens
and the Thai state oil and electricity institutes PTT and EGAT are therefore amongst the most powerful influences supporting the SLORC in its brutal and undemocratic suppression of the peoples of Burma.";;;Green November 32;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-08-1993;en;"land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/66419;http://burmalibrary.org/docs12/Deadly_Energy-ocr.pdf;;;;

OBL:50698;Total Denial - A Report on the Yadana Pipeline Project in Burma;;"#039;Total Denial' catalogues the systematic human rights abuses and environmental degradation perpetrated by SLORC as the regime seeks to consolidate its power base in the gas pipeline region. Further, the report shows that investment in projects such as the Yadana pipeline not only gives tacit approval and support to the repressive SLORC junta but also exacerbates the grave human rights and environmental problems in Burma.... The research indicates that gross human rights violations, including summary executions, torture, forced labor and forced relocations, have occurred as a result of natural gas development projects funded by European and North American corporations. In addition to condemning transnational corporate complicity with the SLORC regime, the report also presents the perspectives of those most directly impacted by the foreign investment who for too long have silently endured the abuses meted out by SLORC for the benefit of its foreign corporate partners."" ...Additional keywords: environment, human rights violations.";;;"EarthRights International;Southeast Asian Information Network (SAIN)";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;10-07-1996;en;"local community;land use;displacement;extractive industries;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/50698;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/Total_Denial.pdf;;;;

Since the publication of ""Uprooting the Shan,"" the report by the SHRF detailing the forced relocation program carried out by the SLORC in Shan State during 1996, the SLORC military regime (recently renamed the State Peace and Development Council or SPDC) has been continuing to uproot more villages throughout 1997 and early 1998. Many of the relocation sites that were the results of 1996 relocations have been forced to move again. Human rights abuses such as mass killings, rape, torture and looting have been committed repeatedly by the SPDC troops against the displaced population. This has prompted the need to publish this updated report, containing more complete lists and maps of the relocated villages, and detailing the many extrajudicial killings committed by the military regime in the areas of relocation.

This is however a conservative figure, and there is no information available on figures for internally displaced people (IDPs) in several parts of the country.
In 2008, the displacement crisis continued to be most acute in Kayin (Karen) State in the east of the country where an intense offensive by the Myanmar army against ethnic insurgent groups had been ongoing since late 2005. As of October 2008, there were reportedly over 100,000 IDPs in the state.
New displacement was also reported in 2008 in western Myanmar’s Chin State as a result of human rights violations and severe food insecurity. People also continued to be displaced in some parts of the country due to a combination of coercive measures such as forced labour and land confiscation that left them with no choice but to migrate, often in the context of state-sponsored development initiatives.
IDPs living in the areas of Myanmar still affected by armed conflict between the army and insurgent groups remained the most vulnerable, with their priority needs tending to be related to physical security, food, shelter, health and education. Humanitarian access to this population continued to be very restricted.
An unprecedented level of access for humanitarian workers was permitted in response to Cyclone Nargis which struck the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) Delta in May 2008, but government restrictions on humanitarian access continued elsewhere in Myanmar and frustrated efforts to reach conflict-affected IDPs. Additionally, the awareness of the international community of the nature and extent of conflict-displacement in Myanmar continued to be limited.";;;Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-03-2009;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/57246;http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/7D254C15EAE79AD7C1257570003C57E0/$file/Myanmar+-+March+2009.pdf;;;;
OBL:60496;Supply and Command - Natural gas in western Burma set to entrench military rule;;"Executive Summary""
""A scramble for natural gas presently unfolding in western Burma is poised to provide the ruling military junta with its single largest source of income. The sale of the gas, mainly to regional neighbours, will further entrench the junta, insulating it from international pressure. The country's already abysmal human rights situation is set to worsen.
A consortium of Indian and Korean corporations, in cooperation with the regime, has been exploring gas fields off the coast of Arakan State after the discovery of a ""world class gas deposit"" in wells labelled ""Shwe"" (the Burmese word for gold) in late 2003. The Shwe wells are expected to lead to one of the largest gas yields in Southeast Asia. Burma's strategic location between two of the world's largest and most energy-hungry countries (China and India) has accelerated the exploration and extraction process.
Outcry over Burma's human rights record and its continued detention of democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has led to a series of actions by the international community, including moves to highlight Burma as a security threat at the UN Security Council. Yet the regime has continued its military expansion and offensives, particularly into ethnic border areas, in an effort to strengthen its hold. Since 1988, the number of infantry battalions based in the Western Command in Arakan and Chin states, the two western states that will be affected by the Shwe gas project, has increased from 3 to 43 battalions.
The increased militarization has led to human rights abuses including forced labour, confiscation of land and assets, extortion,
and violence. These abuses will surely be exacerbated by a further increase of troop levels to secure any gas pipeline in the area. Indeed, the effects of the project are already being felt by local fishermen. In April 2004, soldiers arrested fishermen inside an exclusion zone around exploratory rigs in the gas fields. The men were not aware of the restrictions as they had frequently gone fishing in that area. Regardless of this, they were beaten and thrown injail.
Gas from the Yadana and Yetagun pipelines in the east of the country is currently Burma's largest source of legal export revenue. The Shwe project, however, would increase the junta's income from gas by at least 150%. The junta stands to profit by approximately US$580-824 million per year or US$124 7 billion over the life of the project. Previous gas earnings have been directly linked with military arms purchases and allow the regime to continue its oppressive grip on the whole of Burma's population in defiance of international pressure.
While the regime purchases more arms with gas revenues, the local population remains in poverty. Arakan and Chin states are both excluded from the national electricity grid; ninety percent of the population uses candles for light and firewood as their primary source of cooking fuel. People are denied their rights to participate in decision-making about any development projects, including the extraction of local resources.
Two proposed pipeline routes to India traverse four areas classified as crucial to the conservation of global biodiversity, including one of the ten most vulnerable ecoregions in the world. Clearance paths either side of a pipeline that would disrupt animal migratory paths and the building of roads and infrastructure are â€¢ foreign governments, institutions, and civil society,
of particular concern in these areas. The fate of at least three particularly in the region, to pressure businesses
critically endangered animal species, the Arakan forest turtle, involved in the Shwe gas project to freeze all current
the dugong, and the Irrawaddy river dolphin, will also be put into business with the military regime and refrain from
question by the Shwe project. Environmental dangers involved further investment.
in the commercial production and transport of natural gas such
as chemical leakage and gas blowouts are a further concern. â€¢ the broader international community to continue to
expose the dangers posed by the Shwe gas project. Several ancient historical sites - including the third Dhanyawaddy City that dates back to 580 BC - that are significant not only to Arakan people but to the understanding of the history of Southeast Asia lie within twenty kilometres of the proposed Shwe gas pipelines. Given the SPDC's record of destruction and disregard for culturally and historically important sites, including those in Arakan State, this proximity makes them vulnerable to ransacking and destruction during the development of the Shwe pipelines and associated infrastructure such as roads and military barracks.
In order to address the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts of the Shwe gas project and to enable its benefits to be distributed equitably, Burma needs a democratic system of governance in which people can voice their concerns without fearing persecution. Without this, the Shwe project must not go forward.
The Shwe Gas Movement urges:
â€¢ all corporations and businesses involved in the Shwe project, either state or privately owned, to freeze all current business with the military regime and refrain from further investment and exploration until a dialogue can be held with a democratically-elected government.";;;Shwe Gas Movement;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-06-2006;en;"land investments;extractive industries";Land & Investments;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60496;http://burmacampaign.org.uk/media/shwe_gas.pdf;;;;

The villager interviewed Maung R---, a 31-year-old village head, who described extensive demands for forced labour, specifically for villagers to porter military rations, produce thatch shingles and bamboo poles, and tend to plantations owned by Border Guard soldiers. He also detailed demands for money including mandatory payments in lieu of recruitment for portering duties and arbitrary taxation. Threats against villagers were used to ensure compliance with these demands. Past instances of forced recruitment into the Border Guard were mentioned, as well as cases of direct violence, including an attack against villagers with three reported deaths. Other concerns expressed include the absence of basic medical care, and the poor quality of farmland which contributes to food insecurity and can force villagers to seek daily wage work in order to meet their basic food requirements. To mitigate this insecurity villagers employ a range of tactics including the sharing of food, as described by Maung R--- below.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;29-02-2012;en;food security;Land & Food Security;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64622;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2012/khrg12b20.pdf;;;;

It discusses augmented troop rotations, resupply operations and the sending of bulldozers to construct a new vehicle road between the 20-mile point on the Toungoo – Kler La road and Kler La. It also contains reports of forced labour, specifically the use of villagers to porter military equipment and supplies, to serve as set tha, and the clearing of vegetation by vehicle roads. Movement restrictions were also highlighted as a major concern for villagers living both within and outside state control, as the imposition of permission documents and taxes limits the transportation of cash crops, and impacts the availability of basic commodities. The villager who wrote this report raised villagers' concerns about rising food prices, the lack of medicine due to government restrictions on its transportation from towns to mountainous areas, and the difficulty in obtaining an education in rural villages beyond grades three and four. The villager who wrote this report flagged the ongoing use of landmines by armed groups and noted that this poses serious physical security risks, particularly where villagers are not notified of landmine-contaminated areas, but also noted that some villagers view the use of landmines by non-state armed groups in positive terms as a deterrent of Tatmadaw activity.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-03-2012;en;"land conflicts;mining;food security;land use;extractive industries";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64621;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2012/khrg12b22.pdf;;;;
OBL:75645;Legal Memorandum: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity in Eastern Myanmar;;"Conclusion:
""...This memorandum describes a Myanmar military counterinsurgency offensive that
involved the widespread targeting of civilians in northern Kayin State and eastern Bago
Division. Myanmar Army soldiers fired mortars at villages, opened fire on fleeing
villagers, destroyed homes, laid landmines in civilian locations, forced villagers to work
and porter, and captured and executed civilians. The impact on the population was
massive. Tens of thousands of individuals were displaced during the campaign and many
were killed. In Thandaung Township—the area which was the focus of the Clinic’s
investigation—nearly every village was affected by the Offensive and almost all of the
villagers residing in black areas were forced to flee.
Evidence collected by the Clinic during the investigation demonstrates that the actions
of Myanmar Army personnel during the Offensive constitute crimes under international
criminal law. These crimes include the war crimes of attacking civilians, displacing
civilians, destroying or seizing the enemy’s property, pillage, murder, execution without
due process, torture, and outrages upon personal dignity, and the crimes against
humanity of forcible transfer of a population, murder, enslavement, torture, and other
inhumane acts. The Clinic has also collected evidence relevant to the war crime of rape,
as well as the crimes against humanity of rape and persecution. More research and
analysis is necessary to determine whether these crimes could be included in a criminal
case associated with the Offensive...";;;International Human Rights Clinic at Harvard Law School;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-11-2014;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75645;http://burmalibrary.org/docs19/2014.11.05-IHRC-War_Crimes%26Crimes_against_Humanity-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:64001;Land Grabs Intensify as Burma ‘Reform’ Races Ahead of Law;;"While foreign governments heap praise on the Burmese government’s liberal tilt, land theft appears to be increasing as state agencies and powerfully placed domestic firms position themselves to welcome foreign investment.

Farmers across the country are being muscled out of their fields with little hope of appeal to the law. This is because despite all the trumpeting in the West about President Thein Sein’s “reforms,” the rule of law in Burma is closer to 12th Century Europe than the 21st Century.

In medieval Europe, land ownership was determined by sharp swords and private armies. In present-day Burma, powerful businesses linked to the army do much the same.

Land confiscation is being reported near the south coast, in the Rangoon region, around Mandalay and in northern areas close to the border with China.

Farmers and their families are being forcibly moved for major projects, such as the oil and gas pipelines being built through the country from the Bay of Bengal to the Chinese border, and for smaller industrial projects by firms with long crony links to the military.

Even where the local authorities have sided with expelled farmers, big businesses feel confident enough to ignore them.

The reports register villagers' serious concerns about food security in hiding areas beyond Tatmadaw control, caused by effective limits on access to arable land due to the risk of attack when villagers cultivating land proximate to Tatmadaw camps, depletion of soil fertility in cultivable areas, and a drought during the 2010 rainy season which triggered widespread paddy crop failure.[2] To address the threat of Tatmadaw attacks targeting villagers, their food stores and livelihoods activities, villagers reported that they form gher der groups to monitor and communicate Tatmadaw activity; utilise early-warning systems; and communicate amongst themselves and with non-state armed groups to share information about Tatmadaw troop movements. Two villagers stated that the deployment of landmines by gher der groups and KNLA soldiers prevents access to civilian areas by Tatmadaw troops and facilitates security for villagers to pursue their agricultural activities.

""The situation faced by the villagers of Toungoo District (see Map 1) is worsening as more and more parts of the District are being brought under the control of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) through the increased militarisation of the region. At any one time there are no fewer than a dozen battalions active in the area. Widespread forced labour and extortion continue unabated as in previous years, with all battalions in the District being party to such practices. The imposition of constant forced labour and the extortion of money and food are among the military’s primary occupations in the area. The strategy of the military is not one of open confrontation with the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) – the armed wing of the Karen National Union (KNU) - but of targeting the civilian population as a means of cutting all lines of support and supply for the resistance movement. There has not been a major offensive in the District since the SPDC launched Operation Aung Tha Pyay in 1995-96; however since that time the Army has been restricting, harassing, and forcibly relocating hill villages to the point where people can no longer live in them. Many of the battalions launch sweeps through the hills in search of villagers hiding there in an effort to drive them out of the hills and into the areas controlled by the SPDC.

OBL:57331;THE IMPACT OF CHINA ON SOUTHEAST ASIAN FORESTS;;"ABSTRACT:
Some countries have gained control of their forest-exploiting industries through
advanced regulatory regimes. But stricter regulation usually displaces forestexploitation
into countries with weaker regulatory regimes. The most important
current example is the shift of forest-exploitation for the Chinese market from
China into Southeast Asia following the logging ban in China in 1998. In this
paper we describe and document the impact of the logging ban after the 1998
floods: declining production within China, and increasing production for the
Chinese market within Southeast Asia, including both legal and illegal logging.
We also note the differences in the impact of the Chinese demand for forest
products on various Southeast Asian countries. The differences are partly the
result of differences in the levels of corruption, local political economy, and state
regulatory capacity among countries in Southeast Asia.";"Graeme Lang

OBL:49339;Mines and Communities Website;;"The Mines and Communities Website (""MAC"") was initiated by
members of the Minewatch Asia-Pacific London support group. Its main aim is to ensure easy access to materials published by the group, as well as partner organisations and individuals.

 We want to make information on mining impacts, projects, and the
 corporate sector more widely available. Above all, we hope to empower
 mining-affected communities, so that they can better fight against
 damaging proposals and practices. 

 The website is supported by: JATAM (Mining Advocacy Network,
 Indonesia), Mines, Minerals and People (India), Minewatch Asia Pacific
 Project (Philippines), Partizans (People against Rio Tinto Zinc and Its
 Subsidiaries, UK), Philippine Indigenous Peoples Links (UK), the
 Society of St. Columban (UK) and Third World Network Ghana. These
 organisations are also represented on the editorial group which will
 submit and monitor new information and contacts on which this website
 can build......See the Country page for several dozen articles and reports on mining in Burma.

The villager described an incident that occurred in October 2011 in which Tatmadaw soldiers fired six mortar shells into an area in which civilians are actively seeking to avoid attacks by Tatmadaw troops; no one was killed or injured during the attack. This situation update places the occurrence of such incidents in the context of the repeated and prolonged displacement of villagers in northern Luthaw who continue to actively seek to avoid contact with government troops due to ongoing attacks against civilian objects. The villager who wrote this report raised concerns about food shortages in hiding site areas where the presence of Tatmadaw soldiers proximate to previously cultivated land has resulted in overcrowding on available farmland and the subsequent degradation of soil quality, severely limiting villagers' abilities to support themselves using traditional rotational cropping methods.

OBL:59159;Displacement and Dispossession: Forced Migration and Land Rights in Burma;;"According to COHRE's new report, 'Displacement and Dispossession: Forced Migration and Land Rights in Burma', land confiscation by Government forces is responsible for many serious housing, land and property (HLP) rights violations in Burma. These abuses occur during military counter-insurgency operations; to clear land for the construction of new army bases; to make way for infrastructure development projects; to facilitate natural resource extraction; and to cater for the vested interests of business.
 
'Displacement and Dispossession: Forced Migration and Land Rights in Burma' also reveals that control of land is a key strategy for the military regime, and a means of promoting the on-going expansion of the Burmese Army (Tatmadaw). In 1998, the SPDC issued a directive instructing Tatmadaw battalions to become self-sufficient in rice and other basic provisions. This prompted the Tatmadaw to 'live off the land' by appropriating resources (food, cash, labour, land) from the civilian population. This policy has exacerbated conflict and displacement across much of rural Burma.
 
The Thai Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) and its partners estimate that during 2007, approximately 76,000 people have been newly displaced by armed conflict and associated human rights abuses. The majority of new incidents of forced migration and village destruction were concentrated in northeast Karen State and adjacent areas of Pegu Division. The total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Eastern Burma in October 2007 was 503,000. These included 295,000 people in ceasefire zones, 99,000 IDPs 'in hiding' in the jungle and 109,000 in relocation sites. The estimates exclude hundreds of thousands of IDPs in other parts of Burma (especially Kachin and Shan States, and the west of the country, as well as in some parts of Karen State). Including these figures would bring the total to over a million internally displaced people. 
 
COHRE's Du Plessis said, ""More than one million people have been dispossessed and are internally displaced in Burma -- not because of a natural disaster, but due to their own government's calculated and brutal actions. We have here a state monopoly which forcibly transfers property, income and assets, from rural, non-Burman ethnic nationalities to an elite, military Government. The HLP violations found in Burma today are the result of short-sighted and predatory policies that date back to the early years of Independence, and to the period of colonial rule. These problems can only be resolved through substantial and sustained change in Burma. Political transition should include improved access to a range of fundamental rights, as enshrined in international law and conventions -- including respect for HLP rights.";;;Coalition on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-12-2007;en;"farmland;land policies;property rights;expropriation;land use planning;farming systems;land governance;land law;land grabbing;displacement;land tenure systems;land rights;indigenous peoples;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59159;http://www.ashleysouth.co.uk/files/COHRE_November_2007.pdf;;;;
OBL:76693;Myanmar: comprehensive solutions needed for recent and long-term IDPs alike;;"Executive summary:

""IDMC estimates that there are up to 642,600 internally displaced people (IDPs) in Myanmar, forced to flee their homes by armed conflict and inter-communal violence. The figure includes up to 400,000 people living in protracted displacement as a result of conflict in the south-east of the country – in southern Shan, Kayah, Kayin and Mon states and Bago and Tanintharyi regions - and 98,000 displaced by conflict in Kachin and northern Shan states since 2011. It also includes around 140,000 people displaced by inter-communal violence in Rakhine state since 2012, and more than 5,000 who fled their homes in Mandalay region in 2013. Disasters brought on by natural hazards and forced evictions linked to land grabs and the exploitation of natural resources have caused further displacement, including in areas where people have already fled conflict and violence.

Landmines and unexploded ordnance constitute a significant obstacle to IDPs’ return in Kachin, northern Shan and the south-east. Internally displaced women and girls in Kachin and northern Shan face the threat of sexual violence. Muslim IDPs in Rakhine are confined to camps, where they have little or no access to health care, education or livelihoods, and shelters are in need of maintenance in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan. In the south-east, on the other hand, many IDPs are thought to be well on their way to achieving durable solutions through return or local integration, but estimating their number and gauging their outstanding needs is a challenge.

Myanmar has no policy or legislation on internal displacement, and the government’s response has varied from region to region. Following the signing of ceasefire agreements, IDPs in the south-east should be better consulted and should be enabled to participate more in peace negotiations to ensure that their needs and aspirations in terms of durable solutions are addressed. UN mechanisms such as clusters and sectors coordinate the international response in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan, but generally humanitarian access is difficult in Rakhine, and in areas of Kachin and northern Shan not under government control.";Anne-Kathrin Glatz;;Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-07-2014;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/76693;http://www.internal-displacement.org/south-and-south-east-asia/myanmar/2014/myanmar-comprehensive-solutions-needed-for-recent-and-long-term-idps-alike;;;;

OBL:63320;“The Government Could Have Stopped This” - Sectarian Violence and Ensuing Abuses in Burma’s Arakan State;;"Summary:
""In June 2012, deadly sectarian violence erupted in western Burma’s Arakan State between
ethnic Arakan Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims (as well as non-Rohingya Muslims). The
violence broke out after reports circulated that on May 28 an Arakan woman was raped and
killed in the town of Ramri allegedly by three Muslim men. Details of the crime were
circulated locally in an incendiary pamphlet, and on June 3, a large group of Arakan
villagers in Toungop stopped a bus and brutally killed 10 Muslims on board. Human Rights
Watch confirmed that local police and soldiers stood by and watched the killings without
intervening.
On June 8, thousands of Rohingya rioted in Maungdaw town after Friday prayers, destroying
Arakan property and killing an unknown number of Arakan residents. Sectarian violence
then quickly swept through the Arakan State capital, Sittwe, and surrounding areas.
Mobs from both communities soon stormed unsuspecting villages and neighborhoods,
killing residents and destroying homes, shops, and houses of worship. With little to no
government security present to stop the violence, people armed themselves with swords,
spears, sticks, iron rods, knives, and other basic weapons, taking the law into their own
hands. Vast stretches of property from both communities were razed. The government
claimed that 78 people were killed—an undoubtedly conservative figure—while more than
100,000 people were displaced from their homes. The hostilities were fanned by
inflammatory anti-Muslim media accounts and local propaganda.
During the period after the rape and killing was reported and before the violence broke out,
tensions had risen dramatically in Arakan State. However, local residents from each
community told Human Rights Watch that the Burmese authorities provided no protection
and did not appear to have taken any special measures to preempt the violence.
On June 10, fearing the unrest would spread beyond the borders of Arakan State, Burmese
President Thein Sein announced a state of emergency, transferring civilian power to the
Burmese army in affected areas of the state. At this point, a wave of concerted violence by
various state security forces against Rohingya communities began. For example, Rohingya
in Narzi quarter—the largest Muslim area in Sittwe, home to 10,000 Muslims—described
“THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS” 2
how Arakan mobs burned down their homes on June 12 while the police and paramilitary
Lon Thein forces opened fire on them with live ammunition. In northern Arakan State, the
Nasaka border guard force, the army, police, and Lon Thein committed killings, mass
arrests, and looting against Rohingya.
In the aftermath, local Arakan leaders and members of the Arakan community in Sittwe

It is recognized that the three regional reviews of both published and unpublished sources and the issues analyses which constitute this document are not complete. However, it was decided to publish this material in order to present information known to date and identify gaps in our understanding of this important topic.

Each of the authors describes and analyses the local systems of Common Forest Resource Management and the role of externally sponsored assistance, particularly through projects. Key issues are highlighted such as systems of tree and land tenure, the general erosion of traditional rights, the reactions of rightholders to change, and measures taken to assert old rights or establish new ones. Rather than examining the same issues across regions, the regional chapters work to highlight the key issues for each given geographic zone.

OBL:72087;Gendered Aspects of Land Rights in Myanmar;;"... Namati offers this brief in the hope that Myanmar’s national reforms and the implementation of the country’s new National Land Use Policy can grow from the lived experience of ordinary Myanmar citizens. Namati and our partners assist farmers in Myanmar to claim their land rights through a community paralegal approach. Community paralegals are trained in relevant laws, community education, negotiation, and mediation skills to work with farmers to resolve a variety of land rights issues. Dozens of data points are documented as part of each case resolution process that illustrate how the legal framework functions in practice. It is this casework data that underpins this policy brief. Focus groups and interviews with paralegals and clients further provide qualitative context and insights.

Namati recommends actions the Myanmar government can take as part of implementing its new National Land Use Policy to help increase women’s engagement in land use management and access to tenure rights. This briefing also provides recommendations for civil society organizations interested in the community paralegal model, and, in particular, in increasing the number of women paralegals in the country as a means of women’s empowerment...";;;Namati;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-03-2016;en;"land governance;land grabbing;land tenure;forestry;land rights;security of tenure (land);land tenure systems";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72087;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/Namati-Genderplicybrief-eng-FINAL.pdf;;;;
OBL:72088;Agrarian Transitions in Two Agroecosystems of Kayah State, Myanmar;;"... Located on Myanmar’s eastern border with Thailand, Kayah State has long been isolated because of conflicts between the minority groups there and the Burmese army; as a result, little is known about its agricultural systems. As a preliminary to NGO agricultural development projects, an agrarian diagnosis of two major types of agroecosystems in the state—lowlands alluvial plains and uplands—was conducted. The objective was to identify recent agrarian changes leading to the current presence of different types of farmers in each area and understand their development potential.

Both agroecosystems have followed very different evolutionary trajectories, mainly because of politico-historical factors. In the lowlands, farmers with irrigated plots are administratively obliged to grow irrigated rice, while others who are forced to grow flooded rice but unable to irrigate can diversify into vegetable growing. In the uplands, communications infrastructures allowing access to the market are a source of differentiation between villages. Farmers who have this access are growing cash crops such as maize and pigeon peas, while those who do not have access continue with upland rice-based systems.

The introduction of perennial crops such as rubber, non-perishable food production in the uplands, and horticultural diversification in the lowlands are waiting for future policies at the national level...";"Audrey Aldebert &amp; Gauvain Meulle";;Mercy Corps;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2013;en;"farmers;rural population;sustainable development;land tenure;poverty;rural development;security of tenure (land);local community;land tenure systems";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72088;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/Report_Agrarian_Transitions_Diagnosis_in_Kayah_State_Mercy_Corps_Nov2013.pdf;;;;

The letter concerns the Burma/Myanmar government’s construction of buildings on a Christian church compound. According to the letter, the compound has belonged to the church for 55 years. The Burma/Myanmar government has begun construction of a Cooperative Department building and plans to construct a Department of Rural Development building and commission offices within the church compound. This has been done without prior consultation with the Shwegyin Karen Baptist Association.

OBL:66554;MYANMAR: Displacement continues in context of armed conflicts (Overview);;"In November 2010 the first national elections since 1990 were held in Myanmar. While
the party set up by the previous government and the armed forces retain most legislative
and executive power, the elections may nevertheless have opened up a window of
opportunity for greater civilian governance and power-sharing. At the same time, recent
fighting between opposition non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and government forces in
Kayin/Karen, Kachin, and Shan States, which displaced many within eastern Myanmar and
into Thailand and China, is a sign that ethnic tensions remain serious and peace elusive.
Since April 2009, armed conflict between the armed forces and NSAGs has intensified, as
several NSAGs that had concluded a ceasefire with the government in the 1990s refused
to obey government orders to transform into army-led border guard forces.
Displacement in the context of armed conflict is not systematically monitored by any
independent organisation inside the country. Most available information on displacement
comes from organisations based on the Thai side of the Thailand-Myanmar border.
Limited access to affected areas and lack of independent monitoring make it virtually
impossible to verify their reports of the numbers and situations of internally displaced
people (IDPs). Although the conflicts in other areas of Myanmar have probably also led
to displacement, the only region for which estimates have been available was the southeast,
where more than 400,000 people were believed to be living in internal displacement
in 2010. More than 70,000 among them were estimated to be newly displaced.
People displaced due to conflict in Myanmar lack access to food, clean water, health care,
education and livelihoods. Their security is threatened by ongoing fighting, including
where conflict parties reportedly target civilians directly. Although the limited access of
humanitarians to most conflict-affected areas has hampered the provision of assistance
and protection, the Government of Myanmar took a positive step in 2010 by concluding
an agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the
provision of assistance to conflict-affected communities.";;;Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;19-07-2011;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/66554;http://burmalibrary.org/docs11/IDMC-Myanmar_Overview_July2011.pdf;;;;
OBL:75807;A political anatomy of land grabs;;"The phrase “land grab” has become common in Myanmar, often making front page news. This reflects the more open political space available to talk about injustices, as well as the escalating severity and degree of land dispossession under the new government.

But this seemingly simple two-word phrase is in fact very complex and opaque. It thus deserves greater clarity in order to better understand the deep layers of meaning to farmers in the historical political context of Myanmar.

Understanding the deeper significance and meaning that farmers attach to the words “land grab” entails frank discussions of formerly taboo subjects related to the country’s history of armed conflict, illicit drugs, cronyism and racism.

OBL:61332;Legal Review of Recently Enacted Farmland Law and Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Lands Management Law - Improving the Legal & Policy Frameworks Relating to Land Management in Myanmar;;"The Farmland Law and the VFV Law were approved by Parliament on March 30th, 2012. There have 
been a few improvements compared to previous laws such as recognition of
non-rotational taungya as 
a legitimate land-use and recognition that farmers are using VFV lands without formal recognition by 
the Government. However overall the Laws lack clarity and provide 
weak protection of the rights of 
smallholder farmers in upland areas and do not explicitly state the equal rights
of women to register 
and inherit land or be granted land-use rights for VFV land. The Laws
remain designed primarily to 
foster promotion of large-scale agricultural investment and fail to provide adequate safeguards for the 
majority of farmers who are smallholders. In particular tenure security for farmland remains weak due 
to the Government retaining power to rescind farm
land use rights leaving smallholders vulnerable to 
dispossession of their land-use rights. In addition there remains some unnecessary de-facto 
government control over the 
crop choices of farmers. 
In particular it is recommended 
that recognition of land-use rights under customary law and the 
creation of mechanisms for communal registration of land-use rights, 
be included in the Farmland and 
VFV Laws. There needs to be a comprehensive process of re-classifying land in the country to reflect 
land-use changes resulting from conversion of forests and VFV land into agricultural land, loss of 
agricultural land due to development projects, urban expansion and population growth. This will serve 
to reduce land conflict in the countryside and provide genuine tenure security for smallholders. 
Furthermore the specific and independent rights of
women must be explicitly stated in the Laws. 
Added to this the fundamental principle of free, 
prior and informed consent should be enshrined, 
especially in regard to 
removal of land-use rights 
in the national interest. 
It is also necessary that the Government works in partnership with civil society and farmers 
associations to revise the Farmland and VFV Laws...";"Robert B. Oberndorf

OBL:72519;A SOUND BASIS FOR LAND REFORM;;"The new National Land Use Policy is a positive step, but its principles need to be enshrined in law to protect the vulnerable from land grabs and forced evictions... 


Disputes over land ownership and use are a major source of social and economic tension in Myanmar as it grapples with political transition and economic development.

Irresponsible investment against the interests and wishes of communities which results in the widespread violation of land-related human rights has been allowed for too long.

The new National Land Use Policy (NLUP), released in the final days of the outgoing parliament in late January, is a welcome step towards improving the governance of land tenure.

The NLUP could not come sooner. An influx of investment has increased demand for land. Poor regulation and lax implementation mean that investors continue to be granted land obtained illegally or under dubious circumstances. Many communities have suddenly found themselves trespassing on land on which they have lived for generations. They are routinely charged with trespassing while their environment and livelihoods are degraded.

Experience from around the world has shown than human rights principles should frame land law advocacy. In a positive step, the NLUP uses rights-based language in its basic principles. It refers directly to human rights standards in chapters related to land acquisition, the land use rights of ethnic minorities and is framed with explicit reference to the equality of men and women.

On its own, though, the policy is not enough. Myanmar’s land laws do not adequately protect these rights. Laws enacted in 2012, such as the Foreign Investment Law, the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Law and the Farmland Law, were designed to increase investment, encourage large-scale land use and promote agricultural income. Under this system fewer than half the population have land title. The rest are vulnerable to land grabs and forced evictions, which result in further human rights abuses as people are dispossessed of their means of livelihood and habitat...";Daniel Aguirre;;Frontier Myanmar;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;19-02-2016;en;"land policies;land administration;land governance;land law";;Land Policy & Legislation;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72519;http://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/sound-basis-land-reform;;;;
OBL:100580;The Foreign Presence in Mandalay during the Konbaung Period: A Review of the Urban Area;;"Mandalay has many faces. As the last capital of the Konbaung Dynasty, Mandalay is
considered the origin of the traditional Myanmar culture. A wide variety of handicrafts
remain in practice today and are a focal point of the Buddhist practice. However, Mandalay
cannot be discussed in only the narrow framework of Myanmar culture. Mosques, Hindu
temples, and Chinese temples stood in a row along its streets, demonstrating the complex
history of this city.
However, the study of Mandalay’s diversity remains limited. The urban area of
Mandalay lies around a square castle, and the towns are ordered as a grid. Such an
extremely orderly city attracts attention from researchers, and arguments concentrate on
interpretation of the design, the centricity and the cosmology of the city. In addition, a
viewpoint assuming Mandalay as a model of the traditional capital of continental Southeast
Asia was dominant for a long time.
It is necessary to reconsider Mandalay as a hub in the regional trade network. Henry
Yule, who visited the city during the Konbaung period records prosperous local trade
activity. According to his account, various merchant groups including Chinese and Muslim
possessed commercial quarter. The presence of a variety of religious buildings and communities in contemporary Mandalay is difficult to understand without paying attention
to the commercial characteristics of the city. Recently, the study of the commercial importance of Mandalay has gradually
developed. For example, Thant Myint-U acknowledges the commercial importance of the
urban area. From the viewpoint of economic history, Schendel explains in detail a variety
of commercial activities of the merchant group based in Mandalay. However, still too few
studies address how these various groups were placed in the spatial structure of Mandalay.
This paper collects basic information and creates a rough sketch of the formation of
Mandalay.
I suggest in advance that foreigners assume a considerable part of the city’s functions
occur in the urban area. In the western part of the city, the commercial space stood along the
Shwe ta waterway. However, the military was concentrated in the eastern, northern, and
southern parts of the moat. In military duty, people of various backgrounds provided
services for the needs of the royal authority. However, the openness of the social structure
did not divide dwellers by ethnicity or religion in the city in those days, and personal
relationships with the sovereign were indispensable. Based on such characteristics, we
review Mandalay as an inland port city...";ISHIKAWA Kazumasa;;The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;27-12-2014;en;"land use planning;urban areas;land development (urbanization)";Urban Tenure;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/100580;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Ishikawa-2014-Foreign_Presence_in_Mandalay.pdf;;;;
OBL:100581;Transnational “Myanmar”-Karenni Societies in United States: Experiences of Karenni Refugee Resettlement;;"This paper examines the resettlement of refugees from Burma/Myanmar to the United
States, by focusing on the refugee experience. The ethnographic description of the
resettlement process reveals how refugees, by establishing a transnational “Myanmar”
community in the United States, manifested a nationalism that was hitherto believed to be
impossible.
Building a nation-state in Burma/Myanmar has been a controversial issue since the
nation’s independence from the British in 1948. Callahan argues that the process of state
building in Burma has focused on warfare and violence by the state. After independence,
the national army or Tatmadaw regarded citizens as potential enemies, and conducted
various anti-insurgency campaigns. Her argument richly elucidates the state-building
process in Burma/Myanmar. However, though the Nation and the State are inseparable, her
arguments exclude the nation-building process. This paper explores one aspect of
belonging to the nation of “Myanmar.”
While state building is one of the most important tasks for a country following ethnic
conflict, it is often analyzed only within the context of resistance movements, such as
“Burmanization” by the government or resistance movements against it. Hence, the possibilities for actual nation building have not yet been explored. The experiences of
refugees outside the country offer a new and useful perspective for such a discussion.
Refugees may no longer legally belong to their country of origin, yet their existence
expresses the core essence of the nation they come from.
The case study dealt with in this paper focuses on Karenni refugees from the Kayah
State, which is the smallest state in Burma. In the Kayah State, the Karenni National
Progressive Party (KNPP) has been resisting the Burmese ruling military junta for more
than 60 years, seeking either autonomy or independence from the state. The KNPP
strategically have used the word “Karenni” as an umbrella term that includes all ethnic
groups in Kayah State, in order to resist the Burma-centric state. The ex-chairman of the
KNPP, namely Khu Hte Bu Pe, invented a “Karenni” script for the sake of the core spirit of
his nation. Two refugee camps in Thailand were centers of KNPP politics in order to
construct the “Karenni”, and “Karenni” has been an anti-state term, with its use being
prohibited inside Burma by the junta. The category of “Karenni” or “Karenni” identity was
constructed as a refugee concept in Thailand. This paper discusses the further transnational
spread of “Karenni” through the resettlement of refugees to a third country, while also
considering the meaning of Burma and Myanmar for those resettled refugees...";KUBO Tadayuki;;The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;27-12-2014;en;displacement;Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/100581;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Kubo-2014-Karenni_Refugee_Resettlement.pdf;;;;
OBL:43495;Migrant Domestic Workers: From Burma to Thailand (short version);;"Abstract:
Millions of people from Burma have migrated into neighboring countries over the past decade.
Most have left their country in search of security and safety as a direct result of internal conflict
and militarization, severe economic hardship and minority persecution. This exodus represents
one of the largest migration flows in Southeast Asia.
Fearing persecution, the vast majority of those migrating from Burma find themselves desperate
to survive, obtaining work in underground and, often, illegal labor markets. The majority of those
fleeing Burma migrate to neighboring Thailand, where an estimated two million people from
Burma work in “3-D jobs” (dangerous, dirty and difficult). Although there is a growing
awareness of their isolation and vulnerability to labor exploitation and violence, there is little
data available documenting their realities. This results in the alienation of domestic workers and
perpetuates the disregard for their labor and basic rights.
This paper presents the findings of research proposed and implemented by members of the Shan
Women’s Action Network and the Karen Women’s Organization regarding girls and women who
have migrated from Burma into domestic work in Thailand. This paper focuses on the roots
causes of migration from Burma to Thailand, the harsh conditions in which foreign domestic
workers are employed and their inability to defend their most basic rights while they are in
Thailand, and lastly on their future aspirations.
Foreign domestic workers interviewed in this study described that the major cause of migration
were related to political and economic situations in Burma. The push-pull theory explains this
migration stream. In Thailand, the migrant domestic workers being expected to work on
demand, without agreed upon responsibilities or a written contract delineating working hours,
days off, accommodations, salaries, sick leave, care or pay. However, they had their dreams and
hopes of securing a better future for their families and themselves. In the recommendations,
roles of both Burma and Thai governments, NGOs and CBOs in helping establish appropriate
interventions to reduce the abuse, exploitation and trafficking of migrant domestic workers are
stated. The importance of recognizing domestic work as labor as well as the need to provide
protection for the domestic workers under national labor laws is emphasised in this study...";"Sureeporn Punpuing

OBL:57782;Landmine chapter of the Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2004;;"...The immense violence that has been inflicted upon civilians throughout the world from anti-personnel landmines has led to the growing international acceptance of the necessity of their eradication. On 5 December 1997, in response to this realization, 122 countries came together and signed the Mine Ban Treaty (also known as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction). In opposition to the worldwide trend however, Burma has to date not acceded to nor signed the treaty and continues to be not only a regular user of landmines, but also a producer. Since the Mine Ban Treaty’s inception in 1997, Burma has abstained from voting on every resolution of the UN General Assembly which supports it and continues to state that the problem of insurgency prevents them from signing the treaty.

 

Anti-personnel landmines are victim-activated weapons that indiscriminately kill and maim civilians, soldiers, elderly people, women, children and animals. These devices can remain functioning long after military personnel have departed and even after the cessation of hostilities. As a result of their autonomous nature, landmines often inflict injury in situations that might otherwise appear peaceful. Civilians often perceive environments to be safe after the cessation of open conflict and attempt to resume their means of livelihood. Accordingly, one study suggests that a third of Burma’s landmine casualties are civilians. 

 

Despite the numerous ceasefires that have been signed between the Burmese government and various insurgent groups, landmine casualties in the country still appear to be rising. Burma currently suffers amongst the highest numbers of landmine victims each year of any country. Despite the growing carnage resulting from the use of landmines, Burma remains, along with Russia, the only other country to have been deploying them on a regular basis since 1999...";;;Human Rights Documentation Unit (National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-06-2005;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/57782;http://burmalibrary.org/docs3/Burma%20Yearbook%202004/HTML%20Peages/Landmines%20in%20Burma.htm;;;;
OBL:57783;Landmine chapter of the Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2005;;The deployment of anti-personnel landmines increased by the SPDC and its forces Burma during 2005. This increase has transpired despite widespread international condemnation over the use of landmines due to the extensive indiscriminate humanitarian consequences of the devices. As a result of growing international consensus against the manufacture, deployment and trade of landmines, government and non-governmental bodies drafted the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (a.k.a., the Mine Ban Treaty) in 1997. This treaty to date has been signed by 122 countries. Burma, however, has refused to sign the treaty. More recently, the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of Resolution 59/84, which called for universally accepting the Mine Ban Treaty, in December 2004. Burma was one of 22 countries that abstained from the voting process. In addition, Burma failed to send an observer to the First Review Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty that took place in Nairobi, Kenya in November-December 2004 (source: Landmine Monitor Report 2005: Toward a Mine-Free World, ICBL, 23 November 2005).

OBL:57781;Landmine chapter of the Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2003-2004;;"...The atrocities related to landmines in Burma are not limited to the injury and death of non-military personnel but also include their use to violate Article 13 of the UN Declaration of Human rights, that of an individual’s freedom of movement both internally and internationally. In order to restrict the movement of supplies and information to insurgent groups, well-established routes to and from villages have been mined. Villages themselves have also been mined in attempts to prevent the return of both forcibly relocated communities as well as, in some areas, refugees.

Though totals are not known, the number of casualties related to landmines appears to be increasing. This has been especially noticeable over the last five to six years. The growth of landmine related casualties is at least partially the result of the cumulative effect of continued deployment over the years.

According to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), only three countries; namely: Burma, Nepal and Russia, continued to use landmines during 2006; with the most extensive use reported to have occurred in Burma. [1] Meanwhile, there is a growing international consensus on the need to ban the use of landmines across the globe. This consensus is reflected both in the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, commonly known as the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT), and in various recent United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions that call for the universalization of this treaty. [2] The MBT has now been ratified by three-quarters of the world's nations. This growing consensus reflects a common recognition of the destructive and indiscriminate effects of anti-personnel landmines. Landmines can remain functional years after hostilities have ceased, and often inflict injury in situations that might otherwise appear peaceful.

OBL:57785;Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2007: Landmines;;Antipersonnel landmines continued to be deployed in significant numbers in Burma during 2007, despite a growing international consensus that the use of landmines is unacceptable and that their use should be unconditionally ceased. As of mid-August 2007, 155 countries, or 80 percent of the world’s nations were State Parties to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (also known as and henceforth referred to as the ‘Mine Ban Treaty’), leaving only 40 countries outside the treaty. [1] Such widespread support of the Mine Ban Treaty recognises that landmines often kill indiscriminately, and in doing so, pose an unacceptable level of risk to civilian and non-combatant populations. According to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), the “Mine Ban Treaty has made the new use of antipersonnel mines, especially by governments, a rare phenomenon”. However, the ICBL concedes that Burma is one of only two countries (along with Russia) which represents the exception to the “near-universal stigmatization of the use of antipersonnel mines”, and that the most extensive deployment of antipersonnel landmines by “government forces” during 2007 occurred in Burma.

OBL:64010;Grab for white gold - platinum mining in Eastern Shan State (Lahu);;"Summary:
Since 2007, destructive platinum mining has been taking place in the hills north of
Tachilek, eastern Shan State, impacting about 2,000 people from eight Lahu, Akha
and Shan villages. The platinum is being extracted by Burmese mining companies and
exported to China and Thailand.
Five companies are currently operating around the Akha village of Ah Yeh, 13 kilometers
north of Tachilek. They have forced villagers to sell property and land at cheap prices,
and confiscated other lands without compensation. Hundreds of acres of farms and
forestland have been seized, or destroyed by dumping of mining waste. The villagers’
access road to the main highway has been ruined by the passage of heavy mining trucks
and machinery.
The main water source for local villagers has been diverted and contaminated by
the mining, causing tremendous hardship for local women, who must now walk long
distances to do their washing.
Women are also facing increased security risks from the influx of migrant male miners
into the area. There is regular sexual harassment of women going to their fields. Young
women are being taken as minor wives by the miners; some are also becoming sex
workers. Mining staff have also been involved in trafficking of local women.
There is no rule of law protecting the rights of the local villagers. By paying off the local
Burmese military, mining companies are able to carry out operations without adhering
to any social or environmental standards. The companies and platinum buyers in
neighbouring countries are therefore maximizing profits by avoiding responsibility for
the social and environmental costs of the mines.
The Lahu Women’s Organisation therefore calls on the Burmese government to put an
immediate stop to these destructive mining operations, which are not contributing to
local development, but are causing poverty and environmental degradation.";;;Lahu Women's Organization;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;08-05-2012;en;"mining;land grabbing;land use;extractive industries;security of tenure (land)";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64010;https://democracyforburma.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/lahu-women-report-grab-for-white-gold-impacts-of-platinum-mining-in-eastern-shan-state-burmese-english/;;;;

OBL:42298;SURVIVING IN SHADOW: Widespread Militarization and the Systematic Use of Forced Labour in the Campaign for Control of Thaton District;;" This report examines the situation faced by Karen villagers in Thaton District (known as Doo Tha Htoo in Karen). The district lies in what is officially the northern part of Mon State and also encompasses part of Karen State to the west of the Salween River . Successive Burmese regimes have had strong control over the parts of the district to the west of the Rangoon-Martaban road for many years. They were also able to gain 'defacto' control over the eastern part of the district following the fall of the former Karen National Union (KNU) stronghold at Manerplaw in 1995. The Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) is also strong in the district, particularly in the eastern stretches of Pa'an township. Although diminished in recent years, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), the armed wing of the KNU, is still quite active in the district. The villagers in the district have had to contend with all three of these armed groups. The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) and DKBA demand forced labour, taxes, and extortion money from the villagers while also severely restricting their movements. While the demands for some forms of forced labour such as portering have declined over the past few years, the villagers continue to be regularly called upon by both the SPDC and the DKBA to expand the ever-increasing network of roads throughout the district, as well to fulfil the frequent orders to supply staggering quantities of building materials. A number of new SPDC and DKBA controlled commercial ventures have also appeared in the district in recent years, to which the villagers are also forced to 'contribute' their labour. In 2000, the SPDC confiscated 5,000 acres of land for use as an immense sugarcane plantation, while more recently in late 2004, the SPDC again confiscated another 5,000 acres of the villagers' farmland, all of which is to become a huge rubber plantation, co-owed and operated by Rangoon-based company Max Myanmar. In addition, the villagers are punished for any perceived support for the KNLA or KNU. All such systems of control greatly impoverish the villagers, to the extent that now many of them struggle just to survive.

Most villagers have few options but to try to live as best they can. SPDC control of the district is too tight for the villagers to live in hiding in the forest and Thailand is too far for most villagers to flee to. The villagers are forced to answer the demands of the SPDC and DKBA, of which there are many, while trying to avoid punishment for any supposed support of the resistance. They have to balance this with trying to find enough time to work in their fields and find enough food to feed their families.

This report provides a detailed analysis of the human rights situation in Thaton District from 2000 to the present. It is based on 216 interviews conducted by KHRG researchers with people in SPDC-controlled villages, in hill villages, in hiding in the forest and with those who have fled to Thailand to become refugees. These interviews are supplemented by SPDC and DKBA order documents selected from the hundreds we have obtained from the area, along with field reports, maps, and photographs taken by KHRG field researchers. All of the interviews were conducted between November 1999 and November 2004. A number of field reports dated up until June 2005 have also been included.

The report begins with an Introduction and Executive Summary. The detailed analysis that follows has been broken down into ten main sections. The villagers tell most of the story in the main sections through direct quotes taken from recorded interviews. The full text of the interviews and the field reports upon which this report is based are available from KHRG upon approved request.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;17-01-2006;en;"agricultural land management;land governance;food security;farmers";Land & Food Security;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/42298;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2006/khrg0601a.htm;;;;

OBL:42764;Internal Displacement and Protection in Eastern Burma;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
""The Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) first collaborated with communitybased
organizations to document the scale and distribution of internal displacement
in Eastern Burma during 2002. Two years later, another survey was coordinated to
enhance understanding about the vulnerability of internally displaced persons. These
assessments sought to increase awareness about the situation in conflict-affected
areas which remain largely inaccessible to the international community.
More communities have been displaced during the past year while others have
attempted to return to former villages, resettle elsewhere in Burma or continue their
journey of forced migration into Thailand. As the environment is constantly evolving,
situation assessments also need to be regularly revised. Part of the purpose of this
report is thus to update estimates of the scale and distribution of internally displaced
persons in eastern Burma.
Threats against conflict-affected populations in eastern Burma have been well
documented by a range of independent institutions. However, there is little information
on humanitarian efforts to stop existing patterns of abuse, mitigate the worst
consequences, prevent emerging threats and promote judicial redress. A second key
objective is therefore to inform the development of humanitarian protection strategies
for internally displaced persons and other civilians whose lives and livelihoods are
threatened by war, abuse and violence.
This year's surveys were designed in partnership with ethnic community based
organizations with reference to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and
conducted between April and June 2005. Estimates for the scale and distribution of
internal displacement have been compiled from interviews with key informants in
37 townships across the six states and divisions of eastern Burma. Analysis of
issues relevant to humanitarian protection has been based around responses to 1,044
questionnaires with conflict-affected households spread evenly between hiding sites,
government controlled relocation sites, ethnic administered ceasefire areas and
mixed administration areas. These responses have been complemented by semistructured
interviews with internally displaced persons, the four main non state actors
in eastern Burma and ten humanitarian agencies based in Rangoon.
During the past year it is estimated that a further 87,000 people were forced or obliged
to leave their homes by the effects of war or human rights abuses. Border-wide, a
further 68 villages were destroyed, relocated or otherwise abandoned during this
period, including a number which had only recently been established by displaced
persons. In the majority of cases, forced displacement was found to be caused by
violence or abuse perpetrated by the armed forces of the ruling State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC). This survey has also identified 88 previously
abandoned villages which have been partially re-established during the past year. In
this time, it is estimated that 40,000 people who had previously been displaced have
returned to their homes or resettled elsewhere in eastern Burma.
The total number of internally displaced persons in eastern Burma who have been
forced or obliged to leave their homes over the past decade and have not been able
to return or resettle and reintegrate into society is estimated to be at least 540,000
people. The population is comprised of 340,000 people currently in the temporary
settlements of ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities, while 92,000
civilians are estimated to be hiding from the Burma Army in areas most affected by armed conflict and approximately 108,000 villagers have followed eviction orders
from the SPDC and moved into designated relocation sites.
Overall this represents a slight increase of approximately 14,000 internally displaced
persons since late 2004. This is attributed primarily to flight in Shan State away
from SPDC patrols and into hiding, a significant inflow into Mon ceasefire areas,
and methodological differences estimating populations in Tenasserim Division's
relocation sites. These combined increases have outweighed reductions in the
estimates for internally displaced populations hiding in Karen State as well as for
ceasefire areas in Shan and Karen State. However, these population estimates are
considered conservative as it has not been possible to include displaced persons in
urban areas and rural mixed administration areas who may not have reintegrated into
society but rather remain in a state of internal displacement.
Patterns of insecurity, the coping strategies of survivors of abuse and violence, and
attempts at engaging the humanitarian responsibility of relevant authorities
were assessed to inform the development of protection strategies. The survey
conclusively found that not only are soldiers from the Burma Army the primary
perpetrators of abuse, but also that the Government of Burma is generally unable or
unwilling to strengthen local coping strategies and protect civilians from harm.
Legal insecurity is highlighted by findings that less than a quarter of the conflictaffected
population own legal title deeds for land tenure while just 12% of civilians
hiding from Burma Army patrols possess an identity card. The former reflects
the threat of land confiscation while the latter increases vulnerability to extortion at
checkpoints, harassment in contested areas, restricted access to markets and fields
as well as another obstacle for the internally displaced against returning to former
homes or resettlement elsewhere in Burma.
Despite the range and severity of deliberate physical violence in conflict-affected
areas, the prevalence of threats to civilian livelihoods is on a much greater scale. A
third of households surveyed have been directly affected by arbitrary taxes and
forced labour in the past year. During this period, the deliberate impoverishment
and deprivation of civilians as a counter-insurgency strategy is reflected in 17% of
households having had food supplies destroyed or confiscated. Similarly, a quarter
of households in hiding and relocation sites reported having had housing destroyed
or having been forcibly evicted during the past year.
Although unable to stop or prevent violence and abuse, internally displaced and
conflict-affected villagers have developed a range of coping strategies to resist threats
and mitigate the worst consequences. Other civilians are the main source of early
warning signals about approaching troops, which stresses the importance of building
social capital, or networks of trust, within and between local communities for the
development of a more protective environment.
Hiding food supplies and preparing alternative hiding sites in case counterinsurgency
patrols induce an emergency evacuation were the main approaches to
coping with threats amongst households in hiding sites. Conversely, the main method
of minimizing risks in relocation sites and mixed administration areas is reportedly to
pay fines and follow orders. These findings suggest that abuses against civilians by
government forces are motivated not only by retaliation against armed opposition
patrols, but also by economic imperatives or greed. Six percent of households reported that they had at some point resorted to procuring
a hand gun to minimize threats to safety and livelihoods. Given the threat of being
suspected as either a rebel sympathizer by the SPDC or a government collaborator
by the armed opposition, this gauge of the prevalence of assault weapons is
considered high. Due to the breakdown in law and order and the ease of
procurement, transport, concealment and use, the prevalence of small arms is in
itself a significant threat of violent insecurity.
Humanitarian responsibilities relate to ensuring that parties to a conflict respect
human dignity and prevent harm from being inflicted on civilians. While it was
beyond the possibility of this survey to engage Burmese national authorities, the views
of non state actors were solicited. Humanitarian agencies based in Rangoon were
also consulted about their experiences in dealing with the government.
Non state actors acknowledged that the use of landmines was their main transgression
in terms of threatening the safety and livelihoods of civilians. 86% of villagers surveyed
were not aware of any signs on location warning about minefields, indicating that
there is no systematic demarcation of minefields in eastern Burma. However the
armed opposition authorities, and indeed a quarter of civilian households hiding
in the most conflict-affected areas, perceived landmines as a necessary means of
self-defense against the military might of the Burma Army.
It was also admitted by non state actors that their protective capacities are limited.
Authorities from ceasefire parties negotiated a cessation of hostilities ten years ago
to reduce the deprivations suffered by the civilian population, but have still not been
able to address ongoing human rights abuses. In areas of ongoing armed conflict,
the non state actors responded that short term protection objectives are limited to
deterring and delaying SPDC patrols, using radio communication to provide warnings
to villagers of approaching troop movements, and securing access for local
humanitarian agencies to provide relief aid.
Humanitarian agencies based in Rangoon have managed to expand not only their
access into eastern Burma but also the engagement of government authorities
in policy-level dialogue during the past decade. However, United Nations (UN)
agencies reported that since the purge of the former Prime Minister and his allies
in October 2004, humanitarian agencies in Burma have either been disregarded or
viewed with suspicion by the government. Unless the government is willing to
engage in policy-level dialogue about protection concerns, it is recognised that the
humanitarian space will contract further.
At the same time humanitarian agencies increasingly feel squeezed by restrictions
from donors who are worried that foreign aid may be prolonging the rule of an
illegitimate government. A perceived concern is that humanitarian sanctions will
further restrict contact with policy makers, and exacerbate the reluctance of the
Burmese government to negotiate about protection concerns. The challenge for
humanitarian responses is to promote protection oriented programming which
includes assessment of the programme's impact on the conflict.
These surveys sought to update estimates of internal displacement and inform the
development of protection strategies for conflict-affected areas in eastern Burma.
Recommendations are not presented, but it is hoped that this report will enlighten
collaborative strategies to stop existing patterns of abuse and prevent emerging threats
from harming internally displaced and other conflict-affected communities.";;;The Border Consortium;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2005;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/42764;http://burmalibrary.org/docs3/TBBC-Internal_Displacement_and_Protection_in_Eastern_Burma-2005.pdf;;;;

OBL:62687;Seized: The 2008 landgrab for food and financial security;;Today’s food and financial crises have, in tandem, triggered a new global land grab. On the one hand, “food insecure” governments that rely on imports to feed their people are snatching up vast areas of farmland abroad for their own offshore food production. On the other hand, food corporations and private investors, hungry for profits in the midst of the deepening financial crisis, see investment in foreign farmland as an important new source of revenue. As a result, fertile agricultural land is becoming increasingly privatised and concentrated. If left unchecked, this global land grab could spell the end of small-scale farming, and rural livelihoods, in numerous places around the world. Land grabbing has been going on for centuries. One has only to think of Columbus “discovering” America and the brutal expulsion of indigenous communities that this unleashed, or white colonialists taking over territories occupied by the Maori in New Zealand and by the Zulu in South Africa. It is a violent process very much alive today, from China to Peru. Hardly a day goes by without reports in the press about struggles over land, as mining companies such as Barrick Gold invade the highlands of South America or food corporations such as Dole or San Miguel swindle farmers out of their land entitlements in the Philippines. In many countries, private investors are buying up huge areas to be run as natural parks or conservation areas. And wherever you look, the new biofuels industry, promoted as an answer to climate change, seems to rely on throwing people off their land...;;;GRAIN;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;24-10-2008;en;"land governance;land grabbing;land tenure;forestry;land rights;land tenure systems";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62687;http://www.grain.org/article/entries/93-seized-the-2008-landgrab-for-food-and-financial-security;;;;

OBL:62684;Land not for sale! Letter of global solidarity against land grabs in Burma/Myanmar;;"The current reforms in Burma/Myanmar are worsening land grabs in the country. Since the mid-2000s there has been a spike in land grabs, especially leading up to the 2010 national elections. Military and government authorities have been granting large-scale land concessions to well-connected Burmese companies.

Farmers’ protests against land grabs have drawn recent public attention to many high profile cases, such as Yuzana’s Hukawng Valley cassava concession, the Dawei SEZ in Tanintharyi Region near the Thai border, Zaygaba’s industrial development zone outside Yangon, and the current Monywa copper mine expansion in Sagaing Division, among many others. By 2011, over 200 Burmese companies had officially been allocated approximately 2 million acres (nearly 810,000 hectares) for privately held agricultural concessions, mainly for agro-industrial crops such as rubber, palm oil, jatropha (physic nut), cassava and sugarcane.

Land grabs are now set to accelerate due to new government laws that are specifically designed to encourage foreign investments in land. The two new land laws (the Farmlands Law and the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Law) establish a legal framework to reallocate so-called ‘wastelands’ to domestic and foreign private investors. Moreover, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Law and Foreign Investment Law that are being finalized, along with ASEAN-ADB regional infrastructure development plans, will provide new incentives and drivers for land grabbing and further compound the dispossession of local communities from their lands and resources. Land conflicts that are now emerging throughout the country will worsen as foreign companies, supported by foreign governments and International Financial Institutions (IFIs), rush in to profit from Burma/Myanmar’s political and economic transition period...";;;"GRAIN;farmlandgrab.org";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;09-10-2012;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing;security of tenure (land)";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62684;http://farmlandgrab.org/post/view/21128;;;;

It also includes demands for forced labour by Tatmadaw LIBs #358, #547 and #548, in which villagers were required to harvest paddy on government land; this information concerning forced labour is also described in a news bulletin published by KHRG on June 22nd 2012, ""Forced labour and extortion in Pa'an District."" This report also includes information about the removal of 30 landmines by the Border Guard, before a landmine injury to one soldier halted the removal operations. In order to deal with problems related to insufficient landmine removal, villagers have taken precautions to limit their activities to areas unlikely to be mined. Due to limited opportunities for villagers to earn their livelihoods, some have begun to commercially produce charcoal and alcohol, or breed their livestock for consumption.

OBL:57922;Energy Security: Security for Whom?;;"In military-ruled Burma, also known as Myanmar, large-scale natural gas
projects have directly and indirectly led to violations of basic human rights
through the complicity of multinational corporate actors. These abuses are
ongoing and there is an unreasonably high risk they will increase as more gas
projects are developed. This paper assesses the past, present, and future human
rights impacts of large-scale natural gas extraction in Burma, and the
implications these impacts have in terms of corporate accountability. The
paper provides background information regarding Burma’s government,
economic policy, and the energy sector and considers past and present human
rights abuses connected to the Yadana natural gas project, developed by a
consortium including Chevron, Total, PTTEP, and MOGE. The authors
argue that the companies are complicit in ongoing human rights abuses in
connection to their investment. The paper then describes the threat of future
human rights abuses in connection to the country’s largest offshore gas
deposits, concluding that there is a high risk that current human rights abuses in the proposed project areas will be exacerbated by the new gas production,
and that there will likely be abuses directly linked to the Shwe pipeline project.
Finally, the authors assess the interests and actors involved in the Southeast
Asia regional energy security dynamic as it relates to Burma’s fast growing
oil and gas sector, human rights, and corporate accountability. They argue
that the energy security strategies of China, Thailand, and India—and by
association, the national oil corporations under those governments—relying
on Burmese resources have paid dangerously inadequate attention to the
protection of human rights.";"Matthew F. Smith

In 2014, Myanmar(Burma)confounded industry analysts by emerging to become the World's third biggest tin producer, experiencing a 5-year tin production increase of ca.4900%. This surprise emergence of Myanmar as a major tin producer is a possible Black Swan event that potentially has significant re-percussions both for the future of global tin production, and for the economic development of Myanmar. This is a disruptive event that has likely contributed to a substantial drop in tin prices in 2015. The
Myanmar production increase came from a new minesite in Wa State, and not from the traditional tin-producing areas in the South. We discuss tin mining and potential in Myanmar and consider whether it could provide a foundation for the economic rehabilitation of the country...";"Nicholas J. Gardiner

OBL:72074;A Study of the Role of Forest and Forest-Dependent Community in Myanmar;;... This study was intended to find out the benefits of forests, especially for non-wood forest products (NWFPs), to forestdependent local people and the relation to their socio-economic status. Sampling (169 respondents) was chosen to be an equal distribution of household’s economic status.

OBL:72071;Land and Law in Myanmar: A Practitioners Perspective Workshop - Report and Recommendations (English/ Burmese ??????????);;"KEY RECOMMENDATIONS:-
(1) TO MYANMAR LAWYERS:
""a. Lawyers need to form strong networks and associations to support farmers, ethnic groups and community organizations...
b. Lawyers need to develop new skills to participate in policy advocacy, including collecting data about current practices, and engage in a national debate about land rights...
c. Lawyers working on land rights cases need to use all available tools to strengthen their case work (see annex 2 for a list of practical actions lawyers can take).....
(2) TO CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS:
a. CSO’s need to work with lawyers to understand the law regarding land ownership and use, how it is being applied and how it can be used to protect land rights and should share this knowledge with communities...
b. CSOs should be involved in collecting evidence of the current relationships between communities and land; this will be essential for developing good policies and new laws.....
(3) TO INTERNATIONAL DONORS:
a. Donors must look beyond the letter of the law and information produced by the government to explore how laws are currently being applied and how the legal system operates in practice. Many challenges faced by lawyers working on land rights cases would not require legal reform to correct; international donors should demand immediate changes to remove some of the existing barriers to justice...
b. International donors must translate information relating to land rights into Burmese as a minimum. Understanding of these issues and ongoing reform processes within Myanmar is currently very limited, with residents of Yangon and other cities able to access information far easier than people in rural areas; efforts need to be made to address geographic and ethnic differences in understanding.";;;"Myanmar Lawyers Network; Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC)";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;16-07-2015;"en;my";"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;land administration;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72071;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/MLC%26AHRC-2015-07-Land_and_Law_Report-en.pdf;;;;
OBL:72070;Deforestation in the Ayeyarwady Delta and the Conservation Implications of an Internationally Engaged Myanmar;;"... Myanmar is a country of huge biodiversity importance that is undergoing major political change, bringing with it new international engagement. This includes access to international markets, which will likely spur investment in export-oriented agriculture, leading to increased pressures on already threatened ecosystems. This scenario is illustrated in the Ayeyarwady Delta, the country’s agricultural heartland sustaining high deforestation rates. Using the Delta as a model system, we use an integrated
approach to inquire about whether and how imminent agricultural reforms associated with an internationally-engaged Myanmar could introduce new actors and incentives to invest in agricultural expansion that could affect deforestation rates. We use a novel remote sensing analysis to quantify deforestation rates for the Delta from 1978 to 2011, develop business-as-usual deforestation scenarios,
and contextualize those results with an analysis of contemporary policy changes within Myanmar that are expected to alter the principal drivers of land-cover change. We show that mangrove systems of Myanmar are under greater threat than previously recognized, and that agriculture has been the principle driver of deforestation on the Delta. The centrality of agriculture to the Myanmar economy indicates that emerging policies are likely to tip the scales towards agricultural expansion, agro-industrial investment and potentially greater rates of deforestation due to the introduction of well-funded investors, insufficient land tenure agreements, and low governance effectiveness. The broad national challenge is to initiate environmental governance reforms (including safeguards) in the face of significant pressures for land grabbing and opportunistic resource extraction...";Kevin Woods;;The Journal of Peasant Studies;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;14-09-2011;en;"deforestation;forest land;research;forest management plans";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72070;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/Webb_-_Deforestation_Ayearwaddy.pdf;;;;
OBL:72072;Ceasefire Capitalism: Military-Private Partnerships, Resource Concessions and Military-State Building in the Burma-China Borderlands;;"... Since ceasefire agreements were signed between the Burmese military government and ethnic political groups in the Burma–China borderlands in the early 1990s, violent waves of counterinsurgency development have replaced warfare to target politically-suspect, resource-rich, ethnic populated borderlands. The Burmese regime allocates land concessions in ceasefire zones as an explicit postwar military strategy to govern land and populations to produce regulated, legible, militarized territory. Tracing the relationship of military–state formation, land control
and securitization, and primitive accumulation in the Burma–China borderlands uncovers the forces of what I am calling ‘ceasefire capitalism’. This study examines these processes of Burmese military–state building over the past decade in resource-rich ethnic ceasefire zones along the Yunnan, China border. I will illustrate this contemporary and violent military–state formation process with two
case studies focusing on northern Burma: logging and redirected timber trade flows, and Chinese rubber plantations as part of China’s opium substitution

OBL:72189;Breaking the Curse - Decentralizing Natural Resource Management in Myanmar (Burmese ??????????);;"Summary: ""In 2008, Myanmar’s military rulers ratified a new constitution that ensured their continued monopoly of the country’s natural resources. Section 37 (a) states:
“the Union is the ultimate owner ofall lands and all natural resources above and below the ground, above and beneath the water and in the atmosphere”
Under this constitution, the central government in Naypyidaw is not only the owner of all natural resources in the country; it also controls and manages them, enacting “necessary laws for extraction.” This centralized control has had disastrous effects in widening inequality, fueling a cycle of conflict and violence, and depleting non-renewable resources that could be the basis of a sound economy for future generations.
Arakan State provides a perfect illustration of this and lies at the heart of one of Myanmar’s most sought after resources: natural gas. The Shwe project now produces 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, yet none of this is used to provide electricity in Arakan State. While local communities bear livelihood and environmental destruction, human rights abuses and land confiscation, the gas is sold to China and more than one billion USD annually flows to Naypyidaw. There, accounting of the revenues remains opaque and reinvestment in Arakan’s infrastructure, education, and health is practically non-existent. The state is the second poorest in the country
Until now, the military, the central government, and foreign investors have taken advantage of the centralized governance structure and a lack of protection mechanisms to make all the decisions around natural resources and reap most of the benefits. In contrast, devolving the powers to manage resources to lower levels of government will establish political, administrative, and fiscal structures so that decisions around the use of natural resources can be made at local levels with input from affected peoples. This distribution of powers makes natural resource management more accountable to the needs of local communities and will therefore ensure a more sustainable development.
Drawing on the Arakan Oil Watch’s decade-long work with communities affected by natural resource investments and experiences from resource-rich countries around the world, we find six critical components to achieve sustainable natural resource management in Myanmar. They are:
1. Build peace: A moratorium on high-value natural resource extraction until political agreements and new legislation have been finalized will reduce tensions and conflict and allow time for protection laws and institutions to be established. Peace
4
agreements that specify division of powers—such as the one in Papua New Guinea—will help prevent conflicts from re- emerging and enable subnational governments to proceed with establishing their own governance structures.
2. Broaden participation: Engaging people in the process of managing their own resources and ensuring that they receive benefits from their resources will prevent resentment and reduce conflicts. Strengthening formal participation, as is done in Latin America with community referendums, will provide immediate input from affected communities and community- based organizations on natural resource projects as well as on long-term planning decisions.
3. Decentralize governance: Transferring significant powers of authority from Naypyidaw to civilian-led state and regional governments through statutory and constitutional provisions will bring decision-making closer to affected people and make development processes more efficient and equitable.
4. Decentralize ownership of natural resources: Amending Section 37 (a) of the national constitution to enable states and regions to own their natural resources will address longstanding calls for more autonomy from ethnic organizations, contributing to long lasting peace.
5. Decentralize control and management of natural resources: Amending Section 37 (b) of the national constitution so that states and regions can control and manage their lands and natural resources, including the decision whether or not non-renewable resources should be extracted. State and regional governments will also then be able to establish appropriate laws and institutions for economic planning, regulation and monitoring of extractive industries, and rights protection for current and future generations.
6. Decentralize collection of natural resource revenues:
Providing legislative powers for states and regions to collect significant taxes will enable responsive local governments to manage their own budgets and allocate funds according to local plans and needs, reducing time consuming and costly bureaucracy at the national level, and better serving local populations."".....This Burmese version has been drastically reduced using OCR software, resulting in some blurred text and some pages split in half.

OBL:77802;"BURMA: Land grabbing not ""in accordance with law""";;"Over the course of 2013 the Asian Human Rights Commission has followed reports of a larger number of conflicts over land grabs and attempted grabs in Burma, or Myanmar. Some of the conflicts are over recently taken land, and others are reinitiating struggles begun many years ago. These land grabs include the well-known expansion of the Letpadaung Hills copper mine in Salingyi Township, Sagaing Region, under a joint project of the armed forces' holding company and a Chinese partner; the conflict between farmers and police in Ma-Ubin, in the delta, over the taking of land by a private firm with backing of local officials; and, a land grab by the police force itself in Nattalin Township, Bago Region.

Most recently, news reports and online sites have detailed how villagers in Migyaunggan, Mandalay Region, have begun protesting to reclaim land taken from them by an army detachment. The local administration and cantonment board have issued warnings to protestors to desist with their actions. Meantime, senior officials have come to investigate the complaints about the land and learned that the army has no documentation to show that it is entitled to occupy the contested area.

Under noxious laws passed in 2010, prior to the transfer of power to the current semi-elected government in Burma, the army retains authority to designate and use land for a variety of purposes. In the case of the Cantonment Municipalities Law, No. 32/2010, the armed forces can establish bodies for the management of land designated as being part of cantonment towns.

OBL:72323;COMMUNITY LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCE TENURE RECOGNITION: REVIEW OF COUNTRY EXPERIENCES;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ""In recent years, many governments globally
have formally recognized community land and
natural resource tenure, either based on existing
customary practices or more recently established
land governance arrangements.1 These tenure
arrangements have been called by a variety of
names, such as community, customary, communal,
collective, indigenous, ancestral, or native land rights
recognition. In essence, they seek to establish the
rights of a group to obtain joint tenure security
over their community’s land. This approach is not
necessarily limited to use by those communities that
largely manage their lands solely on a communal
or collective basis, because it can encompass
individualized arrangements within it. In fact,
recognizing the boundary of all lands held by a
community, and then allowing the community itself
to define individual rights within that community
land boundary, can be much more cost-effective
(Deininger, 2003). Neither is it an approach
solely used by indigenous, ancestral, or native communities, because any rural community with
established occupation of their lands can potentially
be eligible for such protections. We use the term
“community land and resource tenure” because
many community-based forms of tenure encompass
a range of different land use types, including
permanent agricultural land, shifting or swidden
cultivation areas, forests, grazing areas, and water
bodies.
The Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance
of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests in the Context
of National Food Security, established in 2012, affirm
the importance of recognizing and respecting all
legitimate tenure rights holders and their rights,
whether formally recorded or not (Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
[FAO], 2012). This includes indigenous peoples
(IP) and other communities with customary tenure
systems that exercise self-governance of land,

Abstract:
""Recent research highlights the potential for climate change mitigation projects and large-
scale land deals to produce conflicts over land and resources. However, this literature 
generally views climate change policies and land grabbing as separate processes, and 
focuses on discrete areas where displacement or
 contested claims occur. We argue that 
additional research strategies are needed to understand the social and ecological spill-over 
effects that take place within larger areas where land-based climate change projects (e.g. 
biofuel production, forest conservation, or hydroelectric projects) and large land-based 
investments (e.g. plantations or mines) are found. We propose adopting a landscape 
perspective to study intersections and complex interactions within and across social, 
ecological and institutional domains. By co-producing knowledge with local actors, building 
capacity with civil society groups, and informing advocacy that targets policy processes at 
multiple scales, we suggest that such research could contribute to preventing, resolving or 
transforming conflicts – even in places where difficult political transitionLand

“They are the two most important committees for us to meet,” Woods said on Thursday, as the activists prepared to leave for the Burmese capital Naypyidaw. “If these committees won’t meet civil society groups from ethnic areas, where most land disputes are happening, then how do they expect to address these issues?”...";Paul Vrieze;;The Irrawaddy;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;09-05-2013;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61650;http://www.irrawaddy.org/conflict/ethnic-activists-warn-of-surge-in-land-grabs-after-ceasefires.html;;;;
OBL:58154;Critical Point - Food Scarcity and Hunger in Burma’s Chin State _ 2008 (Special Reports);;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ""The military regime of Burma has been consistent in their inability and unwillingness to protect and provide for the people of Burma. Burma’s human rights record provides testimony of decades of widespread violations and abuses perpetrated largely at the hands of Burma’s military rulers and their agents against the Burmese people. Dissent is regularly silenced and opponents brutalized. In a country once known as the “rice-bowl of Asia,” Burma is now one of the poorest countries of Asia due to steady economic deterioration driven by the regime’s mismanagement. Many in Burma live without access to proper schools, healthcare facilities, reliable electricity, safe drinking water, and stable food supplies. Cowed by policies of extreme oppression and tactics of intimidation, life for much of the population in Burma is a struggle for daily survival. Add to that a natural disaster- and survival in Burma reaches a critical point. Western Burma’s Chin State is at such a point. Since 2006, the region has been plagued by a severe food crisis following a steep reduction in the local harvest and food production. The year 2006 marked the beginning of a new cycle of bamboo flowering, which occurs about every 50 years in the region, triggering an explosion in the population of rats and resulting in the destruction of crops. This has caused a severe shortage of food for local communities primarily dependent on subsistence farming through shifting cultivation. The phenomenon has been documented three times since 1862, and each past event ended in a disastrous famine for the communities in the area. Compounding the impending food crisis in Chin State due to the bamboo flowering is the continuation of severe human rights violations and repressive economic policies of the military regime, which serve to further undermine the livelihoods and food security of the Chin people. The use of unpaid civilian forced labour is widespread throughout Chin State, which consumes the time and energy of local farmers and reduces their crop yields. The regime also forcibly orders farmers to substitute their staple crops for other cash crops, and has confiscated thousands of acres of farmland from local farmers for tea and jatropha plantations. Meanwhile, arbitrary taxes and mandatory “donations” collected from Chin households by the Burmese authorities total up to as much 200,000 Kyats a year in major towns.2 This includes the unofficial collection of money from the Chin public by officials in various government departments at the local level to support such programs as tea and bio-fuel plantations; and extortion and confiscation of money, properties, and livestock by military units stationed at 33 locations across the state. The rising cost of living and skyrocketing food prices is also adding to the already dire humanitarian situation in Chin State. In the last four years, the price of rice has quintupled from 6,000 Kyats a bag in 2004 to as much as 30,000 Kyats today, an amount equivalent to the monthly salary of entry level public servants. The humanitarian consequences stemming from the dying bamboo and exacerbated by conditions imposed by the regime are enormous, and there are clear indications that unless urgent action is taken to address the crisis, the situation could soon turn into a large-scale catastrophe affecting all parts of Chin State. The hardest hit areas are in the southern townships of Matupi and Paletwa where bamboo grows heavily, but reports suggest that severe food shortages are a state-wide phenomenon with many villages in the northern townships of Tonzang and Thantlang, for example, having already run out of food supplies. Based on the latest field surveys conducted in the affected areas, Chin Human Rights Organization (CHRO) estimates that as many as 200 villages may be directly affected by severe food shortages associated with the bamboo flowering, and no less than 100, 000 people or 20 percent of the entire population of Chin State may be in need of immediate food aid.3 Food scarcity is more severe in remote areas, where families are being reduced to one meal a day or have nothing left to eat at all. CHRO recently visited four border villages in India’s Mizoram State where it found 93 families from 22 villages in Paletwa Township, Chin State who fled across the border in search of food.
To date, Burma’s State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has done nothing positive to counter the food scarcity, nor has the SPDC provided any kind of help to communities affected by the food crisis. Repeated requests by affected communities for food aid were denied, even as 100,000 metric tonnes of rice was exported to Sri Lanka.4 Rather, Burma Army soldiers have seized food aid donated by private donors and church groups.5 In contrast to the situation in Burma, India’s Mizoram and Manipur States, both adjacent to Chin State, are facing a similar food crisis related to the bamboo flowering, and have received millions of dollars in aid from the central government as well as international aid agencies, including USAID of the United States government, to support emergency programs to combat and manage the food crisis.6
In early May, when Cyclone Nargis ripped through lower Burma and the Irrawaddy delta destroying entire regions of land and leaving thousands homeless, hungry, and helpless, the regime clearly demonstrated their complete indifference to the plight of the Burmese people. In response to this natural disaster, they did shamefully little to ease the suffering of the victims and much to hamper relief efforts. As a result, the people of Burma paid a heavy price in the loss of life and continue to struggle under a regime that fails to protect or provide for its people. As another natural disaster unfolds in western Burma without hope of internal protections or provisions, the Chin people, like the cyclone victims, will be sure to pay a heavy toll unless action is taken immediately.

OBL:64805;Human rights abuses and obstacles to protection: Conditions for civilians amidst ongoing conflict in Dooplaya and Pa'an districts;;"Amidst ongoing conflict between the Tatmadaw and armed groups in eastern Dooplaya and Pa'an districts, civilians, aid workers and soldiers from state and non-state armies continue to report a variety of human rights abuses and security concerns for civilians in areas adjacent to Thailand's Tak Province, including: functionally indiscriminate mortar and small arms fire; landmines; arbitrary arrest and detention; sexual violence; and forced portering. Conflict and these conflict-related abuses have displaced thousands of civilians, more than 8,000 of whom are currently taking refuge in discreet hiding places in Thailand. This has interrupted education for thousands of children across eastern Dooplaya and Pa'an districts. The agricultural cycle for farmers has also been severely disrupted; many villagers have been prevented from completing their harvests of beans, corn and paddy crops, portending long-term threats to food security. Due to concerns about food security and disruption to children's education, as well as villagers' continuing need to protect themselves and their families from conflict and conflict-related abuse, temporary but consistent access to refuge in Thailand remains vital until villagers feel safe to return home. Even after return, food support will likely be necessary until disrupted agricultural activities can be resumed and civilians can again support themselves.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;21-01-2011;en;"mining;food security;land use;displacement;extractive industries;indigenous peoples;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64805;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2011/khrg11f2.pdf;;;;
OBL:64800;Militarization, Development and Displacement: Conditions for villagers in southern Tenasserim Division;;Villagers in Te Naw Th'Ri Township, Tenasserim Division face human rights abuses and threats to their livelihoods, attendant to increasing militarization of the area following widespread forced relocation campaigns in the late 1990s. Efforts to support and strengthen Tatmadaw presence throughout Te Naw Th'Ri have resulted in practices that facilitate control over the civilian population and extract material and labour resources while at the same time preventing non-state armed groups from operating or extracting resources of their own. Villagers who seek to evade military control and associated human rights abuses, meanwhile, report Tatmadaw attacks on civilians and civilian livelihoods in upland hiding areas. This report draws primarily on information received between September 2009 and November 2010 from Te Naw Th'Ri Township, Tenasserim Division.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;22-03-2011;en;"land conflicts;food security";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64800;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2011/khrg11f3.html;;;;

The question remains, though, as to whether the new government constitutes the beginning of a real shift from the blinkered despotism of its predecessors to a new form of government, or simply to a type of semi-enlightened and market-oriented despotism, the sort of which has been more common in Asia than the type of outright military domination experienced by Burma for most of the last half-century. ;;;Asian Human Rights Commission;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;10-12-2011;en;"land grabbing;security of tenure (land)";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/65821;http://burmalibrary.org/docs12/AHRC-Burma-2011-12.pdf;;;;
OBL:60274;Internal Displacement in Eastern Burma, 2006 Survey;;“Both tragedy and hope are reflected in this fifth annual survey of internal displacement in eastern Burma. The tragedy is that such systematic and widespread violations of human rights and humanitarian law continue to occur with national impunity and a largely ineffective international response. Yet it is the ongoing commitment and courage of ethnic community-based organisations to support grassroots coping strategies and document the impacts of conflict, violence and abuse which inspires hope for the future of Burma. The Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) has been collaborating with ethnic community-based organisations to document the scale, distribution and characteristics of internal displacement since 2002. Collectively, these surveys have aimed to raise awareness about vulnerability in eastern Burma and inform the development of humanitarian protection strategies. Recognising that conditions for the internally displaced are always changing, this year's survey attempted to update population estimates and assess trends across different areas in more detail with higher resolution maps. TBBC and the participating community-based organisations designed the surveys collaboratively by drawing from the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Although there were some changes for the sake of clarity, the questionnaire was similar to those used in previous years to facilitate trend analysis. Quantitative field surveys of the scale and distribution of internal displacement and the impacts of militarization and development have been based on interviews with key informants in 38 townships between June and August 2006. This has been complemented with qualitative field assessments about the causes and impacts of displacement which have been documented by community based organisations on an ongoing basis throughout the year. TBBC has previously reported that the Burmese Army has approximately doubled the deployment of battalions across eastern Burma since 1995. This survey has identified 204 infantry and light infantry battalions currently in eastern Burma, which represents approximately 40% of the government's frontline troops nation-wide. Such militarisation has facilitated the State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC's) counter-insurgency strategy which targets civilians in contravention of international humanitarian law. Accounts of such crimes against humanity have been documented by community based organisations in this report as contributing to conflict-induced displacement. State-sponsored development projects have done little to alleviate poverty in Burma, but have been significant causes of human rights abuses and displacement during the past year. The energy sector is Burma's largest recipient of foreign direct investment, but this report associates the gas pipeline in Mon State with forced labour, travel restrictions, and harassment. Similarly, proposed hydro-electric dams along the Salween River are linked with incidents of forced relocations, forced labour and the logging of community forests. Meanwhile commercial agriculture, and in particular the national development initiative to cultivate castor oil plants to produce bio-diesel, is reported to have induced widespread land confiscation, the imposition of procurement quotas and forced labour for the cultivation of seedlings. During the past year alone, this survey estimates that 82,000 people were forced to leave their homes as a result of, or in order to avoid, the effects of armed conflict and human rights abuses. These estimates are consistent with the annual average rate of displacement in eastern Burma since 2002, and reflect the SPDC's disregard for their responsibility to protect Burmese citizens from harm. While the distribution of forced migration during the past year was widespread, the most significant concentration was in northern Karen State and eastern Pegu Division. Counter-insurgency operations are reported to have killed at least 39 civilians and displaced over 27,000 others in this area during the past year. While the majority of people displaced during the past year fled in small groups, 232 entire villages were destroyed, forcibly relocated or otherwise abandoned. When combined with the findings of previous field surveys, 3,077 separate incidents of village destruction, relocation or abandonment have been documented in eastern Burma since 1996. Over a million people are understood to have been displaced from their homes in eastern Burma during this time. This reflects the cumulative impact of the Burmese Army's expanded presence and forced relocation campaign targeting civilians in contested areas. Some of these villages may have since been re-established, and indeed this survey has identified 155 villages that were at least partly repopulated during the past year. However, the sustainability of return and resettlement is restricted not only by livelihood constraints but also by the lack of official authorisation. Indeed, attempts to re-establish over 100 villages in previous years have already been thwarted by harassment leading to further rounds of displacement. The total number of internally displaced persons who have been forced or obliged to leave their homes and have not been able to return or resettle and reintegrate into society as of November 2006 is estimated to be at least 500,000 people. This population is comprised of approximately 287,000 people currently in the temporary settlements of ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities, while 95,000 civilians are estimated to be hiding from the SPDC in areas most affected by military skirmishes and approximately 118,000 villagers have followed SPDC eviction orders and moved into designated relocation sites. These are conservative estimates for eastern Burma as it has not been possible to survey urban areas nor mixed administration areas. Overall this represents a decrease of approximately 40,000 internally displaced persons since October 2005. This is due to a decrease of 53,000 people in the estimates for ceasefire areas. Population movements have been recorded out of areas administered by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) due to lack of livelihood opportunities. Estimates in other ceasefire areas of Shan and Karenni states have also decreased, reflecting how the areas administered by non state actors have effectively been reduced by the expansion of SPDC control. While many of these villagers may remain internally displaced, it has not been possible to track their current status. Conversely, the number of people in relocation sites has increased by approximately 10,000 people. This is partly a result of broader survey reach in Tenasserim Division and partly due to new incidents of forced relocation in Shan State. However, a significant decrease has been recorded in Mon state, where restrictions on resettlement away from relocation sites have eased. Rather than reflecting increased freedom, this illustrates that as villagers in surrounding areas become resigned to complying with Burmese Army orders, the government's perceived need for relocation sites becomes redundant. While the overall estimates for people in hiding sites increased only slightly, there has been a significant increase in northern Karen State and eastern Pegu Division where approximately 55,000 villagers are currently hiding from government forces. This represents an increase of approximately 14,000 people since last year, and suggests that half of those displaced in the past year were previously living with the tacit approval of local SPDC authorities in mixed administration areas. These local arrangements offered little protection when the Southern and South Eastern Military Commands coordinated patrols by over 40 battalions to search for civilian settlements and destroy their means of survival...;;;The Border Consortium;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2006;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60274;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/TBBC-2006-IDP-ocr.pdf;;;;

OBL:73322;FOREST TENURE, RESTORATION AND GREEN GROWTH - Seventeenth RRI Dialogue on Forests, Governance, and Climate Change (text and video);;"A video recording of a whole-day conference held on 18 June 2015. The page begins with text presentations. For the video recordings of the event, scroll down to Webcasts.....""Co-Organized by RRI and IUCN, in partnership with the Embassy of France in Washington, DC...

Recent years have seen increased global attention and commitment to forest landscape restoration (FLR) as a strategy to mitigate climate change, enhance ecological services, and create new economic opportunities in rural areas. Initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge, calling for the restoration of 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded lands by 2020, and forest restoration commitments within the New York Declaration on Forests demonstrate the significant global momentum behind forest restoration as a “nature-based” solution. Some countries have made FLR a major component of their green growth strategies, indicating the potential of these efforts to garner significant economic benefits beyond climate mitigation.

Increasingly, experience and evidence show that forest governance and tenure reforms supporting the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples are key factors in the success of forest restoration initiatives. Recognizing rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to forests creates incentives for long-term investments in forest restoration and management, enables communities to share in benefits generated from restoration activities, and provides the basis for forest-based enterprises and rural economic growth. Secure tenure is also necessary to unlock locally-driven solutions and ensure that forest restoration initiatives do not contribute to “land grabbing” and increased conflict over land use in forest areas.

As forest restoration initiatives scale up around the world – an area the size of France has been restored in the last three years – it is especially important to highlight the challenges and opportunities of advancing forest restoration in a socially inclusive manner, respecting and promoting tenure rights and ensuring that local communities join in the design and benefits of restoration initiatives.

Gathering prominent national and international decision makers, experts and key representatives of indigenous peoples, local communities, governments, and civil society organizations, this Dialogue built a common understanding of the links among forest tenure, restoration and green growth, and share lessons from local experience on ways to strengthen these links. It also identified policy opportunities and distilled key messages to inform relevant policy discussions including the UNFCCC Conference of Parties meeting in Paris later in the year, the various REDD+ initiatives, as well as the Green Climate Fund.";;;Rights and Resources Initiative;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;18-06-2015;en;"capacity building;land governance;land grabbing;land tenure;forestry;land rights;local community;forest land;land tenure systems";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73322;http://www.rightsandresources.org;;;;
OBL:74460;Is Myanmar’s Peace Process Unraveling?;;"Over the last three weeks, fighting has broken out in Myanmar’s northeast between the military and several ethnic minority militias, including the ethnic Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and, allegedly, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). The KIA is one of the most powerful insurgent groups in Myanmar. At least 30,000 civilians have fled across the border into China, and the fighting has killed at least 130 people. The Myanmar military has attacked rebel groups with air strikes, and the fighting shows no sign of letting up.

The fighting began on February 9, when Kokang rebels attacked government troops in the town of Laukkai and the Myanmar army launched a fierce counterattack. The exact reasons for the clash on February 9 remain somewhat unclear. The fighting may stem from a personal feud between the Kokang group’s leader and the Myanmar armed forces’ commander in chief, or it may have been sparked by a desire by the Kokang militia to take back control of Laukkai. Or, the attack may have been retaliation for previous unreported attacks on Kokang fighters by the Myanmar military. Or, it may have stemmed from a dispute over drug trafficking and its profits; the northeast of Myanmar is one of the biggest producers of opium and synthetic methamphetamine stimulants in Asia.

Still, the broader security environment in Myanmar clearly has played a role in this recent outbreak of fighting. Indeed, the Kokang clashes with the Burmese army are reflective of several disturbing trends in Myanmar – trends that, if they continue, could undermine the country’s peace process and possibly lead to a wider outbreak of civil war...";Joshua Kurlantzick;;[US] Council on Foreign Relations;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;24-02-2015;en;"land conflicts;displacement";Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74460;http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2015/02/24/is-myanmars-peace-process-unraveling/;;;;

OBL:100828;Myanmar: Land Tenure Issues and the Impact on Rural Development;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
""Myanmar’s agricultural sector has for long suffered due to multiplicity of laws and regulations, deficient and degraded infrastructure, poor policies and planning, a chronic lack of credit, and an absence of tenure security for cultivators. These woes negate Myanmar’s bountiful natural endowments and immense agricultural potential, pushing its rural populace towards dire poverty.
This review hopes to contribute to the ongoing debate on land issues in Myanmar. It focuses on land tenure issues vis-à-vis rural development and farming communities since reforms in this sector could have a significant impact on farmer innovation and investment in agriculture and livelihood sustainability. Its premise is that land and property rights cannot be understood solely as an administrative or procedural issue, but should be considered part of broader historical, economic, social, and cultural dimensions.
Discussions were conducted with various stakeholders; the government’s inter-ministerial committee mandated to develop the National Action Plan for Agriculture (NAPA) served as the national counterpart. Existing literature was also reviewed. Limitations of the review included:
• maintaining inclusiveness without losing focus of critical aspects such as food security;
• the lack of a detailed discussion on the administration and management of forest land which is outside its purview; and
an evolving regulatory environment with work currently underway on the new draft of the National Land-Use Policy (NLUP) and Land-Use Certificates (LUCs) for farmlands (Phase One work)...";"Shivakumar Srinivas

OBL:72254;FAO/WFP CROP AND FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENT MISSION TO MYANMAR;;"Highlights:
•
Cyclone Komen made landfall in Myanmar at the end of July 2015
causing extensive flooding to
agricultural land, which remained
submerged
in some areas until September. This caused severe 
localized losses to the 2015 monsoon season crops, especially p
addy, in Chin, Rakhine,
Ayeyarwaddy, Yangon, Sagaing
and parts of Bago. However, once the water receded, a large portion 
of the flooded areas with paddy was replanted. Overall, the amount of irreversible damage was 
limited.
•
At 27.5 million tonnes, the 
aggregate 
national production
of paddy, 
the country’s staple food, in
2015 
(monsoon season 2015 and ongoing 2015 secondary season) would be 3 percent below the 2014 
crop and 2 percent down 
from
the average of the past
three
-
years.
•
At subnational level, however, 
cereal 
production and livelihood of farming households and 
communities in remote areas, in particular Chin and Rakhine, which concentrate highly vulnerable 
populations with little resilience and low agricultural productivity, did not recover fully as in other areas 
affected by the flooding. These populations may face severe food shortages in the coming months 
and require relief assistance.
•
Livestock and fisheries were affected by the flooding in localized areas with losses of cattle, buffalo, 
sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, and damage to fish and shrimp farms, resulting in reduced animal 
protein intake in the most affected areas. 
•
The country is a net exporter of rice and the 2015 paddy production, similar to previous years,
will 
exceed domestic requirements, but tighter 
domestic 
supplies in marketing year 2015/16 
(October/September) 
are expected to
further
underpin 
already high rice prices, raising
concerns about 
food access by most vulnerable sections of the population.
•
Prices of rice reached record levels in August and September 
2015, 
reflecting strong 
depreciation
of 
the 
Kyat, increasing rice exports and 
concerns about the damage to paddy crop. Domestic rice prices 
declined with the harvest 
between October and December 2015 
but remained at
high levels. 
In
February
2016, 
rice 
prices 
averaged 37
percent higher than a
year earlier.
•
For the majority of farming households,
the main impact of the July flooding 
was
related to the 
increased costs for replanting and 
the delayed harvest. 
Households depending primarily upon day 
labour, and especially non-skilled day labour, re
main among the most vulnerable. They faced a gap in 
wages during August and have difficulties in obtaining credit.
•
The July flooding was perceived to have moderate impact on children’s nutritional status and little 
impact on infant and young children feeding practices.
•
In view of the 
country’s adequate rice availabilities
and 
generally 
well-functioning
domestic markets, 
the Mission recommends that any 
eventual
food assistance 
needs
to 
be 
provided
in the form of cash 
and/
or vouchers.
•
To cover immediate 
agricultural needs following the 2015 flooding, the Mission recommends the 
distribution of seeds for the next monsoon planting season; 
as well as 
water and pest-resistant 
storage containers to protect farmer’s seeds, along with drying nets and post-harvest
equipment
in the 
most affected areas. In 
Rakhine, Sagaing
and Ayeyarwaddy, recording the highest livestock losses, 
urgent 
restocking
of livestock is required to avoid a 
further 
fall in animal protein intake; while the 
rebuilding of fishing gear and boats
and the
rehabilitation of fish ponds is 
also 
needed
in the most 
affected Rakhine State.";"Swithun Goodbody

""A dozen or so years ago, Mee Reh was helping to secure a rebel-held area of Burma’s eastern Karenni State with landmines. Today he is helping to secure a new life for landmine victims.

 

Mee Reh, 38, is one of 11 workers making artificial limbs at a small workshop in a Karenni refugee camp in Thailand’s northern Mae Hong Son province. The enterprise is run by Handicap International, an international organization working to ban the use of landmines and to help landmine victims.

 

Mee Reh is himself the victim of a landmine explosion, losing a leg while he was in action with Karenni National Progressive Party forces against Burma Army troops in the early 1990s. He found medical care in neighboring Thailand, where he was fitted with an artificial leg. After his recovery he found work in the Handicap International Workshop, which has so far manufactured around 100 prostheses.

Some of the negative impacts and mitigation measures include: for all projects that are proposed for Bank financing and affect Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation. The Bank provides project financing only where free, prior, and informed consultation results in broad community support to the project by the affected Indigenous Peoples. Such Bank-financed projects include measures to (a) avoid potentially adverse effects on the Indigenous Peoples’ communities; or (b) when avoidance is not feasible, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects. Bank-financed projects are also designed to ensure that the Indigenous Peoples receive social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate and gender and inter-generationally inclusive; ensure that ethnic minorities and other vulnerable people are meaningfully consulted and that they receive project benefits in a culturally appropriate manner; prevent and, where unavoidable, fully compensate loss in livelihood associated with or caused by the project; and develop the capacity of the implementation agencies to manage environmental and social impacts in partnership with the affected communities";"Ignacio

""In Alice in Wonderland, the Red Queen tells Alice: “A word means what I want it to mean.” That sums up in one sentence the state of Burma’s statute books—particularly those decrees relating to mining the country’s rich resources.

 

 

Robert Moody, in his 1998 “Report on Mining in Burma,” put it more directly. The law on mining passed by the Rangoon regime in 1994, he said, “is not just one, but a parade of farts in a bucket.”

 

The law makes no provisions for holding mining companies responsible for failure to stabilize workings and waste piles, nor for rehabilitating closed mines. There are no requirements for an environmental and reclamation bond to be posted by a mining company, no need for an environment and social impact assessment, nor for an independent monitor to ensure compliance during mining and post-closure operations.The law allows private citizens to prospect for gold, but they are not permitted to use machinery. People granted permits must sign an agreement to turn over 30 percent of their refined gold to the Ministry of Mines. Citizens are also permitted to pan for placer gold found in streams, although they are increasingly being edged out by Chinese contractors dredging the Irrawaddy River...";Charles Large;;The Irrawaddy;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2005;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/41950;http://www2.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=5082;;;;

Recommendations to empower migrant children and youth in the Mekong sub-region... 
""This report provides an awareness of the realities and perspectives among migrant children, youth and their communities, as a means of building respect and partnerships to address their vulnerabilities to exploitation and abusive environments. The needs and concerns of migrants along the borders of China, Myanmar and Thailand are highlighted and recommendations to address these are made.

The main findings of the participatory action research include:

 * those most impacted by migration are the peoples along the mountainous border areas between China, Myanmar and Thailand, who represent a variety of ethnic groups
 * both the countries of origin and countries of destination find that those migrating are largely young people and often include children
 * there is little awareness as to young migrants' concerns and needs, with extremely few interventions undertaken to reach out to them
 * the majority of the cross-border migrants were young, came from rural areas and had little or no formal education
 * the decision to migrate is complex and usually involves numerous overlapping factors
 * migrants travelled a number of routes that changed frequently according to their political and economic situations. The vast majority are identified as illegal immigrants
 * generally, migrants leave their homes not knowing for certain what kind of job they will actually find abroad. The actual jobs available to migrants were very gender specific
 * though the living and working conditions of cross-border migrants vary according to the place, job and employer, nearly all the participants noted their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse without protection or redress
 * for all illnesses, most of the participants explained that it was difficult to access public health services due to distance, cost and/or their illegal status
 * along all the borders, most of the children did not attend school and among those who did only a very few had finished primary level education
 * drug production, trafficking and addiction were critical issues identified by the communities at all of the research sites along the borders
 * child labour was found in all three countries
 * trafficking of persons, predominantly children and youth, was common at all the study sites
 * orphaned children along the border areas were found to be the most vulnerable
* Migrants frequently considered their options and opportunities to return home

Based on the project’s findings, recommendations are made at the conclusion of this report to address the critical issues faced by migrant children and youth along the borders. These recommendations include: methods of working with migrant youth, effective interventions, strategies for advocacy, identification of vulnerable populations and critical issues requiring further research.

The following interventions were identified as most effective in empowering migrant children and youth in the Mekong sub-region: life skills training and literacy education, strengthening protection efforts, securing channels for safe return and providing support for reintegration to home countries. These efforts need to be initiated in tandem with advocacy efforts to influence policies and practices that will better protect and serve migrant children and youth.";Therese M.

The District has 3 townships: Ler Doh (Kyauk Kyi in Burmese), Hsaw Tee (Shwegyin), and Mone. The eastern two-thirds of the district is covered by forested hills dotted with small Karen villages, and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) operates extensively in this region. The western part of the district is in the plains of the Sittaung river basin; here there are larger villages of mixed Karen and Burman population, and this area is under strong SPDC control. For several years now SLORC/SPDC forces have tried to destroy Karen resistance in the eastern hills, largely by forcing villagers to move and wiping out their ability to produce food. Many villages in the parts of these eastern hills bordering PapunDistrict have been destroyed since 1997 as part of the SPDC campaign to wipe out Karen villages in northern Papun and eastern Nyaunglebin Districts (see ""Wholesale Destruction"", KHRG, April 1998).

OBL:58791;Arbitrary Confiscation of Farmers’ Land by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Military Regime in Burma;;"Abstract""
""This research was framed by a human rights approach to development as pursued by Amartya
Sen. Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development but they are the principle means of
development. The research was informed by international obligations to human rights and was placed
within a context of global pluralism and recognition of universal human dignity. The first research aim
was to study the State Peace and Development Council military regime confiscation of land and labour of
farmers in villages of fourteen townships in Rangoon, Pegu, and Irrawaddy Divisions and Arakan,
Karenni, and Shan States. Four hundred and sixty-seven individuals were interviewed to gain
understanding of current pressures facing farmers and their families. Had crops, labour, household food,
assets, farm equipment been confiscated? If so, by whom, and what reason was given for the
confiscation? Were farmers compensated for this confiscation? How did family households respond and
cope when land was confiscated? In what ways were farmers contesting the arbitrary confiscation of their
land?
A significant contribution of this research is that it was conducted inside Burma with considerable
risk for all individuals involved. People who spoke about their plight, who collected information, and who
couriered details of confiscation across the border into Thailand were at great risk of arrest. Interviews
were conducted clandestinely in homes, fields, and sometimes during the night. Because of personal
security risks there are inconsistent data sets for the townships. People revealed concerns of health,
education, lack of land tenure and livelihood. Several farmers are contesting the confiscation of their
land, but recognise that there is no rule by law or independent judiciary in Burma. Farmers and their
family members want their plight to be known internationally. When they speak out they are threatened
with detention. Their immediate struggle is to survive.
The second aim was to analyse land laws and land use in Burma from colonial times,
independence in 1948, to the present military rule by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).
The third aim was to critically review international literature on land tenure and land rights with special
focus on research conducted in post-conflict, post-colonial, and post-socialist nations and how to resolve
land claims in face of no documentation. We sought ideas and practices which could inform creation of
land laws, land and property rights, in democratic transition in Burma.";"Dr. Nancy Hudson-Rodd; Sein Htay";;The Burma Fund;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-01-2008;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing;land rights";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/58791;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/Arbitrary_confiscation-ncgub.pdf;;;;

OBL:71360;INVISIBLE LIVES: The Untold Story of Displacement Cycle in Burma - English, Burmese (??????????);;"Executive Summary:
""Recently, much attention surrounding Burma has focused on the democratic reform, 2015
elections and the future of the National League for Democracy (NLD)-led Government, whilst
a profound humanitarian crisis and continuing concerns of the ethnic minority communities in
the southeast have been largely ignored. The recent story of political and economic reform
has insufficiently addressed the ongoing struggles of internally displaced persons (IDPs), as
they become an inconvenient truth rendered invisible by the larger reform narrative.
Nearly 70 years of ethnic conflict has created a displacement crisis with over 644,000
internally displaced and over 479,000 refugees fleeing the country predominantly from ethnic
areas. At present, over 100,000 refugees live in camps along the Thailand-Burma border,
and approximately 400,000 IDPs live in protracted displacement in southeast Burma. As the
continuing political and social transformation in Burma and the triumph of the NLD in the 2015
elections captivates local citizens and foreign observers around the world, optimism and the
infectious idea that those displaced will soon begin to move back to Burma has led to further
decline in donor funding along the Thailand-Burma border.
This has deeply impacted the refugees and IDPs living along the border whose lives depend
on international aid as well as essential services and programs offered by local ethnic
service providers, which were traditionally funded by the international donor community. Many
refugees are now feeling squeezed out of the camps, bearing a resemblance to the experience
of Mon refugees who were pushed back across the border to Burma and became IDPs
over 20 years ago. As expressed by many Mon IDPs interviewed for this report, they have yet
to find durable livelihood solutions in IDP sites and continue to suffer from chronic poverty,
debt and lack of medical care. Inside Burma, stagnation in amending repressive laws, military
dominance in politics, the absence of an inclusive ceasefire and political dialogue, the presence
of landmines and land confiscation that has become endemic throughout the country
continue to render the definition of a safe and dignified voluntary return of refugees meaningless.
As plans to repatriate over 100,000 refugees along the border continue to be discussed,
there is an increasing need to reflect on the past and draw lessons that could prevent a future
protracted IDP situation in the country. This report aims to shed light on lessons that can be

learned from the past for all stakeholders involved in all stages of planning for the return of
refugees and IDPs.
While the IDPs interviewed for this report expressed their desire to stay in their current
locations as opposed to relocation or return to their original location, they often cited two major
obstacles to their possible return: not having land to return to and continuing considerations
about safety including lack of sustainable peace in their place of origin.
The plight of villagers and farmers in Ye and Yebyu Township in their struggle to preserve
and protect their land from the Burma Army, the State and private investors indicate that refugees
and IDPs are likely to face increasing housing, land and property (HLP) rights violations
upon their return. These HLP rights violations must be resolved not only to ensure the durable
return of IDPs and refugees, but also to end further displacement that is adding to the already
vast number of displaced people inside and out of the country. Steps must also be taken to
ensure that a genuine and inclusive peace process remains a priority, as it is only through an
inclusive ceasefire and sustainable peace that a durable solution can be found for the disenfranchised
and displaced communities in Burma.
Community-based organizations (CBOs), ethnic service providers, and grassroots movements
with decades of experience and knowledge that have worked side-by-side with their
communities through difficult and challenging times are tackling these very issues and concerns
that the IDPs, refugees and villagers are facing. As the new NLD-led Government has
begun to take the reins of the political and economic reforms set in motion by the previous
government, all parties must ensure that the efforts of those who have consistently worked
alongside ethnic communities are supported and advocated, and not sidelined.
HLP rights of refugees and IDPs must be restored, laws that are legacies of the past must
be amended, landmines must be cleared from the land and an inclusive ceasefire followed
by a political solution is needed to protect them from further abuse and possible secondary
displacement before a durable livelihood solution can be achieved. National reconciliation
is possible only when victims begin receiving the support they need to ensure that they can
rebuild their lives in safety and dignity.";;;"Human Rights Foundation of Monland;Burma Link";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;12-08-2016;"en;my";"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71360;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/HURFOM-2016-08-12-Invisible-lives-en-red.spdf.pdf;;;;

OBL:71414;UNDERNUTRITION IN MYANMAR Part 2: A Secondary Analysis of LIFT 2013 Household Survey Data;;"Executive Summary:
""The multi-donor Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) commenced operations in Myanmar in 2010, supporting implementing partners (IPs) to assist poor families to increase their food availability and incomes in three of the country‘s main agro-ecological zones: the Uplands, Dry Zone, and Delta Zone. LIFT programming was later initiated in Rakhine State in the Coastal Zone. LIFT has funded a consortium of Save the Children (SCI), Action Contre la Faim (ACF) and Helen Keller International, to implement the LEARN project. The goal of this three-year project (December 2012 – December 2015) is to build the capacity of IPs and to provide technical support to LIFT to maximize the nutritional impact of their food security and livelihoods (FSL) programming throughout the country.
In 2013, LIFT contracted ICF International, Inc., which worked with Myanmar Survey Research, to carry out its second household survey that included 2,400 LIFT households and 800 comparison households in 200 villages. In order to better understand the contributing factors of undernutrition in LIFT program areas and the links between child nutritional status and independent variables of programmatic importance to LIFT (such as income, livelihoods, food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene [WASH]), LEARN commissioned a secondary analysis of nutrition-related data from the 2013 LIFT Household Survey.

OBL:71415;UNDERNUTRITION IN MYANMAR Part 1: A Critical Review of Literature;;"Abstract:
""Despite improvements in recent years, the prevalence of undernutrition among women and children in Myanmar remains unacceptably high. One in three children are stunted and about 8% are acutely malnourished. Micronutrient deficiencies are common among infants, young children and pregnant women. In fact, more than 80% of children 6 to 23 months of age and 70% of pregnant women are anemic. To better understand the determinants of undernutrition and the linkages between food security, livelihoods and nutrition in Myanmar as a whole as well as in specific geographic areas where programs supported by the Livelihoods, Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) are being implemented, the LEARN project has reviewed food and nutrition security data from the past five years and synthesized relevant findings into this user-friendly report.
Guided by the conceptual framework of the determinants of undernutrition initially developed by UNICEF and adapted by the authors of the 2008 Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, this report presents what is known about the immediate determinants of undernutrition and how they are affected by underlying food security, caregiving, and environmental conditions, which are in turn shaped by income poverty, lack of access to capital and basic economic and social conditions. As the purpose of this report is as much to present what is known about food and nutrition security in Myanmar as it is to identify what is not known, the structure of the report is intended to highlight gaps in knowledge and areas for further research. Following the Introduction, Section 2 presents national level data on the food and nutrition security situation in Myanmar in the past five years. Sections 3, 4 and 5 present data on food and nutrition security from the various agro-ecological zones that are of interest to LIFT, namely the Coastal/Delta, Dry, and Uplands. Each section is organized in the same way, beginning with data on the prevalence of undernutrition in the geographic area, followed by findings on potential causes of undernutrition, organized according to immediate, underlying and basic determinants.
This report will contribute to the overall knowledge base of the food and nutrition security sector as well as inform decisions related to the selection of interventions aimed at improving the nutritional status of families and communities in Myanmar.";Jennifer Cashin;;LIFT-Fund;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;29-02-2016;en;"food security;agriculture;rural development";Land & Food Security;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71415;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/LEARN-2016-UnderNutrition-in-Myanmar_Part_1-en.pdf;;;;
OBL:59170;MYANMAR: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR REVIEW INVESTMENT STRATEGY VOLUME 1 – SECTOR REVIEW;;"CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
The Government of Myanmar has made it clear that it recognises the crucial importance of a dynamic, liberalised agricultural sector to the country, describing it as the ‘base’ for national economic growth and calling for the evolution of a ‘market-oriented economic system’ as a key economic objective, while the first policy declaration of the MOAI is ‘to allow freedom of choice in agricultural production’. Yet more than a decade after the commencement of the transition from the previous Socialist regime, many aspects of the agricultural and rural economy remain substantially under Government control or influence, including the choice of crops to be planted, priorities for agricultural research and extension, access to inputs, processing and international trade...

The enormous potentials inherent in the agricultural and rural economy of Myanmar outlined in this document will continue to go unrealised unless the liberalisation process started in the late 1980s is encouraged to fully evolve. Although moves such as the liberalisation of rice marketing in 2003 should be welcomed, their impact is often reduced by a subsequent tightening of state controls – as indeed has been the case with the reintroduction of the prohibition on private sector exports of rice just a few months later. This study has identified a number of important technical issues that need to be addressed in order to facilitate the growth of the sector1, however, it must be understood that the impact of investment in the rural sector will be greatly lessened in the absence of continued liberalisation measures...
The three policy areas which are exerting the greatest influence on sector development at this time are those relating to rural financial services, international trade and directed production. The liberalisation of rural finances is critical because state-controlled structures (e.g. MADB) are currently unable to provide farmers and other rural entrepreneurs with access to the financing they need to increase productivity. This lack of financing reduces the use of inputs, limits the adoption of new technologies, constrains the development of unutilised land and encourages low cost/low output production. Furthermore, by forcing rural populations to use much higher cost credit from informal sources it is, without doubt, a major factor in increasing rural indebtedness and poverty. Limitations on access to international markets are almost equally important, as they prevent the sector from identifying, and responding to, those opportunities which will provide the greatest returns, both for their families and for the country as a whole. The result has been to distort production patterns towards perceived national priorities, at the expense of economic growth. Finally, the continued use of directed production for perceived strategic crops limits the ability of the agricultural sector to seek out and adopt the most productive and profitable activities, effectively preventing its evolution in a rapidly changing world...
The temptation to solve economic problems through direct intervention is an age old one, and it is not surprising that the Government sees intervention as an effective instrument for achieving short-term goals, such as maintaining low consumer prices, guaranteeing supplies, or reducing expenditure of scarce foreign currency – even when this is in conflict with its own broader national policies. Nevertheless, action in one area has inevitable consequences elsewhere, many of which may not be anticipated. As many countries have discovered, one intervention often requires another intervention to resolve an unintended side-effect. Consequently, such intervention should be used very sparingly, if at all, and alternative approaches, which do not conflict with basic national policies should be sought instead...
With ASEAN integration now a likely prospect in the medium term, growing pressures from international globalisation, and strong indications of increasing poverty in rural areas, a continuation of the partial liberalization regime effectively in place at the moment will prove difficult to maintain and is likely to further constrain economic growth and development. Myanmar may ultimately have to choose between broad choices: To return to the socialist model of the 1970s and 1980s, and in so doing effectively disconnect the country from the international and regional economic system; or to push forward with existing national policies of economic liberalisation and realize the great potential of Myanmar as an agricultural producer and exporter. While the second choice will bring with it many challenges, few doubt that the agricultural sector in Myanmar can be a competitive force in the world economy, and the growth that such
competitiveness would bring could both reduce rural poverty and catalyse the development of the rest of the economy.
14.95 Finally, it is worth noting that experience across a broad spectrum of developing countries has shown that food security is most prevalent when national policies influencing the productive sectors of the economy have a marked pro-poor orientation. In a predominantly rural economy such as that of Myanmar, agricultural growth provides the most opportunities for pro-poor development, as long as the poor are central to the process. This requires not only access to appropriate technical, financial and physical resources for production, as well as associated services such as health, sanitation, water supply and education, but also an economic and policy environment which enables rural households to respond to market demand and benefit from their contribution to national growth.";;;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2003;en;"land policies;food security;land governance";Land & Food Security;Land Policy & Legislation;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59170;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/FAO-ASR-MainReport2004.pdf;;;;

The government estimates that over 1.4 million acres of farmland have been inundated from June to August, destroying more than 667,000 acres of crops and significant damage to livestock, causing food insecurity amongst the population. While floods have receded in some areas and people have started to return to their homes, some still remain in evacuation centres.

OBL:71569;Our Customary Lands - Community-Based Sustainable Natural Resource Management in Burma;;"Executive summary:
""In January 2016 the government adopted a National Land Use Policy, which included the recognition
of customary land management practices. While this is a welcome first step in the necessary
integration of Burma’s customary land management systems with the national-level system,
there is an urgent need for constitutional reform and devolution of land management powers
prior to any such integration.
This report by the Ethnic Community Development Forum (ECDF) presents how Burma’s diverse
customary land management systems in seven ethnic communities are structured, and
provides ideas for how these systems could be supported and potentially integrated into a future
devolved federal national land management system.
Customary land management systems have co-existed with the national land management system
in Burma for centuries.
The national land management system is highly centralized and has facilitated widespread
land grabbing for natural resource extraction and agribusiness projects, resulting in loss of livelihoods
and environmental degradation throughout the country. Updated Land Laws adopted
in 2012 were based on poorly defined land classification and despite some democratic reforms,
the military maintains a central role in land management through the General Administration
Department. Upland agricultural lands – mainly tilled by ethnic nationalities practicing shifting
cultivation – are defined by law as either forest lands or as vacant, virgin and fallow lands. Lands
defined as “vacant, virgin and fallow” are particularly problematic as these are designated for
“State Economic Development” and contracted to extractive industries, agribusiness and infrastructure
development projects.
Customary land management systems have operated independently of the national government
since colonial days and independence, due to lack of government access into remote ethnic
areas and decades of civil war. In recent years, ethnic resistance governments in Karen and Mon
States have developed their own land registration and management systems in order to protect
the land rights and interests of ethnic farmers in areas governed by these ethnic governments.
These systems, in contrast to the national land management systems, are decentralized and have
evolved/adapted to local situations and needs, prioritizing sustainable livelihoods and environmental
protection.
The ECDF has conducted grassroots participatory research and issued publications on customary
land systems in Burma’s ethnic states since 2014. This has included: conducting a household
survey in 26 townships; commissioning a report on international experiences with customary
land management systems; and facilitating participatory community research in order to document
the land management systems in seven ethnic villages located in six states. Summary findings
of this research include:
a) Customary practices have been passed on for many generations and have sustained
strong connections between villagers and their lands:
Communities that are practicing customary land management have been living on their lands
for many generations, passing their lands and traditions onto their children and grandchildren.
Community members regard land as more than just a commodity which has no spiritual connection
to the nature that has produced these resources. The administrative and cultural institutions
that have arisen among ethnic groups over numerous generations of living on their lands are tied
closely to the geographic features of their lands, as well as the experiences about how to best
conserve surrounding natural resources in order to survive and prosper. Everyday customs and
traditions, including the roles of those governing customary lands, are woven into the natural
environment where communities are based and the corresponding worldview that community
members have received from their ancestors.
b) Customary practices provide sustainable environmental protection:
Nearly all communities practicing customary land management reside in forests, and therefore
are dependent upon the health of these forest lands for their survival and livelihoods. Customary
communities have developed land use rules and regulations which have allowed sustainable use
of the forest for food, shelter and medicine without endangering long-term ecological health.
Villagers also preserve their natural resources by respecting the spirits of the trees, lakes, water
resources, animals and lands on ‘auspicious’ days each year and through composing stories and
poems in order to teach the new generations about protecting the community’s natural resources.
Customary Land communities have established a number of land use zones (community forests,
protected forests, reserved forests, use forests, watersheds, conservation areas and wildlife
conservation zones) – each with explicit rules that regulate the use of the lands and natural resources.
There is a wide range of classifi cations for these conservation areas.
c) Customary practices provide self-reliant and ecologically sustainable livelihoods:
A vast majority of community needs are produced or collected from local lands, forests and waters.
Apart from organized production of foods – through lowland and hillside agriculture as well
as livestock breeding – forest resources provide supplementary foods (wild fruits, vegetables
and animals); materials for housing and clothes; and herbal medicines. These communities have
regulations that prioritize ecologically sustainable, equitable and needs-based production rather
than extraction for sales and profit.
d) Customary practices provide local communities with eff ective decentralized and participatory
governance and judiciary systems:
Governance, judiciary and administrative systems exist in the communities that have evolved
over generations and are both participatory and resilient. Community members view the rules
and regulations as their own, and therefore adhere to them much more closely than a set of
regulations imposed upon them by outsiders. Elected village committees (including specific
committees for land, water and forest management) update, arbitrate and enforce village land
regulations. Important decisions are made with the participation of a majority of the villagers.
Customary land management systems are holistic and incorporate all lands, waterways and forests
within specified village boundaries.
Customary land management structures and policies have been integrated nationally in countries
on every continent. International institutions – including the World Bank – have stated the effectiveness
and effi ciency advantages of communal and customary tenure over formal individual
titles. The World Bank has also urged caution about state-led intervention in land tenure systems,
suggesting building on existing systems.
Protection and recognition of ethnic customary land management systems is an important component
in achieving sustainable peace and must be enshrined in a future federal constitution
and decentralized legal framework – one example of this is outlined at the end of this report. In
order to protect these lands and systems until peace accords, constitutional amendments and new
land legislation formalizing these systems have been fi nalized, there should be a moratorium
on land acquisition in areas where customary land management systems are being implemented
or were implemented before displacement due to armed conflicts.";;;Ethnic Community Development Forum (ECDF);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-07-2016;en;"land policies;property rights;customary law;customary tenure;land use planning;land use;land administration;land tenure systems;land rights;land law;local community;legal pluralism;land governance";Land Stakeholders & Institutions;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71569;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/ECDF-2016-07-05-our_customary_land-en-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:72062;Exploring the Socio-Economic Situation of Plantation Villagers: A Case Study in Bago Yoma;;"... Massive scale plantation forestry in Myanmar began in the early 1980s as a drastic measure to fulfil the increasing demand for timber and to prevent the conversion of deteriorated forestland to agricultural land. More than 30,000 ha of forest plantations have annually been formed since 1984 (Myanmar Forest Department 2000). Myanmar has also launched a Special Teak Plantation Program in 1998 which has an annual plantation target of 8000 ha in addition to the normal plantation scheme.

Myanmar Forest Department is recruiting shifting cultivators and applying the taungya method in plantation projects because it can avoid conflicts at the time of teak plantation establishment, achieve large plantation area targets in remote areas and overcome the problems of insufficient funding and insufficient labour. Further, as the plantation area is under the intensive care of taungya farmers for their intercrops, the Forest Department can expect a higher survival rate of trees for the first year.

The Forest Department is planning a joint venture by establishing plantation villages near or inside the reserved forests with the aim of securing labour for plantation establishment at reduced cost and with increased efficiency, as well as protecting the existing natural resources including old plantations more intensively with the participation of the taungya farmers. In brief, Myanmar Forest Department is trying to get people participation in the promotion of reforestation.

From the commencement of the project, the foresters have been arguing about whether the project would create forest protective groups or forest destructive groups. Past experiences suggest that taungya farmers are likely to destroy the plantations once they have been established. ‘Evidently there were destructions of many teak plantations and other plantations of valuable species during the Second World War (1942?45) and again during the 1988 pro-democracy movement by the villagers who had involved in establishment of those plantations’ (Ba Kaung 2001).

Why did the taungya farmers become destructive instead of the intended protective groups? In the author’s judgment, the underlying issue is an economic one, and it is essential to explore the socio-economic situations of the groups involved in taungya teak plantations...";"Tin Min Maung

This influence is both direct and indirect, through European corporate sector and public policies, as well as through multilateral agencies within which EU states are members.

OBL:72201;Marginal Lands or Marginal People? Analysing Key Processes Determining the Outcomes of LargeScale Land Acquisitions in Lao PDR and Cambodia;;This chapter aims to overcome the gap existing between case study research, which typically provides qualitative and process based insights, and national or global inventories that typically offer spatially explicit and quantitative analysis of broader patterns, and thus to present adequate evidence for policymaking regarding largescale land acquisitions. Therefore, the chapter links spatial patterns of land acquisitions to underlying implementation processes of land allocation. Methodologically linking the described patterns and processes proved difficult, but we have identified indicators that could be added to inventories and monitoring systems to make linkage possible. Combining complementary approaches in this way may help to determine where policy space exists for more sustainable governance of land acquisitions, both geographically and with regard to processes of agrarian transitions. Our spatial analysis revealed two general patterns: (i) relatively large forestry related acquisitions that target forested landscapes and often interfere with semisubsistence farming systems? and (ii) smaller agriculture related acquisitions that often target existing cropland and also interfere with semi subsistence systems. Furthermore, our meta analysis of land acquisition implementation processes shows that authoritarian, topdown processes dominate. Initially, the demands of powerful regional and domestic investors tend to override socioecological variables, local actors’ interests, and land governance mechanisms. As available land grows scarce, however, and local actors gain experience dealing with land acquisitions, it appears that land investments begin to fail or give way to more inclusive, bottomup investment models.;"Peter Messerli

OBL:72205;Breaking the Curse - Decentralizing Natural Resource Management in Myanmar (English);;"Summary: ""In 2008, Myanmar’s military rulers ratified a new constitution that ensured their continued monopoly of the country’s natural resources. Section 37 (a) states:
“the Union is the ultimate owner ofall lands and all natural resources above and below the ground, above and beneath the water and in the atmosphere”
Under this constitution, the central government in Naypyidaw is not only the owner of all natural resources in the country; it also controls and manages them, enacting “necessary laws for extraction.” This centralized control has had disastrous effects in widening inequality, fueling a cycle of conflict and violence, and depleting non-renewable resources that could be the basis of a sound economy for future generations.
Arakan State provides a perfect illustration of this and lies at the heart of one of Myanmar’s most sought after resources: natural gas. The Shwe project now produces 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, yet none of this is used to provide electricity in Arakan State. While local communities bear livelihood and environmental destruction, human rights abuses and land confiscation, the gas is sold to China and more than one billion USD annually flows to Naypyidaw. There, accounting of the revenues remains opaque and reinvestment in Arakan’s infrastructure, education, and health is practically non-existent. The state is the second poorest in the country
Until now, the military, the central government, and foreign investors have taken advantage of the centralized governance structure and a lack of protection mechanisms to make all the decisions around natural resources and reap most of the benefits. In contrast, devolving the powers to manage resources to lower levels of government will establish political, administrative, and fiscal structures so that decisions around the use of natural resources can be made at local levels with input from affected peoples. This distribution of powers makes natural resource management more accountable to the needs of local communities and will therefore ensure a more sustainable development.
Drawing on the Arakan Oil Watch’s decade-long work with communities affected by natural resource investments and experiences from resource-rich countries around the world, we find six critical components to achieve sustainable natural resource management in Myanmar. They are:
1. Build peace: A moratorium on high-value natural resource extraction until political agreements and new legislation have been finalized will reduce tensions and conflict and allow time for protection laws and institutions to be established. Peace
agreements that specify division of powers—such as the one in Papua New Guinea—will help prevent conflicts from re- emerging and enable subnational governments to proceed with establishing their own governance structures...
2. Broaden participation: Engaging people in the process of managing their own resources and ensuring that they receive benefits from their resources will prevent resentment and reduce conflicts. Strengthening formal participation, as is done in Latin America with community referendums, will provide immediate input from affected communities and community- based organizations on natural resource projects as well as on long-term planning decisions...
3. Decentralize governance: Transferring significant powers of authority from Naypyidaw to civilian-led state and regional governments through statutory and constitutional provisions will bring decision-making closer to affected people and make development processes more efficient and equitable.
4. Decentralize ownership of natural resources: Amending Section 37 (a) of the national constitution to enable states and regions to own their natural resources will address longstanding calls for more autonomy from ethnic organizations, contributing to long lasting peace...
5. Decentralize control and management of natural resources: Amending Section 37 (b) of the national constitution so that states and regions can control and manage their lands and natural resources, including the decision whether or not non-renewable resources should be extracted. State and regional governments will also then be able to establish appropriate laws and institutions for economic planning, regulation and monitoring of extractive industries, and rights protection for current and future generations...
6. Decentralize collection of natural resource revenues:
Providing legislative powers for states and regions to collect significant taxes will enable responsive local governments to manage their own budgets and allocate funds according to local plans and needs, reducing time consuming and costly bureaucracy at the national level, and better serving local populations.";;;Arakan Oil Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-01-2016;en;"land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72205;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Arakan_Oil_Watch-2016-02-Breaking-the-Curse-en-tpo-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:72194;Mediating forest conflicts in South East Asia: Getting the positive out of conflicts over forests and land;;"Executive summary: ""The high incidence of forest conflict in Southeast Asia underscores the need for conflict-transformation tools to maximize
the positive impacts and reduce potential damage. Mediation is considered one of the most effective approaches in
transforming conflict over natural resources. Mediation is often chosen when negotiation between conflict parties fails due
to the complexity and intensity of the conflict and because of unequal negotiating power. It is also chosen when the judicial
process is considered too complex and requires higher transaction costs.
This issues paper is based on analysis of six conflict mediation cases in three countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia
and Thailand). The study aimed to increase the understanding of how mediation has been applied in transforming forest
conflicts, including what factors led to the success and the challenges encountered. The paper also provides suggestions on
how mediation, as an approach for conflict transformation, can be strengthened in Southeast Asia.
The findings of the study indicate that mediation was crucial in transforming the six forest and land conflicts. It facilitated
the creation of an environment conducive for multi-stakeholder dialogue, built trust among conflict parties and instilled
problem-solving capacity of the conflict parties. Mediation brought out several positive outcomes for the conflict parties
beyond just the settlement of the conflict: It improved mutual understanding and respect, fostered better social relations
and long-term cooperation and increased the parties’ capacity to find sustainable solutions to conflict. The impacts from the
six cases are categorized from economic, environmental and social points of view, with the social outcomes considered the
most notable impact of the mediation experience.
The study also found that mediation can be applied in various types of forest and land conflicts that involved different actors,
issues and at varying levels of intensity. Five of the mediation cases studied involved communities in conflict with external
actors (plantation companies, mining companies and protected area authority); the sixth case involved a conflict between
communities. In terms of conflict intensity, the cases were of medium to high intensity.
The success of the mediation process in the six cases hinged, to a large extent, on the commitment, participation and trust
of all the conflict parties to the mediation as well as the skills and competence of the mediators. The achievement of the
agreements, for example, was largely possible because the mediators possessed the right skills, knowledge and personality
traits needed for mediating the conflict. In achieving their mediation objectives, those mediators worked as a team and
performed several roles, including process facilitator, communication facilitator, advisor, capacity developer and resource
provider.
Although the six cases studied followed a general mediation process, the approaches and type of mediation used varied,
depending on the dynamics and context of the conflict. There did not seem to be a one-size-fits-all approach. However, there
are principles governing the mediation process that were apparent across all the case studies, including the participatory
nature of the process, capacity development, restoration of relationships and communication.
Despite mediation’s important role in transforming conflict in the six cases, the study found that it is not a silver bullet for
all situations. Like other conflict-transformation approaches, mediation has limitations. In some cases, for example, the
results of mediation are difficult to be enforced because the decisions are not legally binding; therefore, its’ implementation
depends on the willingness of all parties to comply with the agreement. It is also not immune to the influence of internal
and external factors, such as the socio-political climate at the local or higher level. Nor can it stand alone in addressing the
root causes of a conflict; sometimes it requires policy changes. There are also a limited number of skilled mediators available
to mediate the vast number of forest and land conflicts in the region...";;;Centre for People and Forests;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2013;en;"forest land;forest conservation;local community";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72194;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/2014-Mediation_in_Southeast_Asia_issue_paper-en.pdf;;;;
OBL:72195;Reversing Land Grabs or Aggravating Tenure Insecurity? Competing Perspectives on Economic Land Concessions and Land Titling in Cambodia;;"Abstract: ""This paper discusses Cambodia’s legal framework relating to Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) and looks at the implementation gaps. It argues that despite Cambodian’s legal framework governing land and ELCs being welldeveloped, its social benefits, such as protecting the rights of the poor and vulnerable an contributing to transparency and accountability, are almost non existent. Recent evidence suggests that the Government’s handling of natural resources is a far cry from its official land policy which is “to administer, manage, use and distribute land in an equitable, transparent, efficient, and sustainable manner”. This paper argues that this is due to (1) a large gap between the country’s legal framework and the implementation of the country’s land concession policies and (2) a complete disregard of the country’s customary land rights. Widespread corruption and nepotism encourages growing inequality in land ownership and a significant power imbalance between small groups of powerful, politically and economically well-connected elites and poor and vulnerable people in Cambodia. This is exacerbated by the lack of implementation of appropriate regulations. This elite exercises control over the judiciary and has created a climate of impunity, thus hindering the overall implementation of the legal framework and serving their own interests. The paper further looks into recent Government actions such as the moratorium on ELCs and a new land titling initiative to re-allocate ELC area and forestland to the rural poor and assesses whether these actions have the potential to reverse or perpetuate the current inequality in land holdings.";"Christoph Oldenburg

this Guide is intended for the directors and staff of local, community-based organizations, national civil society organizations,
faith-based organizations, government actors, and other community land protection advocates and activists. the Guide refers
to these groups as “facilitating organizations,” and their field staff as “facilitators.”
We recommend reading the entire Guide at least once before beginning community land protection efforts. Facilitators can then
review specific sections of the Guide as they support communities to move through the process. However, because all the activities
within each “step” are inter-related, it is best to be familiar with all the land protection activities before beginning facilitation.
to support the adaptation and re-ordering of community land protection activities, this Guide has been designed to be printed as
a binder so that facilitators can easily move chapters around, or replace chapters with more updated versions that reflect emerging
learnings and strategies. to access the most recent versions of the Guide and connect with Namati, visit namati.org/communityland.";"Rachel Knight

OBL:66115;BURMA: Draft land law denies basic rights to farmers;;"A Statement by the Asian Human Rights Commission...

During the second sitting of the new semi-elected parliament in Burma this year, the
government submitted a draft land law. The government gazette published the draft on
September 16, and it is currently still before the parliament.
Burma needs a new land law. The current legislation on land, either for reasons of content
or because of institutional factors, lacks coherence. It is ineffectual in protecting the rights
of cultivators. With the rise and rise of private businesses linked to serving and former army
officers and bureaucrats, the incidence of land grabbing also is fast increasing, and is bound
to increase even more dramatically in the next few years. Although a new law would not
stop or perhaps even slow land grabbing of its own accord, one protecting cultivators' rights
and situating powers of review over land regulations and cases in the hands of the judiciary
and independent agencies could at least set some clear benchmarks against which to
measure actual practices, and establish some groundwork for minimum institutional
protections.
Unfortunately, the draft bill before parliament is not the law that Burma needs. In fact, it is
precisely the opposite of what the country needs. Rather than protecting cultivators' rights,
it undercuts them at practically every point, through a variety of provisions aimed at
enabling rather than inhibiting land grabbing. It invites takeover of land with government
authorization for the purpose of practically any activity, not merely for other forms of
cultivation. Under the draft, farmers could be evicted to make way for the construction of
polluting factories, power lines, roads and railways, pipelines, fun parks, condominiums
and whatever else government officials claim to be in ""the national interest""...";;;Asian Human Rights Commission;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-11-2011;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;land rights;land law;land tenure;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/66115;http://burmalibrary.org/docs12/AHRC-Critique_of_draft_land_law.pdf;;;;

Discussion was dominated by the question of the rights of ethnic community organisations and other rights groups.

The Land Use Scrutiny and Allocation Central Committee (LUSAC), a government body led by Vice President U Nyan Tun which is steering the policy-formulation process, promised to update the draft in keeping with the decisions taken by the forum.

“We will respectfully insert the decisions of this forum into the draft,” said committee secretary U Kyaw Kyaw Lwin, who is also a deputy minister in the President’s Office.

The forum decided to include representatives of farmers’ organisations in the National Land Use Council. The latest draft, the sixth, says the council should be chaired by the vice president and should include the relevant Union ministers and state and region chief ministers.

The draft would re-categorise ethnic ancestral land in accordance with the new land law and stop granting concessions on existing categories such as forest, farm or fallow land before completing the re-categorisation.

It would also use traditional disputes settlement practices and allow the participation of ethnic representatives in dispute-settlement procedures.

The ethnic CSOs demanded the inclusion of ethnic representatives at the decision-making level.

Government officials said the new dispute settlement mechanism should not contradict the existing judiciary system.

“The traditional dispute settlement mechanism is recognised at the community level, but when the dispute is referred to the court, the mechanism should not contradict the existing judicial system.

Much of this can be attributed to the rapid expansion of domestic and international commercial interest and investment in southeast Myanmar since the January 2012 preliminary ceasefire between the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Myanmar government. KHRG first documented this in a 2013 report entitled ‘Losing Ground’, which documented cases of land confiscation between January 2011 and November 2012. This report, ‘With only our voices, what can we do?’, is a follow up to that analysis and highlights continued issue areas while identifying newly documented trends. The present analysis assesses land confiscation according to a number of different factors, including: land use type; geographic distribution across KHRG’s seven research areas; perpetrators involved; whether or not compensation and/or consultation occurred; and the effects that confiscation had on local villagers. This report also seeks to highlight local responses to land confiscation, emphasising the agency that individuals and communities in southeast Myanmar already possess and the obstacles that they face when attempting to protect their own human rights. By focusing on local perspectives and giving priority to villagers’ voices, this report aims to provide local, national, and international actors with a resource that will allow them to base policy and programmatic decisions that will impact communities in southeast Myanmar more closely on the experiences and concerns of the people living there."".....

OBL:71565;The right to land at crossroads in Myanmar;;"Conclusion:

""Myanmar is at a historic crossroads where rapid land polarisation means that a major rethink is needed of how land and associated resources are regulated and for what purposes. The good news is that there is a lot of thinking about and rethinking of land policy happening both inside and outside the corridors of state; many people are putting serious time and energy into thinking about what should be done, and at least for the time being, the political space exists for previously excluded voices to weigh in and be heard.

Both the NLUP and the KNU Land Policy are positive examples of what can be achieved when policy making processes are opened up and public participation and consultation is encouraged. Both policies have shown how it is possible to acknowledge and take steps to address the fundamental concerns and aspirations voiced by real people, especially those who have been most harmed by past policy and law. Both policies, for example, have taken on board the aspirations of many IDPs and refugees who want to return to their places of origin, or at least be given a chance to explore if that possible and if so under what conditions. Both policies have also taken on board the need expressed by many to take steps at the policy level to guarantee respect for the right to land of all, especially the most vulnerable and marginal and including the customary land rights of ethnic nationalities. The KNU policy goes further by recognising the importance of addressing existing land inequality through land redistribution and recognising the possibility of preventing serious land inequality in the future through a land size ceiling.

The NLD does not yet have (or has not yet made public) a detailed land policy, but only its election manifesto, which has several weak points with regard to land related issues and was also not part of consultation process. Ironically, the NLUP adopted under the previous government is far closer to the VGGTs than the NLD election manifesto. Those hoping for change in a better direction will likely have to struggle on. The future remains uncertain especially for ethnic nationalities whose right to land and tenure rights are not recognised by current laws, for landless and near-landless rural working people, and for IDPs and refugees who wish to return.

Yet there may still be some time and cause for hope that in the future, the new NLD government will unveil a more detailed position (and take actions) on land that take on board these and other good points found in the NLUP and the KNU land policy. After all, solving the land problem is tied to the country’s prospects for peace. In the end, moving forward meaningfully in the peace process and on the land front will require an approach that puts state-led initiatives at the service of community-defined and community-led processes of negotiation and collective decision-making, and opening political space particularly at the ground level for those most affected to debate and negotiate amongst themselves their own visions of the future. This can only be done with real public consultation, where the actual needs and aspirations of those who have been most affected in the past and will be most affected in the future are finally heard and reflected in law and policy.";Jenny Franco;;Transnational Institute;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-07-2016;en;"land policies;land administration;land governance;land law";;Land Policy & Legislation;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71565;https://www.tni.org/en/article/the-right-to-land-at-crossroads-in-myanmar;;;;

OBL:64783;Expert cautions on ‘land grab’ model;;"A VISITING land expert has warned against falling for the “dominant model” of land grabbing, which sees small-scale farmers replaced by agri-businesses that are in many cases less productive.

Mr Robin Palmer, who has worked on land issues for more than 35 years as both an academic and for British NGO Oxfam, said last week that population pressures and the increasing consumption of meat and dairy products in developing countries were often used to justify plantation farming, with peasant farmers and traditional pastoralists dismissed as “romantic nonsense”.

“In the context of global land grabbing … this is the dominant model,” he told The Myanmar Times in Yangon on February 21. “It’s curious because land has been a source of conflict in many places yet despite that governments are giving it away.”

The indiscriminate firing of mortars and small arms in civilian areas by armed groups involved in the conflict, and conflict related abuse including an explicit threat by Tatmadaw forces to burn civilians' homes, caused at least 143 villagers from Gkyaw Hta, Khoh Htoh, T'Aye Shay and Mae Naw Ah villages to seek refuge in the Ra--- area of Thailand between April 22nd and 30th 2011.

OBL:64789;Acute food shortages threatening 8,885 villagers in 118 villages across northern Papun District;;At least 8,885 villagers in 118 villages in Lu Thaw Township, Papun District have either exhausted their current food supplies or are expecting to do so prior to the October 2011 harvest. The 118 villages are located in nine village tracts, where attacks on civilians by Burma's state army, the Tatmadaw, have triggered wide scale and repeated displacement since 1997. As tens of thousands of civilians in northern Karen State have been displaced, over-population in hiding areas where civilians can more effectively avoid attacks has created shortages of arable land, depleted soil fertility and reduced potential crop yields. Civilians forced to cultivate land or live near Tatmadaw camps, meanwhile, have faced recent attacks, including indiscriminate shelling and attacks on food supplies, buildings and livelihoods. These existing obstacles to food security were compounded by an unusually dry rainy season in 2010, coupled with other environmental factors, causing the 2010 harvest to fail. The impact of acute food shortages on the civilian population is magnified by budgetary constraints of local relief organisations, which can access the affected area but are currently unable to provide emergency assistance to many of those facing food shortages. This regional report is based on research conducted by KHRG researchers in Lu Thaw Township in February and March 2011, including 41 interviews with villagers and village and village tract leaders in the affected areas. This research was augmented by interviews with members of local relief organisations in February, March and April 2011.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;11-05-2011;en;"local community;food security;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64789;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/KHRG-2011-05-11-Acute_food_shortages_threatening_8885_villagers_in_118_villages_across_northern_Papun_District-en.pdf;;;;

the government of India, is planning to build a giant
hydroelectric dam near Tamanthi on the Chindwin River
in northwest Burma’s Sagaing Division. The dam’s fl ood
reservoir will be almost 1,400 sq km, the size of Delhi, and
will permanently displace over 45,000 people, including
the entire town of Khamti. Already over 2,400 people have
been relocated at gunpoint from the dam site, without fair
compensation.
The Tamanthi dam will adversely affect the biodiversity
and ecological balance of the entire Chindwin River, which,
as the largest tributary of the Irrawaddy, acts as a major
watershed for the whole country. Although the dam will
bring about massive changes to the Chindwin, the entire
dam building process has been shrouded in secrecy, and
there has been a complete lack of public participation in
decision making.

Chindwin for generations, and are determined to protect
the river from this destructive project. We therefore urge

OBL:56636;Holding Our Ground: Land Confiscation in Arakan & Mon States, and Pa-O Area of Southern Shan State;;"Introduction: ""The following report has been compiled to bring to the attention of a wider
audience many of the problems facing the people of Burma, especially its many
ethnic nationalities. For many outside observers, Burma’s problems are confined
simply to the ongoing incarceration of Nobel Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,
the country’s democratically elected leader, and many other political prisoners.
However, as we hope to show in the following report, this is only one of very
many human rights abuses that provide obstacles to the people’s hope for
democracy.
This report concentrates in 3 specific areas of the country – Arakan State, Mon
State and the Pa-O Area of southern Shan State. This is partly due to budget and
time constraints, but, primarily because the brutal treatment received by the
people of these areas at the hands of the military junta has received limited media
attention in the past.""...Conclusion: ""The SPDC’s ongoing dual policy of increasing militarization and forced land
confiscation, both to house and feed the increasing troop numbers, causes
widespread problems throughout Burma. By robbing people of the land from
which many make their livings, without any or providing only desultory
compensation, many citizens face drastic problems such as food and water
shortages, an inability to educate their children and an inability to find work.
Additionally, the policy of using forced labour in the Government’s construction
and development projects, coupled with the disastrous environmental effects of
many of these projects, continues to create severe health problems throughout
the country. All of this often leads to people fleeing the country in search of a
better life.";;;All Arakan Students’ and Youths’ Congress (AASYC), Pa-O Youth Organisation (PYO) and Mon Youth Progressive Organisation (MYPO);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;28-02-2009;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing;land rights";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/56636;http://burmalibrary.org/docs07/HOLDING_OUR_GROUND%28en%29.pdf;;;;

OBL:48377;Fear and Hope: Displaced Burmese Women in Burma and Thailand;;"Executive Summary:
""The impact of decades of military repression on
the population of Burma has been devastating.
Hundreds of thousands of Burmese have been
displaced by the government?s suppression of
ethnic insurgencies and of the pro-democracy
movement. As government spending has concentrated
on military expenditures to maintain its
control, the once-vibrant Burmese economy has
been virtually destroyed. Funding for health and
education is negligible, leaving the population at
the mercy of the growing AIDS epidemic, which
is itself fueled by the production, trade and intravenous
use of heroin, as well as the trafficking of
women.
The Burmese people, whether displaced by government
design or by economic necessity, whether
opposed to the military regime or merely trying to
survive in a climate of fear, face enormous challenges.
Human rights abuses are legion. The government?s
strategies of forced labor and relocation
destroy communities. Displacement, disruption of
social networks and the collapse of the public
health systems provide momentum for the spreading
AIDS epidemic?which the government has
barely begun to acknowledge or address. The
broader crisis in health care in general and reproductive
health in particular affects women at all
levels; maternal mortality is extremely high, family
planning is discouraged. The decay?and willful
destruction?of the educational system has created
an increasingly illiterate population?without the
tools necessary to participate in a modern society.
The country-wide economic crisis drives the
growth of the commercial sex industry, both in
Burma and in Thailand.
Yet, international pressure for political change is
increasing and nongovernmental organizations and
some UN agencies manage to work within Burma,
quietly challenging the status quo. The delegation
met with Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary of
the National League for Democracy, who is considered
by much of the international community as
the true representative of the Burmese people.
Despite her concerns that humanitarian aid can
prop up the SPDC, she was cautiously supportive
of direct, transparent assistance in conjunction
with unrelenting international condemnation of
the military government?s human rights abuses and
anti-democratic rule.
The delegation concluded that carefully designed
humanitarian assistance in Burma can help people
without strengthening the military government.
And, until democracy is restored in Burma,
refugees in Thailand must receive protection from
forced repatriation, and be offered opportunities
for skills development and education to carry
home. On both sides of the border, women?s
groups work to respond to the issues facing their
communities; they are a critical resource in
addressing the critical needs for education, reproductive
health and income generation.""

BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MYANMAR-CHINA...
OVERLAND TIMBER TRADE...
EIA INVESTIGATIONS...
CHINA’S ROLE.....""For at least two decades,
timber extracted from Myanmar’s precious frontier forests
in highly destructive logging operations has been flowing
into China unhindered. It is an illicit business worth hundreds
of millions of dollars a year, making it one of the single
largest bilateral flows of illegal timber in the world.
From the outside looking in, the cross-border trade
appears chaotic and complex. Most of the timber entering
Yunnan is either cut or transported through Kachin State,
a zone of conflict between ethnic political groups and the
Myanmar Government and its military. Here, all sides to
varying degrees profit from the logging and timber trade,
from the award of rights to Chinese businesses to log
whole mountains, often paid in gold bars, to levying fees
at multiple checkpoints to allow trucks carrying logs to
pass. While Kachin and Yunnan lie at the heart of trade,
it reaches far wider. Logs shipped across the border are
increasingly sourced from further inside Myanmar, such
as Sagaing Division, and end up supplying factories in
south and east China.
Yet field research conducted by the Environmental
Investigation Agency (EIA) reveals that beneath the
apparent chaos lies an intricate and structured supply
chain within which different players have a defined function
and collude to ensure the logs keep flowing. Key nodes in
the chain involve well-connected intermediaries who secure
logging rights for resale, cooperative groups of business
people who monopolise the trade at certain crossing points,
and logistics companies on the China side of the border
which effectively legalise the timber by clearing it through
customs and paying tax.
The peak year for the illicit trade was 2005, when one
million cubic metres (m3) of logs crossed the border.
A brief hiatus occurred for a few years afterwards when
Chinese authorities clamped down on the trade. But it
proved to be short-lived and the scale of the business is
once again approaching the peak levels. This trade is illegal
under Myanmar law, which mandates that all wood should
exit the country via Yangon port, and contravenes the
country’s log export ban. It also goes against the stated
policy of the Chinese Government to respect the forestry
laws of other countries and oppose illegal logging.
It is time for both countries to take urgent effective action
against the massive illicit timber trade across their joint
border. The 155 Chinese loggers have now returned home,
but without action to end the trade others will take their
place and further conflict, violence and forest destruction
will occur...";;;Environmental Investigation Agency;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;17-09-2015;en;deforestation;"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/100670;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/EIA-2015-09-Organised_Chaos.pdf;;;;

OBL:74896;Save The Madae Island - English & Burmese (video);;"On remote Madae Island on Myanmar’s western coast, the Chinese state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is constructing a huge seaport, oil terminal and oil and gas pipeline to China for shipping more than 80% of China’s imported oil from the Middle East and Africa without people’s consent, and without implementation of EIA, SIA and FPIC. The construction of these projects has resulted in human rights abuses, massive land confiscation, environmental destruction and destruction of the islanders’ livelihoods and farmlands. Islanders are living in fear of an accident or explosion resulting from the oil terminal, oil and gas pipeline and China’s oil tankers which plan to dock in this area in 2015. 
Madae Island is a small island located in the Kyauk Phyu township of Arakan State, on the West coast of Myanmar. The island has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for centuries. Over 800 households and 3000 people live in four villages on Madae Island, mostly consisting of fishermen and farmers.
CNPC’s projects on Madae Island is not benefiting local Madae islanders, Arakan State or the rest of the people in Myanmar.

OBL:46080;FMO Research Guide: Burma;;"Historically underdeveloped and divided, Burma today is politically isolated, increasingly militarised, economically mismanaged by its own authorities, and socially and culturally divided along ethnic, religious, and language lines. Following independence from Britain in 1948, parties representing the ethnic minority population have been struggling for greater autonomy from the central Burmese regime. Following nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) staged a coup to take over the governing of Burma, reinstating martial law and imposing restrictions on opposition to the government. Thousands of people were killed during this uprising. Elections held in 1990 whereby the National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide victory have never been honoured.

The contemporary military regime does not allow access to the country for research purposes, and therefore research on displacement is largely carried out by interviewing people fleeing the country. However, consistent accounts of human rights violations are available over a number of years. Displacement in Burma results mostly from systematic patterns of human rights abuses associated with militarisation and conflict in ethnic minority areas. Human rights violations, carried out with impunity, include numerous acts of arbitrary executions, killings, torture, rape, forced labour, forced relocation, use of child soldiers, and violations of religious freedoms. These have been documented over the years and have increased in intensity since 1988. Muslims and Christians are often persecuted directly because of their minority status.

Recent development efforts to encourage tourism have led to forced labour and further displacement. It has been reported that the islands off the coast of Burma being developed for tourism have had their populations relocated under conditions of extreme brutality, including killings. There are refugees from Burma in Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and China. It is also thought that the Lao PDR has refugees from Burma, but nothing is known about this population.

OBL:43581;INDUSTRIAL ESTATES IN MYANMAR: 1995 – 2005;;"This compendium focuses on recent articles related to the development of industrial estates in the major urban centres of Myanmar. Although the clustering of traditional craft industries was common in towns and cities throughout Burma in the colonial era, it was not until the 1950s that modern industrial complexes such as those in the Pyay district of central Burma and in several parts of Rangoon began to take shape. The displacement of urban core residents and small enterprises that took place in the late fifties also led to the development of industrial sites in satellite towns on the east side of the capital. But it was only in the 1990s, following the opening to privately owned industries by Burma’s military government, that the push to develop industrial zones throughout the country began in earnest. 

 

Today there are more than fifty industrial parks scattered throughout the country, about half of them in the area around the national capital. Some, like the new complexes at Indagaw near Bago and the two near Kyaukse in Upper Myanmar are exclusively reserved for state-owned factories. Others are being developed with foreign capital for foreign-owned enterprises or foreign companies that have entered into joint-venture agreements with holding companies of the military government. Most of the new industrial estates are being developed by the Department of Human Settlement and Housing Development of the Ministry of Construction specifically for privately owned industries. Over 6,000 of the 50,000 privately owned manufacturing enterprises in the country are now accommodated in these zones. Recently, several privately owned land development companies have begun their own industrial parks in the Yangon area in collaboration with the DHSHD. 

 

The articles in the compendium are arranged in chronological order with the most recently published at the top of the list. 

 

The articles have been selected on the basis that they are representative of initiatives and challenges faced in the rapidly developing industrial zones of Myanmar. Internet search engines such as Google will yield many more references on any one of the many zones named here. Researchers should bear in mind that place names in Myanmar are frequently spelled in a variety of ways in English. Thus, the use of different spellings as search words may result in a considerable increase in the amount of information generated.";;;Courier Information Services;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;;en;"urban population;displacement;urban areas";"Land Conflicts;Urban Tenure";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/43581;http://burmalibrary.org/docs2/INDUSTRIAL%20ESTATES%20IN%20MYANMAR.pdf;;;;

OBL:98575;Resource Federalism - a roadmap for decentralised governance of Burma’s natural heritage;;"While Burma’s ethnic states are blessed with a wealth of natural resources and biodiversity, they 
have been cursed by the unsustainable extraction and sale of those resources, which has fuelled 
armed conflict. Instituting a system of devolved federal management of natural resources can 
play a key role in resolving conflict and building a lasting peace in Burma.
Despite some ceasefires on paper, Burma remains in a state of conflict. Ongoing offensives in 
Kachin and Shan states alone have left hundreds of thousands homeless. Fundamental calls for 
self-determination have gone unheeded in a lack of political dialogue to end decades of fighting.
Military offensives into resource-rich ethnic areas have expanded Burma Army presence in plac
-
es previously controlled by de-facto ethnic governments. This has facilitated the rapid increase 
in the extraction and sale of natural resources in recent years. Resource projects have collected 
huge revenues for the army and the central government, but have not benefited local populations. 
Constitutional powers place natural resource ownership, control, and management fully in the 
hands of the central government. This report analyzes six key natural resources: forests, land, 
water, minerals, gems, and oil and gas. In each sector, a series of laws and practices prevent 
affected peoples from having a say in their own development: they cannot assess, provide input 
into, or censure the management of their natural resources. Ethnic women, particularly in rural 
areas, are doubly marginalized from natural resource governance. 
Centralised resource control is fanning the flames of discontent and anger
. Resource projects are 
causing environmental destruction, human rights abuses, and loss of livelihoods, with unique 
impacts on women. Extracting and exporting raw, often non-renewable, resources is further 
inflicting an incalculable liability on future generations. Resources used to produce ener
gy are 
consistently prioritised for export, contributing to the development of neighboring countries 
while resource-rich areas remain in the dark. 
People from across the country have staged protests and demonstrations, calling for an end to 
destructive resource exploitation and for constitutional rights to own, control, and manage their 
own resources. Ethnic political parties and armed groups are standing with the people in these 
demands. Devolved decision-making offers stronger accountability and representation at all 
levels of government, an opportunity for local input and control, benefits to local populations, 
and environmental sustainability. 
Burma does not need to start from zero in developing devolved governance structures. Local 
communities have managed lands, water, and forests with sustainable customary practices for 
generations, and de-facto governments have supported such practices with formal structures and laws...";;;Burma Environmental Working Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;24-10-2017;en;"land policies;expropriation;land governance;land law;land grabbing;environment;extractive industries;security of tenure (land);forest land;land tenure systems";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/98575;http://burmalibrary.org/docs23/BEWG-2017-ResourceFederalism-en-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:74524;LINKING WOMEN AND LAND IN MYANMAR - RECOGNISING GENDER IN THE NATIONAL LAND USE POLICY;;"Introduction:
""The draft National Land Use Policy (NLUP) that was unveiled for public comment in October 2014 intends to create a clear national framework for managing land in Myanmar1. This is a very important step for Myanmar, given the fundamental importance of land policy for any society – particularly those with recent and complex histories of political and armed conflict and protracted displaced populations. With 70% of Myanmar’s population living and working in rural areas, agriculture is a fundamental part of the country’s social and economic fabric. The majority of these are small-holder farmers, whose land rights are currently under threat. The situation is particularly dire for the country’s ethnic minority groups, who make up an estimated 30% of the population.
Establishing an inclusive land use policy-making process that allows for - and encourages - full and meaningful participation for all rural working people is essential for ensuring a policy outcome that is widely and effectively accepted by society.
The land use policy draft under discussion here has a national scope, and will likely have a long-term impact. Therefore it is of crucial importance to the future prospects and trajectories of agriculture and the lives of those engaged in the sector, with impacts not only upon how land is used, but also upon who will use it, under what conditions, for how long and with what purposes. Ensuring that all members of Myanmar’s rural communities are considered in the making of the policy, so that their needs are represented and their rights are upheld, is critical to its legitimacy and efficacy in providing a basis for democratic access and control over land and associated resources.
This policy brief will focus upon the potential gender implications of the current policy draft and offer some suggestions as to how it might be improved to promote and strengthen women’s land rights within the Myanmar context...";;;Transnational Institute;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-01-2015;en;"land policies;land administration;land governance;land law";;Land Policy & Legislation;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74524;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/TNI-2015-02-Women%26land-en.pdf;;;;

OBL:74520;Disputed Territory - Mon farmers fight against unjust land acquisition and barriers to their progress;;"Over the years HURFOM has produced a number of accounts highlighting the
hardships faced by Mon farmers who became victims of land confiscation or
unjust land acquisition.1 In this report HURFOM follows-up on previously
documented abuses and concentrates on an emerging new trend: farmers’ active and
collective pursuits for rights to their land.
Disputed Territory aims to elaborate on the activities of and express solidarity with
farmers who are resolutely, and in some cases for the first time, seeking justice
regarding their land. To exhibit current challenges and bring into focus some of the key
obstacles in the Mon context, this report uses case studies of appeals over past military
land confiscations in Ye Township and on-going transgressions by various investors in
Kyaikmayaw Township. Where barriers to justice exist, HURFOM recommends effective
and immediate solutions.
HURFOM contends that farmers’ newly voiced demands present an important
opportunity for President Thein Sein’s government. Inherent in an environment of
growing activism is the chance to meet appeals with justice, thereby demonstrating to
domestic and international critics that the administration is committed to a clear break
with the abuses of past military regimes. Violations of farmers’ rights need to be publicly
condemned and owners of wrongfully seized land must have property restored or be
given fair compensation. There is an urgent need for the establishment of a credible
legal framework to prevent dispossession and violated rights from continuing to be

""The evidence submitted in this report covers two main issues: 1) the circumstances and validity of contracts signed by local villagers in April 2011 to allow their farmlands to be used by a copper mining joint venture between Wanbao, a Chinese military-owned company, and U Paing, a Burmese military-owned company, and 2) the circumstances and validity of the police action used to disperse peaceful protesters at the copper mine site during the early morning hours of 29 November, 2013.
This submission presents relevant laws and facts concerning the Letpadaung case; it does not draw legal conclusions or make specific policy recommendations.
The evidence indicates that local government authorities, acting on behalf of the joint venture companies, used fraudulent means to coerce villagers to sign contracts against their will, and then refused to allow villagers and monks to exercise their constitutional right to peaceful assembly and protest.
The evidence also indicates that police used military-issue white-phosphorus (WP) grenades (misleadingly termed smoke bombs) combined with water cannons to destroy the protest camps and injure well over 100 monks with severe, deep chemical burns.

OBL:74324;Commercial Agriculture Expansion in Myanmar: Links to Deforestation, Conversion Timber, and Land Conflicts;;"In Myanmar, as in other countries of the Mekong, it is widely acknowledged that the clearing of forests to
make way for the expansion of commercial agricultural fields is increasingly the leading driver of deforestation,
alongside legal and illegal logging, and the clearance of forest areas to make way for infrastructure projects
such as roads and hydropower dams. While the conversion of forests for agricultural development has been
occurring for many decades, it is the unprecedented rate of this conversion that is now so astounding — as
well as the fact that the government is encouraging increasing levels of investment for large-scale industrial
agricultural expansion when laws and institutions are not yet able to regulate these large-scale land acquisitions
(LSLAs). National legal frameworks — laws, regulations, and enforcement bodies — will need to be improved
so this development occurs in the context of sustainable and legal forest management and local communities
are assured that they have secure land use rights and access to these agricultural and forested landscapes for
their livelihood needs.
Despite national statements purporting to protect Myanmar’s remaining forests, a new set of land and investment
laws1 are still facilitating the conversion of forests into private agribusiness concessions. Since Myanmar’s President
U Thein Sein took office in March 2011, the new reform-minded government has promoted industrial agricultural
development as an attractive sector for both domestic and, increasingly, foreign investment. In the forest sector
itself, promising new reforms have been progressing, but so far have focused only on the managed timber estates
under the direct control of the Myanmar Forest Department (which have been over-harvested for decades). The
remaining natural forests in the country’s resource-rich, ethnic-populated states are still left outside any effective
forest management and are thus even more prone to extensive logging and forest conversion. In sum, each year Myanmar has been losing more than 1.15 million acres of forests — some of Southeast
Asia’s last remaining (sub-)tropical High Conservation Value Forests (HCVF). Hardwood log exports have been
growing by volume, and even more by value, since the new government took office (Figures 1 and 2). Between
2011 and 2013, the volume of timber product exports jumped from about 2.7 to over 3.3 million m3, with
values increasing from just over US$ 1 billion to about US$ 1.6 billion. Much of Myanmar’s timber is no longer
sourced from historical (over-cut) harvesting areas (government-managed timber estates predominately in
the geographic center of the country). Instead, domestic private companies are clear-cutting HCVFs — for
agribusiness, mining, and hydropower sites, and special economic zones (SEZs) — and producing Myanmar’s, and some of the world’s, most valuable “conversion timber.” Forest Trends has estimated that conversion
timber from these LSLAs now constitutes a significant portion of the Burmese timber being placed on the
international market...";Kevin Woods;;Forest Trends;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;28-02-2015;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing;deforestation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74324;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Forest_Trends-2015-03-Conversion_Timber_in_Myanmar-en.pdf;;;;

OBL:62356;Progress stops at the Myanmar elite's door;;"Freedom of speech will struggle to flourish in Myanmar as its economic interests are dominated by powerful neighbours...The protesters were given five minutes to leave. Police surrounded their camp close to the Letpadaung copper mine in northern Myanmar in the early hours of Thursday, armed with loudspeakers, water cannons and warnings of attack. First came the water, the force of which swept away dozens of flimsy structures used to shelter hundreds of Myanmarese angered at the damage wrought over more than a decade by the country's largest copper mine.

What came next however struck fear into the heart of Myanmar's nascent environmental movement. Plumes of fire lit up the night sky as police and riot control units shot incendiary bombs into the clusters of tents. ""They fired 10 rounds; five at a time,"" one protester told the Democratic Voice of Burma. ""And the sparks that landed on people's clothing couldn't be shaken off; they burst into flames when they attempted to do so.""

Images that emerged following the crackdown showed hospital wards filled with burn victims - men, women and Buddhist monks. ""I'd prefer to be dead now than suffering [from the burns] - the pain is too unbearable,"" a monk said.

The brutality of the incident conjures memories of September 2007, when hundreds of pro-democracy protesters were shot dead by Myanmar troops. That crackdown was congruent with the reputation of the military junta that ruled Myanmar at the time.

But 18 months into its experiment with democracy and wildly contradicting the progressive rhetoric of President Thein Sein, the attack last week has left many questioning the earnestness of the reforms. Moreover, the involvement of police, who operate under the auspices of the president, has cast a shadow over a leader preparing to accept a number of top peace awards.

The Letpadaung incident goes beyond a simple bid to stifle dissent. While environmental damage and grievances over the confiscation of 7,800 acres of land were the key focus of the resistance to the mine, in the government's eye, these protests marked the intersection at which three hugely sensitive issues meet: The public's ability to exercise freedom of speech, China's influence over Myanmar and vested military interests in the country's natural resources. 

Put together, they indicate that at the core of government, there still exists the same fear over the standing of the elite that fuelled abuses by Myanmar's former rulers.

Days into the protests, Aung Min, one of President Thein Sein's top cabinet members, was caught on camera saying that the mine would stay open because, ""We are afraid of China""...";FRANCIS WADE;;Al Jazeera;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;04-12-2012;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62356;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/12/201212484532708930.html;;;;
OBL:58907;The role of coercive measures in forced migration/internal displacement in Burma/Myanmar;;"Conclusion: ""Most relevant reports and surveys I have been able to access state essentially that people from all parts of Burma leave home either in obedience to a direct relocation order from the military or civil authorities or as a result of a process whereby coercive measures imposed by the authorities play a major role in forcing down household incomes to the point where the family cannot survive. At this point, leaving home may seem to be the only option. These factors, which include direct forced relocation, forced labour, extortion and land confiscation, operate in, are affected by and exacerbate a situation of widespread poverty, rising inflation and declining real incomes. In other words, people leave home due to a combination of coercive and economic factors. One has to consider the whole process leading to displacement rather than a single, immediate cause. Where coercive measures, as described in this article, are involved, the resulting population movement falls under the Guiding Principles even if the situation that actually triggers movement, frequently food insecurity, may also be described in economic terms.";Andrew Bosson;;Andrew Bosson;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;17-03-2008;en;"land policies;food security;expropriation;farming systems;land governance;dispossession;land grabbing;displacement;research;farmland";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/58907;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/IDPs-Coercive-measures2008-03-17.pdf;;;;
OBL:62595;2012 Global Hunger Index;;"The Challenge of hunger: ensuring sustainable food security under land, water and energy stresses...""World hunger, according to the 2012 Global Hunger Index (GHI), has 
declined somewhat since 1990 but remains “serious.” The global 
average masks dramatic differences among regions and countries. 
Regionally, the highest GHI scores are in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. South Asia reduced its GHI score significantly between 
1990 and 1996—mainly by reducing the share of underweight children—but could not maintain this rapid progress. Though Sub-Saharan Africa made less progress than South Asia in the 1990s, it has 
caught up since the turn of the millennium, with its 2012 GHI score 
falling below that of South Asia.
From the 1990 GHI to the 2012 GHI, 15 countries reduced 
their scores by 50 percent or more. In terms of absolute progress, 
between the 1990 GHI and the 2012 GHI, Angola, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nicaragua, Niger, and Vietnam saw the largest improvements in their scores.
Twenty countries still have levels of hunger that are “extremely 
alarming” or “alarming.” Most of the countries with alarming GHI scores 
are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (the 2012 GHI does not, 
however, reflect the recent crisis in the Horn of Africa, which intensified in 2011, or the uncertain food situation in the Sahel). Two of the 
three countries with extremely alarming 2012 GHI scores—Burundi 
and Eritrea—are in Sub-Saharan Africa; the third country with an 
extremely alarming score is Haiti. Its GHI score fell by about one quarter from 1990 to 2001, but most of this improvement was reversed in 
subsequent years. The devastating January 2010 earthquake, although 
not yet fully captured by the 2012 GHI because of insufficient availability of recent data, pushed Haiti back into the category of “extremely alarming.” In contrast to recent years, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo is not listed as “extremely alarming,” because insufficient data 
are available to calculate the country’s GHI score. Current and reliable 
data are urgently needed to appraise the situation in the country.
Recent developments in the land, water, and energy sectors 
have been wake-up calls for global food security: the stark reality is 
that the world needs to produce more food with fewer resources, while 
eliminating wasteful practices and policies. Demographic changes, 
income increases, climate change, and poor policies and institutions 
are driving natural resource scarcity in ways that threaten food production and the environment on which it depends. Food security is now 
inextricably linked to developments in the water, energy, and land sectors. Rising energy prices affect farmers’ costs for fuel and fertilizer, 
increase demand for biofuel crops relative to food crops, and raise the 
price of water use. Agriculture already occurs within a context of land 
scarcity in terms of both quantity and quality: the world’s best arable 
land is already under cultivation, and unsustainable agricultural practices have led to significant land degradation. The scarcity of farmland 
coupled with shortsighted bioenergy policies has led to major foreign 
summary 
investments in land in a number of developing countries, putting local 
people’s land rights at risk. In addition, water is scarce and likely to 
become scarcer with climate change.
To halt this trend, more holistic strategies are needed for dealing with land, water, energy, and food, and they are needed soon. To 
manage natural resources sustainably, it is important to secure land 
and water rights; phase out inefficient subsidies on water, energy, and 
fertilizers; and create a macroeconomic environment that promotes 
efficient use of natural resources. It is important to scale up technical solutions, particularly those that conserve natural resources and 
foster more efficient and effective use of land, energy, and water along 
the value chain. It is also crucial to tame the drivers of natural 
resource scarcity by, for example, addressing demographic change, 
women’s access to education, and reproductive health; raising 
incomes and lowering inequality; and mitigating and adapting to climate change through agriculture.
Food security under land, water, and energy stress poses daunting challenges. The policy steps described in this report show how we 
can meet these challenges in a sustainable and affordable way.";;;International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Concern Worldwide, Welthungerhilfe and Green Scenery:;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2012;en;"food security;land governance;land grabbing;land tenure;forestry;land rights;land tenure systems";"Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"001;MMR";Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62595;http://burmalibrary.org/docs14/ghi12-op60-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:62592;Report on the Human Rights Situation in Burma (April-September 2012);;"Introduction:
""Over the period of this report, the political landscape in Burma has undergone noticeable shifts. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, once a political prisoner under house arrest, recently returned from a whirlwind tour of the United States where she received the Congressional Gold Medal, America’s highest civilian honour. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the U.S. Congress touted her cooperation with Burmese President Thein Sein, who visited the United Nations in New York City. The trip, at the urging of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, also resulted in the further easing of sanctions on the Burmese government, including an end to the crippling ban on imports.
Simultaneously, human rights violations persist throughout the country. Deadly civil war in ethnic areas, forced labour, child soldiers, torture and ill treatment remain grave concerns. Additionally, this report will emphasize the rampant land confiscation and forced relocation by the Burmese government. Recent events, including the arrests and beatings of farmers protesting the forced relocation of landowners from 66 villages for the Latpadaung copper mine,1 underline the on-going human rights violations by the Burmese government. In its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Asian Human Rights Commission found that land grabbing is a direct result of “the convergence of the military, government agents
and business”. The report cited the rising issue of former military
personnel transitioning to new roles in industry. This marriage of
military and industry has led to human rights violations such as the
confiscation of 7,800 acres of land and untold environmental damage
for the copper mine. The mining project is being completed by the
military-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, in conjunction
with a Chinese corporation. The effects of land confiscation have real implications on the
livelihoods of civilians. A report by the Asian Legal Resource Centre
(ALRC) noted that, “Almost daily, news media carry reports of people
being forced out of their houses or losing agricultural land to statebacked
projects, sometimes being offered paltry compensation, sometimes
nothing"". The 2012 Farmland Law presented an opportunity to
address land grabbing but, according the ALRC, “far from reducing
the prospects of land grabbing, the Farmland Law opens the door to
confiscation of agricultural land on any pretext associated with a state
project or the ‘national interest&#039";;;ND-Burma;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-11-2012;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62592;http://burmalibrary.org/docs14/nd_burma-2012-09.pdf;;;;

OBL:63516;Forest cover change patterns in Myanmar (Burma) 1990•2000;;"SUMMARY:
""Myanmar is one of the most forested countries in
mainland South-east Asia. These forests support a
large number of important species and endemics and
have great value for global efforts in biodiversity
conservation. Landsat satellite imagery from the
1990s and 2000s was used to develop a countrywide
forest map and estimate deforestation. The country
has retained much of its forest cover, but forests
have declined by 0.3% annually. Deforestation varied
considerably among administrative units, with central
and more populated states and divisions showing
the highest losses. Ten deforestation hotspots had
annual deforestation rates well above the countrywide
average. Major reasons for forest losses in these
hotspots stemmed from increased agricultural conversion,
fuelwood consumption, charcoal production,
commercial logging and plantation development.
While Myanmar continues to be a stronghold for
closed canopy forests, several areas have been
experiencing serious deforestation. Most notable are
the mangrove forests in the Ayeyarwady delta region
and the remaining dry forests at the northern edge of
the central dry zone.""...

OBL:48279;An Overview of the recognition of Native Title in the Commonwealth of Australia;;"..Rights to land in Burma are bound up with issues of ethnic conflict, militarisation and lack of democratic institutions.
A future democratic Burma will need to seek ways to resolve competing claims to land, taking into account such issues
as traditional ownership by particular ethnic nationalities, return of displaced persons, varying religious ties to land,
development imperatives and agricultural demands. The chosen method of resolution will need to address, as much as
possible, the needs for certainty, efficiency and a fair hearing for those concerned.

The democratic opposition and its international supporters are seeking to explore and collect ideas for the
construction of effective and fair ways of dealing with the many complex legal and social issues in Burma. As part of
this exploration of ideas for the future, Burma Lawyers' Council encourages articles explaining relevant issues in other
countries. The following article is kindly provided by the principle legal officer of an indigenous land council in

Under the Boot, a new report by Palaung researchers, details the implementation of the Shweli Dam project, China's first Build-Operate-Transfer hydropower deal with Burma's junta. 

Since 2000, the Palaung village of Man Tat, the site of the 600 megawatt dam project, has been overrun by hundreds of Burmese troops and Chinese construction workers. Villagers have been suffering land confiscation, forced labour, and restriction on movement ever since, and a five kilometer diversion tunnel has been blasted through the hill on which the village is situated.

OBL:59166;Energy Security in Asia: China, India, Oil and Peace;;"Report to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs...""India and China are both characterized by a tremendous increase in energy
consumption, of which an increasing share derives from imports. Very rapid
economic growth always makes it difficult to arrive at a sound balance between
demand and supply, and this tends to generate waste, bottlenecks and insecurity.
Although both countries are trying hard to provide appropriate energy, increase their
energy efficiency, and diversify their sources of supply, they are becoming
increasingly dependent on imported oil, and the Persian Gulf is set to remain their
predominant source of oil in the coming decades. Instability in the Middle East thus
poses a serious challenge to the security of China and India, just as it does for Japan,
the US and many European countries. The question of maintaining a stable supply of
fossil fuels poses several security challenges. One is to boost one's own production,
another to diversify one's sources of import, and a third to secure the transportation of
oil and gas on vulnerable sea routes; or over land through pipelines that depend on
long-term strategic relationships with the producing countries.
In China and India a heightened awareness of the geopolitical implications of energy
supply and demand has given energy issues an increasing prominence both in their
domestic and foreign policies. However, it is difficult to say if this leads to more
tension in their foreign relations or if instead it pushes them towards increased
international cooperation. Plans are certainly being made for future possible â€˜resource
wars', but emphasis is presently being put on economic competition, and on seeking
to maximise each country's position on the international energy market. Then again,
such increasing resource competition may contribute to raising the stakes of conflict
in areas where national jurisdiction has not been resolved (East China Sea, South
China Sea), and also in some of the energy exporting countries. Burma is one such
country, in which the energy security dynamics of India and China are played out, and
this is detailed in an appendix to the report.
The report is based on available literature, online energy data, and communication
with Indian and Chinese researchers. We have used country reports and statistics
provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA), statistics, forecasts and analyses
by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), unpublished academic papers,
books and articles by Indian and Chinese researchers, and reports by several European
and American analysts.
Based on our assessments of the energy security strategies and interests of the major
players in the region, the report outlines three scenarios for the future of international
relations in Asia. The first, called ' is the most positive and also,
in our judgment, the most likely. The second scenario, ',
presents a possible embargo against China, and is perhaps the least likely, at least in
the near future. The third scenario, ' presents the nightmare
scenario of a full scale ' with global impact and serious consequences
for India and China. The situation in Iraq, and especially the ongoing developments with relation to Iran's nuclear programme, force us to say that this scenario is not just
a fantasy fiction, but a real possibility, even in the short term.
The final section of the report offers suggestions as to implications of the outlined
scenarios for Norwegian foreign policy formulation. Four areas of cooperation that
would improve energy security in China and India, as well as globally, are identified:
1) support for the promotion of energy efficiency,
2) assistance in the development of clean coal and gas technology for electricity
production,
3) a campaign for engaging the world's great powers in a major research effort to
develop transportation technologies that do not depend on oil,
4) assistance in the nomination and promotion of Indian and Chinese candidature
for IEA membership...";"Stein TÃ¸nnesson

UPDATE 19 SEPTEMBER 2017

""The ICBL/Landmine Monitor has verified that recent mine victims were from newly laid mines.

On 28 of August, humanitarian workers providing relief to refugees camped on the Zero line of the border witnessed an Army truck arrive on the Myanmar side and unload three boxes from which soldiers took mines and placed in the ground. This continued on that day from 10am until 3pm. The mines were laid commencing in Taung Pyo Let Yar village tract of Maungdaw Township, which is adjacent to border pillar No. 31 in Bangladesh. This area demarcates the beginning of the land border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as south of this area the border follows the Naf River.New mine use was witnessed along about a 20km stretch of the shared border between Burma and Banladesh. This stretch lies between the two main land crossing routes between Burma (Maungdaw township) and Bangladesh (Bandarban District). Subsequent to the daytime landmine operation, the Burmese Army brought trucks at night to continue laying mines, which could be seen under the lights by which they worked. Mine laying continued during the next few days, and was witnessed progressing along the border to the northeast in Mee Taik, Nga Yant Chaung, Hlaing Thi, Bauk Shu Hpweit and In Tu Lar townships. Mine laying was last seen continuing to the east of In Tu Lar township.

OBL:62552;Beyond Tenure: Rights-Based Approaches to Peoples and Forests - Some lessons from the Forest Peoples Programme;;"Abstract: In large parts of the world, forests remain the domain of the state in which the rights of forest-dependent
peoples are denied or insecure. E fforts to restore justice to, and alleviate the poverty of, these marginalized
communities have often focused on tenurial reforms. S ometimes those reforms have led to important improvements
in livelihoods, mainly by stabilizing communities’ land use systems and by giving them greater
security. H owever, these improvements have not prevented communities from suffering other forms of
social exclusion and impoverishment. O n the basis of a review of 17 years of programmatic work with
forest peoples in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by the F orest Peoples Programme, this paper explores the
complexity of rights that need recognition if community-based livelihoods in forests are to be secured and
well-being is to be improved. T he conclusion from this review is that programs to reform tenure in forests
must be based on a broader understanding of the basis for asserting rights and must take into account a
far wider range of human rights than are generally considered in forest policy debates. An effective rightsbased
approach to forestry reform to ensure justice and poverty alleviation requires attention to a much
broader spectrum of rights than just the assertion of the right to property. T enures must be appropriate to
the culture and context of the communities concerned. S ystems of representation require effective recognition.
C ommunities must be able to control their lands and resources. C ultural heritage should be protected.
Basic rights to health and life and to civil and political rights and freedoms need to be secured. S ocial,
cultural, and economic rights need to be respected. Although such rights are often recognized in countries’
constitutions, in international customary law, and in nationally ratified human rights treaties, they are
rarely taken into account in narrow sectoral decisionmaking about forests. F orest governance systems
must secure this broader spectrum of rights if forest peoples are to benefit from forestry reforms.";Marcus Colchester;;Rights and Resources Initiative;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2007;en;"forest land;forest conservation;local community";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62552;http://burmalibrary.org/docs18/Beyond%20Tenure-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:59760;Forced migration/internal displacement in Burma - with an emphasis on government-controlled areas;;"This report is a preliminary exploration of forced migration/internal displacement in Burma/Myanmar in two main areas. The first is the status in terms of international standards, specifically those embodied in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, of the people who leave home not because of conflict or relocation orders, but as a result of a range of coercive measures which drive down incomes to the point that the household economy collapses and people have no choice but to leave home. Some analysts describe this form of population movement as ""economic migration"" since it has an economic dimension. The present report, however, looks at the coercive nature of the pressures which contribute to the collapse of the household economy and argues that their compulsory and irresistible nature brings this kind of population movement squarely into the field of forced migration, even though the immediate cause of leaving home may also be described in economic terms... 

The second area is geographic. The report looks at those parts of Burma not covered by the IDP Surveys of the Thailand Burma Border Consortium, which concentrate on the conflict and post-conflict areas of Eastern Burma. It hardly touches on conflict-induced displacement since most parts of Burma covered in these pages, including the major cities, are government-controlled, and there is little overt military conflict in these States and Divisions. Within these parts of the country, the report looks at the coercive measures referred to above. It also carries reports of direct relocation by government agents through which whole rural and urban communities are removed from their homes and either ordered to go to specific places, or else left to their own devices. The report annexes contain more than 500 pages of documentation on forced displacement and causes of displacement in Arakan, Chin, Kachin and Eastern and Northern Shan States as well as Irrawaddy, Magwe, Mandalay, West Pegu, Rangoon and Sagaing Divisions. It also has a section on displacement within urban and peri-urban areas.";Andrew Bosson;;Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-04-2007;en;"land policies;food security;expropriation;farming systems;land governance;dispossession;land grabbing;displacement;research;farmland";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59760;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/IDMC-Burma_report_mai07.pdf;;;;

OBL:46912;ECONOMIC NON-VIABILITY, HUNGER AND MIGRATION: THE CASE OF MAWCHI TOWNSHIP;;"Mawchi is a township in Northwest Karenni that was once a successful mining town. It was often referred to as 'little England' because of the life style on display there and its accompanying standards of living. Private British business interests developed the mines in Mawchi between the world wars, but the local economy began to decline, with the rest of Burma, with Ne Win’s Burmese Way to Socialism. The economy of Mawchi, and the standard of living for people in the Township, has continued to decline across successive military governments.

 

The latest and the most severe economic crisis in Mawchi is the result of the regime's 1996 forced relocation campaign. This program led to the total collapse of agricultural production in the area and the subsequent collapse of the rest of the economy. All the villagers from the surrounding areas were forced to move into the town of Mawchi. The cessation of agricultural production brought about a massive increase in the price of food and a large increase in unemployment. Now most people are more or less constantly hungry and spend their days scrounging around looking for food. All the children in the city are engaged in helping their parents obtain food - collecting birds, worms, frogs and insects to eat. Hardly any rice produced gets to market as it is kept for the family to eat and to pay back debts. The small amount of rice that does reach the market, which most cannot afford, is of the lowest quality and fit only for being boiled. This has caused most people to leave the township for Thailand and a number of the cease-fire areas...";Alison Vicary;;Burma Economic Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;14-05-2003;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/46912;http://burmalibrary.org/docs/BEW-Mawchi.htm;;;;

OBL:72059;Myanmar Ecological Forecasting: Utilizing NASA Earth Observations to Monitor, Map, and Analyze Mangrove Forests in Myanmar for Enhanced;;"... Mangrove forests are one of the most valuable, thriving, and diverse ecosystems on the planet, but they are becoming increasingly exploited and mismanaged (Lee 1999; Giri et al. 2008). In Myanmar, many of these mangrove stands flourished for centuries, virtually untouched until extensive deforestation began in the late 1970’s. At the time there was no legislation to promote sustainable forest management, and as a result the forests were depleted at alarming rates. During the 1990’s, multiple environmental acts were passed to help regulate tree harvesting processes, including the 1992 Forest Law and the 1995 Forest Policy, but they were only mildly successful and difficult to enforce (Oo 2002). The 2000’s brought a new chapter as Myanmar’s expanding economy and lifted political embargos created an explosion of infrastructure and agriculture, once again encroaching on the mangrove’s habitat. Even with the increasing development and encroachment on mangroves, Myanmar’s long state of isolation has made it one of the most species rich countries in all of South-east Asia, and is considered to be one of the last strongholds for large mammals such as tigers and elephants (Leimgruber etal. 2005). In a country with such rich biodiversity and a large dependence on natural resources for income, fuel, and food, preserving Myanmar’s mangroves and raising awareness about sustainability has become a national priority.

This study mapped the spatial extent of three main mangrove regions along the coast of Myanmar during 2000 and 2013, including the Ayeyarwardy Delta, Rakhine and Tanintharyi regions (Oo 2002). The three regions are spread along the coast and vary in population density, which provides a valuable comparison among the regions as to how human and economic pressures can affect mangroves. The Ayeyarwady Delta is centrally located and has the highest population density, followed by Rakhine to the north, and the most remote region being the Tanintharyi to the south. A land change model was then used to produce change maps between 2000 and 2013 and project mangrove coverage to the year 2030 to help resource managers and policy makers craft future decisions. Once the mangroves were classified and projected, SRTM data were used to derive tree canopy heights and biomass estimations using allometric equations.

Mangroves in Myanmar house thriving biodiversity and provide citizens with essential natural products such as food, firewood, and construction materials (Oo 2002). This
ecological forecasting project helped the Myanmar government visualize and quantify their current largest mangrove areas, as well as shed light on the success of previous preservation efforts that may influence future conservation strategies. This project ultimately allowed important decision makers to assess the negative impacts that have occurred due to the deforestation and degradation of mangrove ecosystems. To successfully implement this study and its findings, Dr. Peter Leimgruber and Ellen Aiken
at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute were irreplaceable as they officially handed off the project and its decision making tools to the Myanmar Ministry of
Environment, Conservation and Forestry. The project will serve as a valuable reference for efficiently allocating resources and man power, while adapting new management
strategies to the changing mangrove landscape...";"Samuel J. Weber

EIA research shows that, based on current trends, the two most targeted Hongmu species in
Myanmar - tamalan and padauk - could be logged to commercial extinction in as little as three years.
With financial rewards for illegal loggers and timber smugglers dwarfing traditional incomes, and evidence of corruption facilitating illegal business, Myanmar’s domestic controls will be unable to effectively stem illegal trade. Myanmar urgently needs to engender legal reciprocity from strategic timber trade partners,
particularly China, to ensure Myanmar’s forestry and trade laws are respected along its land border.

In the absence of laws prohibiting illegal timber in China, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) presents the most immediate and effective mechanism to secure China’s respect for Myanmar’s forestry and trade laws.

The Myanmar Government should seek CITES Appendix III protection for its at-risk Hongmu species – Dalbergia oliveri / bariensis (tamalan) and Pterocarpus macrocarpus (padauk) - at the soonest opportunity to ensure trade is in line with sustainable exploitation of existing standing stocks.

The CITES community should assist Myanmar in both instituting and enforcing CITES listings for these key species, and in seeking regional Appendix II listings by the 17th CITES Conference of the Parties (CoP17) in 2016. Enhancing the capacity of Myanmar’s existing CITES Management and Scientific Authorities will be an important element of this work....";;;Environmental Investigation Agency;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2013;en;"land policies;security of tenure (land);deforestation;land law;forest land;land tenure systems;forest management plans";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72057;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/MYANMAR-IN-ROSEWOOD-CRISIS-AS-PRECIOUS-TREES-STOLEN-TO-FEED.pdf;;;;
OBL:75241;Rohingya and national identities in Burma;;"The most controversial aspect of the census recently held in Burma has been the denial of the large Muslim population in Arakan to identify themselves as Rohingya, the term of their choice. The government ban means as many as one million people remain uncounted in Arakan. That is scarcely surprising, as the Burmese government, Rakhine ultra-nationalists and seemingly a majority of the Burmese population have denied for years the existence of the Rohingya identity. According to them, the Rohingya ethnicity is an invention devised by immigrants from Bangladesh to take over the land in Arakan.

Few people have made more effort to deny the claims of ethnicity by the Rohingya than Derek Tonkin, former British ambassador to Thailand and editor of the website Network Myanmar. Mr. Tonkin has reached his conclusions after digging deeply in colonial British archives, where he has not found a single use of the term Rohingya. His command of the British colonial records is nothing less than impressive, but by relying almost solely on these sources he only offers a partial picture, from which I think he draws incorrect conclusions...";Carlos Sardina Galache;;New Mandala;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;22-09-2014;en;"local community;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75241;http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2014/09/22/the-rohingya-and-national-identities-in-burma/;;;;

Introduction for ‘one family’....

In February 2010, Burma Issues conducted a field trip inside Karen State to raise internally displaced persons’ (IDPs) awareness of the upcoming elections. While they were watching a video, the township where the IDPs were staying was attacked by the Burmese army. They had to flee into the jungle and our cameraman decided to follow.

He became particularly interested in one family – a grandmother, 2 parents and 4 young children – who have endured permanent displacement for 3 generations. For 4 months he became deeply involved with them and managed to film an intimate portrait of their daily struggles. He then returned after a period of time to assess if their lives had improved. They hadn’t.

As the family had to leave all of their possessions behind their life is now a cyclical nightmare. Every time they manage to build a hut for shelter, or manage to plant a basic crop, they have to flee from violence. Soldiers and landmines ensure that returning is out of the question. They manage to keep on building new shelters but never manage to make a home.

Although shot in eastern Burma, this video highlights the plight of the countless millions of IDPs across the country who have to contend with extreme violence, food shortages and a lack of access to health care and education.";;;"Burma Issues;Peace Way Foundation";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2009;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/66327;http://www.burmaissues.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=6&Itemid=19;;;;
OBL:59989;Burma: The Changing Nature of Displacement Crises;;"Introduction:
""The shifting nature of conflict in Burma over the past fifteen years has structured a range of
inter-linked displacement crises. In this paper, three main types of forced migration in – and
from – the country are identified: Type 1 – armed-conflict-induced displacement; Type 2 –
State/society-induced displacement; and Type 3 – livelihood/vulnerability-induced
displacement. Each is addressed in a case study, with material drawn from different
geographic areas, illustrating different aspects and impacts of (armed and state-society)
conflict in Burma.
This paper shows that internal displacement in Burma is not only caused by armed conflict in
the insurgent-prone eastern borderlands. While the most acutely vulnerable internally
displaced persons (IDPs) do live in those few areas of the country still affected by significant levels of armed conflict, the phenomenon of forced migration is more complex and
widespread – the product of decades of mis-governance by the militarized state...";Ashley South;;Queen Elizabeth House, University of Oxford (RSC Working Paper No. 39);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-01-2007;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59989;https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/publications/working-paper-series/wp39-burma-changing-nature-displacement-crises-2007.pdf;;;;

OBL:59985;Turning Treasure Into Tears - Mining, Dams and Deforestation in Shwegyin Township, Pegu Division, Burma;;"Executive Summary: ""This report describes how human rights and environmental abuses continue to be
a serious problem in eastern Pegu division, Burma – specifi cally, in Shwegyin
township of Nyaunglebin District. The heavy militarization of the region, the indiscriminate
granting of mining and logging concessions, and the construction of
the Kyauk Naga Dam have led to forced labor, land confi scation, extortion, forced
relocation, and the destruction of the natural environment. The human consequences
of these practices, many of which violate customary and conventional international
law, have been social unrest, increased fi nancial hardship, and great
personal suffering for the victims of human rights abuses.
By contrast, the SPDC and its business partners have benefi ted greatly from
this exploitation. The businessmen, through their contacts, have been able to rapidly
expand their operations to exploit the township’s gold and timber resources.
The SPDC, for its part, is getting rich off the fees and labor exacted from the villagers.
Its dam project will forever change the geography of the
area, at great personal cost to the villagers, but it will give the regime
more electricity and water to irrigate its agro-business projects.
Karen villagers in the area previously panned for gold and
sold it to supplement their incomes from their fi elds and plantations.
They have also long been involved in small-scale logging
of the forests. In 1997, the SPDC and businessmen
began to industrialize the exploitation of gold deposits and
forests in the area. Businessmen from central Burma
eventually arrived and in collusion with the Burmese
Army gained mining concessions and began to force
people off of their land. Villagers in the area continue
to lose their land, and with it their ability to provide
for themselves. The Army abuses local villagers,
confi scates their land, and continues to extort
their money. Commodity prices continue to rise,
compounding the diffi culties of daily survival.
Large numbers of migrant workers have
moved into the area to work the mining concessions
and log the forests. This has created a
complicated tension between the Karen and
these migrants. While the migrant workers
are merely trying to earn enough money to
feed their families, they are doing so on the
Karen’s ancestral land and through the exploitation
of local resources. Most of the migrant
workers are Burman, which increases
ethnic tensions in an area where Burmans often
represent the SPDC and the Army and are already
seen as sneaky and oppressive by the local
Karen. These forms of exploitation increased since the announcement of the construction
of the Kyauk Naga Dam in 2000, which is expected to be completed in late
2006. The SPDC has enabled the mining and logging companies to extract as
much as they can before the area upstream of the dam is fl ooded.
This situation has intensifi ed and increased human rights violations against
villagers in the area. The militarization of the region, as elsewhere, has resulted
in forced labor, extortion of money, goods, and building materials, and forced relocation
by the Army.
In addition to these direct human rights violations, the mining and dam construction
have also resulted in grave environmental degradation of the area. The
mining process has resulted in toxic runoff that has damaged or destroyed fi elds
and plantations downstream. The dam, once completed, will submerge fi elds,
plantations, villages, and forests. In addition, the dam will be used to irrigate rubber
plantations jointly owned by the SPDC and private business interests.
The Burmese Army has also made moves to secure the area in the mountains
to the east of the Shwegyin River. This has led to relocations and the forced displacement
of thousands of Karen villagers living in the mountains. Once the Army
has secured the area, the mining and logging companies will surely follow...";;;EarthRights International;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;20-02-2007;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries;land investments";Land & Investments;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59985;http://www.earthrights.org/files/Burma%20Project/report-_turning_treasure_into_tears.pdf;;;;
OBL:76243;SOUTH-EAST ASIA IRREGULAR MARITIME MOVEMENTS January – June 2014;;"Irregular maritime movements of
mixed populations that include
persons of concern to UNHCR
have been prevalent in the Asia-
Pacific region for many years, but
movements through South-East
Asia, largely originating from the
Bay of Bengal, have increased at a
particularly rapid rate following
inter-communal violence in
Myanmar in June 2012. Since
then, some 87,000 people are
estimated to have departed by
sea from the Bangladesh-
Myanmar border area.
?
This trend has continued through the first half of
2014, during which the main
route of irregular maritime movement in South-East
Asia remained the
journey through the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea f
rom the Bangladesh-
Myanmar maritime border to the Malaysia-Thailand ma
ritime border. Other
irregular maritime movements passing through South-
East Asia followed
routes through the Indian Ocean from South Asia and
Indonesia to Australia,
and across the Strait of Malacca from Malaysia to I
ndonesia.
?
Although the precise number of people travelling on
such routes is unknown
and likely much greater than what has been reported
, UNHCR is aware of over
20,000 irregular maritime departures from the Bangl
adesh-Myanmar border
area in the first half of 2014, in addition to hund
reds who have attempted the
boat journey to Australia.

ns of concern to UNHCR

access to those who travelled along other routes, t

""There is no landlessness in the village

equitably for farming. However,
there is the concern that part of their

as reserved forests by MOECAF. So
this land could possibly be granted by

The villagers did not apply for titles during
the latest land registration process.
The community does not wish for private
land registration even on terraces
because villagers believe that if someone
gets private ownership for a terrace
or tea garden, then other people
may also ask for it and the whole community
may lose all the other lands
which are not put under private ownership
(i.e. shifting cultivation land). The
villagers wish to keep all the land under
communal ownership, as even
owners of private terraces feel their
rights are secure within the community
and do not need SLRD land titles for
this. They would like to have such registration soon, as gold has recently been

OBL:66458;Searching for home: Explorations in new media and the Burmese diaspora in New Zealand;;"ABSTRACT:
""This study examines the place of new media in the maintance of Burmese diasporic identities. Political oppression in Burma, the experience of exile and the importance of opposition movements in the borderlands make the Burmese diaspora a unique and complex group. This study uses tapoetetha-kot, an indigenous Karen research methodology, to explore aspects of new media use and identity among a group of Burmese refugees in Auckland, New Zealand. Common among all participants was a twin desire to share stories of suffering and to have that pain recognised. Participants in this project try to maintain their language and cultural practices, with the intent of returning to a democratic Burma in the future. New media supports this, by providing participants with access to opposition news reports of human rights abuses and suffering; through making cultural and linguistic artifacts accessible, and through providing an easy means of communication with friends and family in Burma and the borderlands.""...

Land confiscation often occurs at proposed development, natural resource extraction, or private business sites, including hydro-electric dams, mining and logging projects, and plantation agriculture. Increased militarisation at these sites perpetuates a cycle of land confiscation in areas adjacent to the sites for the development of military camps, roads, or other infrastructure to support the project. This occurs in addition to the large-scale loss of cultivable land, forest, waterways and natural resources due to environmental degradation as a result of development or extractive industrial projects –without compensation for the loss or destruction of land...""

OBL:73494;The end of exile;;"Since Myanmar opened up under the semi-civilian government in 2011, the diaspora have been encouraged to return.

As persecution on the basis of political activity or ethnicity is often the reason they left, many are reluctant to return permanently to what is an unclear political situation. As a result, brief stays are common. After so many years away from home, family and friends, it is difficult to image the experience of returning.

Twenty-four years after leaving his home for a new life in Australia, Saya Nai Tin Aye, my Burmese teacher, applied for a tourist visa to return to Myanmar. The process took longer than it does for regular tourists, as the Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Immigration ministries must approve the application. It so happened that my trip to Myanmar would coincide with his. He invited me to visit his home village.

Nai Tin Aye, once president of the Australia Mon Association, is a softly spoken man, with a keen interest and knowledge of history. He has an inspiringly fastidious memory for dates. He left his home in Kawkareik Township, Kayin State in 1991. Formally a star volleyball player and school principal, he was well known and liked in the area. He also spent eight years in the armed resistance, living in the jungle and resisting the Tatmadaw (Burma Army).

In the 1990 elections, Nai Tin Aye worked for a local Mon politician. A warrant was issued for his arrest after authorities alleged irregularities in the campaign accounts. He fled to Thailand, registered with the UNHCR and was resettled in Australia in 1996. Between living in the jungle, Thailand and Australia, he has been away from his wife and three children for over 30 years.

Arriving in Nai Tin Aye’s village I was at somewhat of a loss; the place was considerably larger than I had expected, and I did not know the address. I hadn’t been able to make a telephone connection from Yangon. The motorcycle taxi driver who had reluctantly driven me out here suggested retiringly that I spend the night in a nearby town instead. We approached a group of men in a teashop, and our concerns eased. They had no doubt it was the Sayar Gyi (“principal” or “great teacher”) who we were looking for, and escorted us to his home...";James T.

OBL:73492;With only our voices, what can we do?. (video);;"Villagers in Karen areas of southeast Myanmar continue to face widespread land confiscation at the hands of a multiplicity of actors. Much of this can be attributed to the rapid expansion of domestic and international commercial interest and investment in southeast Myanmar since the January 2012 preliminary ceasefire between the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Myanmar government. KHRG first documented this in a 2013 report entitled ‘Losing Ground’, which documented cases of land confiscation between January 2011 and November 2012. This report, ‘With only our voices, what can we do?’, is a follow up to that analysis and highlights continued issue areas while identifying newly documented trends. The present analysis assesses land confiscation according to a number of different factors, including: land use type; geographic distribution across KHRG’s seven research areas; perpetrators involved; whether or not compensation and/or consultation occurred; and the effects that confiscation had on local villagers. This report also seeks to highlight local responses to land confiscation, emphasising the agency that individuals and communities in southeast Myanmar already possess and the obstacles that they face when attempting to protect their own human rights. By focusing on local perspectives and giving priority to villagers’ voices, this report aims to provide local, national, and international actors with a resource that will allow them to base policy and programmatic decisions that will impact communities in southeast Myanmar more closely on the experiences and concerns of the people living there...";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-06-2015;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73492;http://www.khrg.org/2015/06/with-only-our-voices-what-can-we-do-land-confiscation-and-local-response;;;;

This area is rugged hills dotted with small villages, averaging 10-50 households (population 50-300) per village. Estimates are that 100 or more villages may be affected. Every village has been ordered to move either to SLORC Army camps surrounding Papun, such as Papun, Kaw Boke, Par Haik, or Ka Hee Kyo (all along the Papun - Kyauk Nyat road route) or to DKBA headquarters far to the south at Khaw Taw (Myaing Gyi Ngu) in Pa'an District. The orders have all been issued by SLORC. Generally a SLORC column enters the village with only a few DKBA soldiers accompanying them, and the SLORC officer issues the order. Villagers confirm that DKBA never operates in the area by themselves anymore - DKBA soldiers only appear in small groups as part of SLORC columns.

The report strongly urges models of investment that do not involve large-scale land acquisitions, but rather work together with local land users, respecting their land rights and the ability of small-scale farmers themselves to play a key role in investing to meet the food and resource demands of the future.

The conclusions of the report are based on case studies that provide indicative evidence of local and national realities, and on the ongoing global monitoring of large-scale land deals for which data are subject to a continuous process of verification.

But while research and monitoring will continue, this report draws some conclusions and policy implications from the evidence we have already";"Ward Anseeuw

OBL:64774;Engaging the ASEAN: Toward a Regional Advocacy on Land Rights;;"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was
established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok by the five
original Member Countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Brunei Darussalam joined on
8 January 1984; Vietnam, on 28 July 1995; Lao PDR and
Myanmar, on 23 July 1997; and Cambodia, on 30 April 1999.
In principle, ASEAN supports poverty reduction, food security,
sustainable development, and greater equity in the ASEAN
region. However, a closer look at the pronouncements contained
in its policy documents reveals that an economically-driven
framework of growth still drives the work of ASEAN, even as it
strives to create “caring societies”. While the organization does
have a policy of engaging NGOs, it is not clear how NGOs could
participate meaningfully in providing direction for ASEAN’s
work. This requires clarification on the part of ASEAN.
This issue brief argues that before ASEAN could engage in
meaningful dialogue with NGOs, it will first have to grapple with
a number of issues, namely, (1) food security for farmers that
likewise promotes poverty eradication and rural development; (2)
property rights as a fundamental human right of farmers; (3)
ensuring justice in poverty eradication and rural development
efforts; and (4) economic growth as a precursor for social
development.
The key structures in the ASEAN that need to be engaged are
the following: the ASEAN Summit; the ASEAN Socio-Cultural
Community; the ASEAN Ministers on Poverty Eradication and
Rural Development; Senior Ministers on Poverty Eradication and
Rural Development; Functional Cooperation Bodies (e.g. Poverty
Eradication; Social Development); the ASEAN-Japan Dialogue;

In its 2015 report, ‘With only our voices, what can we do?’, KHRG highlights four main land use types which lead to land confiscation: infrastructure projects, natural resource extraction, commercial agriculture projects, and military activities. Based on testimony from local villagers, the Myanmar government; domestic corporate actors; and Tatmadaw and Karen ethnic armed groups (EAGs) are all identified as being complicit in the confiscation of land from local communities in southeast Myanmar. Against this bleak background, local villagers report using a variety of strategies to prevent and mitigate the impacts of land confiscation, such as reaching out to civil society organisations (CSOs) and the media, negotiating with actors involved in projects, and lobbying both the Myanmar government and Karen EAGs.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;06-08-2015;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/100714;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/KHRG-2015-08-06-Press_release-confiscation_and_local_response_in_southeast-Myanmar-en.pdf;;;;

""This submission describes the emerging landscape as U.S. businesses reengage in Burma and
identifies specific human rights concerns associated with current and prospective corporate
activities in Burma (Myanmar). A number of companies, including General Electric, have
already invested in Burma, and U.S. oil supermajors are considering participation in upcoming
auctions for oil blocks. Increased foreign investment has already been linked to large-scale
displacement of local communities and loss of traditional livelihoods in Burma. The legal
framework for land rights is inadequate to protect the fundamental human rights of those whose
homes and fields stand in the way of economic development; indeed, it facilitates arbitrary and
inadequately compensated alienation of land. Moreover, violence and gross human rights abuses
continue to occur in association with natural resource development projects, as at the Letpadaung
Copper Mine at Monywa, and in Shan State along the Shwe Gas Pipeline corridor.
Having decided that public disclosure, rather than regulation, is a more appropriate tool to
address the human rights and environmental concerns associated with Western investment in
Burma, the U.S. Government has proposed Reporting Requirements for Responsible Investment
in Burma that are expected to take effect prior to April 2013. While they may assist government
and civil society to monitor the human rights implications of the relaxation of U.S. sanctions on
Burma, these Reporting Requirements have a number of troubling weaknesses that may allow
serious human rights risks to avoid detection. Moreover, while the U.S. is now allowing the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to extend loans to Burma, such projects are
already being met with complaints over lack of transparency and consultation...";;;Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;28-02-2013;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61292;http://burmalibrary.org/docs15/Marco_Simons_to_%20Lantos_Commission-Business_and_Human_Rights_in_Myanmar.pdf;;;;

YANGON, 11 April 2012 (IRIN) - ""Local NGOs in northern Myanmar with access to both sides of an ongoing conflict between government forces and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) are playing a key role in addressing the needs of thousands of displaced.

There are four local cross-line Burmese NGOs and community-based groups: Karuna Myanmar Social Services (KMSS), the Metta Development Foundation, the Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC) and the Shalom Foundation.

“We are working between two warring parties - this is the biggest challenge we face,” Win Tun Kyi, programme coordinator for KMSS, a faith-based group affiliated with the Catholic Church, told IRIN.

“It’s already been 10 months [of being displaced] - these people have suffered too much,” said Sai Sam Kham, executive director of Metta, citing food, shelter, water and sanitation, and psychosocial support as the primary needs.

The UN estimates that up to 55,000 people have been displaced by fighting inside Myanmar between government forces and the KIA, since the collapse of a 17-year ceasefire between the two sides in June 2011.

The KIA has been fighting for greater autonomy from the country’s central government since 1961.

Around 20,000 of the displaced are living in government-controlled areas, up to 35,000 more are in KIA-controlled areas; mostly in camps, and another several thousand are believed to be staying with host families across the border in China...""...""...Les organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) locales qui ont accès aux victimes des deux côtés du conflit opposant les forces gouvernementales à l’Armée pour l’indépendance du Kachin (KIA) dans le nord du Myanmar jouent un rôle clé dans la réponse aux besoins de milliers de personnes déplacées.

Quatre ONG locales et groupes communautaires birmans interviennent auprès des victimes des deux côtés du conflit : Karuna Myanmar Social Services (KMSS), la Metta Development Foundation, la Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC) et la Shalom Foundation.

« Nous sommes pris entre les parties en conflit – C’est le plus grand défi auquel nous sommes confrontés », a dit à IRIN Win Tun Kyi, coordinateur de programme auprès de KMSS, un groupe confessionnel catholique.

« Cela fait déjà dix mois [qu’elles sont déplacées] – ces populations ont beaucoup trop souffert », a dit Sai Sam Kham, directeur exécutif de Metta, qui a indiqué que les besoins de bases incluent la nourriture, les abris, l’eau, l’hygiène et les soutiens psychologiques.

OBL:98503;Land and River Grabbing: the Mekong’s Greatest Challenge;;"Throughout the Mekong region, large-scale development projects such
as hydropower dams, mines, conventional power plants, and mono-crop
plantations are displacing communities and limiting access to natural
resources. Several hydropower dams have already been built on the
Upper Mekong in China’s Yunnan Province, and the governments of
Cambodia, Laos and Thailand are planning eleven additional large dams
on the Mekong River’s mainstream. If completed, these dams would
not only destroy local ecosystems, but also reduce the  ow of silt
throughout the Mekong River system, and block major  sh migrations,
placing at risk over sixty million people who depend on the Mekong for
their food security and income.
It’s vital for citizens of all six nations who share the Mekong basin’s rich
resources to work together to promote greater accountability in
development planning. This is exactly what is happening among a new
generation of Mekong activists. Over the past nine years, alumni from
EarthRights International’s Mekong School representing communities
from the source to the mouth of the Mekong have been working together
to advocate for stronger human rights and environmental protection in
the region.
In sharing these reports from their communities, Mekong School Alumni
hope to inspire citizens throughout the Mekong region to consider the
social and environmental impacts of hydropower dams, mines, power
plants and other large development projects and to join together to
advocate for greater transparency and public participation in development
planning...."" .....

The paper aims to present a case of societal security by highlighting the importance of national identity. It intends to explore the reasons for portraying cross-border mobility of border minorities as existential threats to the integrity of the Thai state. More specifically, it will investigate the motives of the securitising actor, the Thai state – and examine why the issue evoked security concerns in the wake of the 1997 economic crisis and the way 'emergency measures' were introduced. This paper will illustrate the importance of ethnocized discourses on national identity by broadening the traditional security studies' framework on states and political-military competition at the borderlands.;Mika Toyota;;Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies Singapore;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-12-2005;en;displacement;Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/57268;https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP102.pdf;;;;

Saw H--- also described demands for the provision of a pig to Border Guard soldiers three days before this interview took place and the beating of a villager by DKBA soldiers in 2010. He noted the ways in which movement restrictions that prevent villagers from travelling on rivers and sleeping in or bringing food to their farm huts negatively impact harvests and food security.

On Nov 14th 1996, the Slorc posted a notice at the gate of Kyandaw Cemetery giving relatives one month's notice to move the remains to a new site at Shwe Nyaung-bin, two hours drive from Rangoon.

Kyandaw cemetery is located on 50-70 acres of what has become prime real estate in downtown Rangoon, near Hantha-waddy intersection. Both Burmese and foreigners are buried there of Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist faiths. Rumours abound in Rangoon as to what the military government wants the land for; a casino to be built by Khun Sa, a hotel to be built with foreign investment, or, a Japanese shopping center.

Whatever is planned for this land remains unknown as the Slorc refuse to specify at this stage. A Slorc spokesman, Major Hla Min stated on a recent Asian Business News television interview: ""Yangon has changed, and the location of the cemetery, once it was probably on the outskirts of Yangon, but today its almost in the center of the city, so naturally it has to be relocated."" ...";;;The Irrawaddy;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-01-1997;en;"urban population;displacement;urban areas";"Land Conflicts;Urban Tenure";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60083;http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=188;;;;

OBL:62580;The Burden of War - Women bear burden of displacement;;"Executive Summary:
""Worsening conflict and abuses by Burmese government troops in
northern Shan State have displaced over 2,000 Palaung villagers from
fifteen villages in three townships since March 2011. About 1,000,
mainly women and children, remain in three IDP settlements in Mantong
and Namkham townships, facing serious shortages of food and medicine;
most of the rest have dispersed to find work in China.
Burmese troops have been launching offensives to crush the Kachin
Independence Army (KIA), the Ta-ang National Liberation Army (TNLA),
and the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N), to secure control of strategic
trading and investment areas on the Chinese border, particularly the route
of China’s trans-Burma oil and gas pipelines. In rural Palaung areas,
patrols from sixteen Burma Army battalions and local militia have been
forcibly conscripting villagers as soldiers and porters, looting livestock
and property, and torturing and killing villagers suspected of supporting
the resistance. This has caused entire villages to become abandoned.
Interviews conducted by PWO in September 2012 show that the burden
of displacement is falling largely on women, as most men have fled or
migrated to work elsewhere. The ratio of women to men of working age
in the IDP camps is 4:1. Women, including pregnant mothers, had to
walk for up to a week through the jungle to reach the camps, carrying
their children and possessions, and avoiding Burmese army patrols and
landmines. Elderly people were left behind.
Little aid has reached the IDP settlements, particular the largest camp
housing over 500 in a remote mountainous area north of Manton, where
shortages of water, food and medicines are causing widespread disease.
Mothers are struggling to feed their families on loans of rice from local
villagers, and have taken their daughters out of school. Some women
have left children with relatives and gone to find work in China.
PWO is calling urgently for aid to these IDPs, and for political pressure
on Burma’s government to end its military offensives and abuses, pull
back troops from conflict areas, and begin meaningful political dialogue
to address the root causes of the conflict.";;;Palaung Women's Organization;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;03-11-2012;en;"expropriation;land grabbing;displacement;indigenous peoples;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62580;http://burmalibrary.org/docs14/The_Burden_of_War-red.pdf;;;;

Among these orders are some being used to restrict or prevent access to land of people who rightfully occupy or cultivate the land, as in the case of villagers from some 26 villages affected by the copper mining project in the Letpadaung Mountain range in Sagaing Region, on which the Asian Human Rights Commission has previously spoken (AHRC-PRL-044-2012). The AHRC has obtained copies of a series of orders issued by Zaw Moe Aung, chief administrator of Sarlingyi Township, where villagers have been fighting since mid-2012 against the expansion of copper mining in the region onto their farmlands. The orders, issued under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, prohibit villagers from access to their farmlands or any form of use of the farmlands, such as for the grazing of cattle.

Asia World Company began building the dam in Toh Boh, Day Loh village tract during 2005. The other two projects involved the confiscation of 2,400 acres, against which the villagers formed a committee to petition for compensation and were met with threats of imprisonment.

OBL:63561;Yangon’s Development Challenges;;"Overview:
""Yangon is an attractive and relatively livable city that is on the brink of dramatic change. If the government of Myanmar continues its recent program of economic and political reform, the economy of the country is likely to take off, and much of the growth will be concentrated in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city and commercial capital. This paper argues that Yangon is poorly prepared to cope with the pressures of growth because it has only begun to develop a comprehensive land use and development plan for the city that would guide the location of key activities including export-oriented industries and port terminals. In addition, the city lacks the financial resources to finance the infrastructure and other public services required to serve the existing population, let alone support a population that is larger and better off. Failure to address these challenges will not only make Yangon a less livable city but will also reduce the rate of economic growth for the entire country. Myanmar needs a dynamic and vibrant Yangon to thrive.""...""...In sum, Yangon and Myanmar appear to be on the verge of explosive growth, making up for decades of stagnation or decline. Yangon is almost certain to become a key engine in the nation’s economic growth as Myanmar’s largest city, commercial capital, most important port and tourist destination, and most logical site for export-oriented manufacturing. But how well Yangon fulfills these roles depends on how well the city is managed. Yangon’s slow growth in the past had a hidden benefit in that it preserved many assets—greenery, parks and open spaces and historic buildings—that other Asian cities lost. As a result, Yangon has an opportunity to avoid becoming another sprawling, polluted and highly congested Asian megacity and grow instead into a greener and more livable metropolis. But it will do so only if it prepares a plan before development threatens to overwhelm it. And the plan will succeed only if it is based on thoughtful and realistic analyses of issues like the location of special economic zones and ports and the provision of affordable housing and quality infrastructure.";"José A.

origin and the host country. Through transnational activities, refugees can
have a positive impact on the home country by contributing to peace-building

community engagement and political transnationalism will illustrate. Clearly,
the increased capacity and networks of the Burmese diaspora have bestowed
it with a large (future) potential to influence peace-building, development
and conflict. Therefore, it is argued here that the various civil, political and

initiated by international actors, next to stakeholders inside the country.""...

lic buildings, with host families or in the forest. In
addition, an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 persons have
reportedly sought refuge in China. The numbers of
IDPs continue to fluctuate and in some locations, a
small number of IDPs temporarily returned to their
villages to attempt savaging some of their liveli?
hood, leaving some of their family members in
camps or with relatives. Available information indi?
cates that these returns are not permanent or sub?
stantial in numbers, as IDPs continue to be con?
cerned over ongoing tensions and instability as well
as presence of landmines...In an effort to improve the level of assistance and co?
ordination, local and international partners undertook
an analysis of the situation in November 2011 and
identified scenarios for the coming six months, against
which sectoral plans and priorities were identified. The
plan was revised in February 2012, and again in June
2012 taking into account the rapidly changing situa?
tion, protracted displacement and ongoing discussions
around return planning.  
The revised planning document includes an analysis of
the assistance provided to date, of the scenario in the
coming year (March 2012?February 2013), and a re?
view of sectoral requirements, including those to cater
for existing gaps and expected need for additional re?
sources for the provision of life?saving relief assistance
as well as to support pockets of return for a total of up
to 85,000 people affected by the ongoing instability.
This follows the steady increase in the numbers of IDPs
across Kachin and Northern Shan States, partly in re?
sponse to ongoing incidents and insecurity in these
areas. It also takes into consideration the additional
needs caused by the monsoon rains.  
Partners estimated that relief assistance would be re?
quired even if the situation was to normalize in the
coming months, as most of the IDPs lost their posses?
sions, their sources of livelihood, the planting season
and social services would take some time to become
fully functional again. In addition, the monsoon season
has an adverse impact on the already challenging shel?
ter and WASH conditions in the IDP locations, as well
as on the logistical situation. Road conditions are con?
tinuously deteriorating due to the heavy rains, making
the provision of assistance all the more important.  
In line with the previous version of the document de?
veloped in March 2012, the plan concentrates on the
immediate relief requirements for one year (March
2012?February 2013). The requirements articulated in
the plan include remaining needs of up to 85,000
people either currently displaced or likely be dis?
placed in the months to come. Humanitarian part?
ners predict that a total of US$35.8 million are re?
quired to cover the humanitarian needs for the pe?
riod of March 2012 to February 2013. Priorities for

OBL:70897;The impact of swidden decline on livelihoods and ecosystem services in Southeast Asia: A review of the evidence from 1990 to 2015;;"Abstract: ""Global economic change and policy interventions
are driving transitions from long-fallow swidden (LFS)
systems to alternative land uses in Southeast Asia’s uplands.
This study presents a systematic review of how these
transitions impact upon livelihoods and ecosystem services
in the region. Over 17 000 studies published between 1950
and 2015 were narrowed, based on relevance and quality, to
93 studies for further analysis. Our analysis of land-use
transitions from swidden to intensified cropping systems
showed several outcomes: more households had increased
overall income, but these benefits came at significant cost
such as reductions of customary practice, socio-economic
wellbeing, livelihood options, and staple yields. Examining
the effects of transitions on soil properties revealed negative
impacts on soil organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity,
and aboveground carbon. Taken together, the proximate and
underlying drivers of the transitions from LFS to alternative
land uses, especially intensified perennial and annual cash
cropping, led to significant declines in pre-existing
livelihood security and the ecosystem services supporting
this security. Our results suggest that policies imposing landuse
transitions on upland farmers so as to improve
livelihoods and environments have been misguided; in the
context of varied land uses, swidden agriculture can support
livelihoods and ecosystem services that will help buffer the
impacts of climate change in Southeast Asia.""

OBL:71230;Crude Harvest - Selling Mexico's Oil (video);;"Mexico may be hitting the perfect storm when it opens its energy resources to foreign investors...

Against the backdrop of Mexico's ever-widening gap between rich and poor, growing violence, and stalled economy, President Enrique Pena Nieto has passed a series of economic reforms.

Under these reforms, Mexico's oil, which was expropriated from foreign interests 75 years ago, is now for sale to private, international companies.

NAFTA has had a very bright side but also has had a very dark side…the dark side of globalisation has been organised crime.

Edgardo Buscaglia, author, 'State Vacuums in Mexico'

The reforms are the most divisive the country has seen in a century. Thousands are protesting against them, saying the new regulations could bring the nation to a tipping point as organised crime and violence would spiral out of control.

When it comes to big business and drilling for oil, Mexico's farmers are the most vulnerable.

Twenty years ago, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which opened Mexico up to trade with the US and Canada, led to the collapse of agriculture, and paved the way to the privatization of oil.

The operations of Mexico's state-owned oil company, Pemex, have never been entirely transparent, and communities have been crippled by oil disasters. For instance, in October 2013, the state of Tabasco experienced its worst oil disaster when a drill site exploded and burned for 55 days, contaminating the surrounding land and water. Villagers closest to the site say they are suffering from health problems and have lost their livestock. They say Pemex has never accepted responsibility for the accident, nor has it offered any compensation.

People who appear in this film, including lawyers working with communities affected by the oil industry, estimate things are likely to get worse when foreign companies start drilling. Mexican human rights lawyer Efrain Rodriguez Leon says, ""if Pemex committed all of these injustices, we can't imagine what abuses our indigenous brothers will suffer at the hands of these private companies.""

With multinationals poised to come, Mexican farmers stand to lose their livelihoods and land, because the new reforms allow companies to drill and occupy areas wherever there is oil.

In Crude harvest: selling Mexico's oil, we meet the victims of oil drilling and free trade, and examine what could happen when foreign investors move in";"Filmmakers: Paul Sapin

Although the displaced populations concerned may be in dire need of assistance and protection, and could benefit

conflict is the inhibiting factor in some cases, in others, the governments concerned do not request aid and by and large reject
any that is offered. Only rarely does the United Nations Security Council deem such situations to be threats to international
peace and security and demand entry.

Leading examples of governments that successfully bar international involvement with their displaced populations are Turkey,
Burma, and Algeria. The situations in the three countries are, of course, quite different. In Turkey and Burma, governments

allowed unbridled land confiscation for infrastructure,

constitution identifies the state as being the ultimate owner of all
land in Burma. Antiquated laws such as the 1894 Lan

OBL:69800;Poison Clouds: Lessons from Burma’s largest coal project at Tigyit;;"Summary:
""• Although Burma is rich in energy resources, the ruling military regime exports those
resources, leaving people with chronic energy shortages. The exploitation of natural
resources, including through mining, has caused severe environmental and social
impacts on local communities as companies that invest in these projects have no
accountability to affected communities.
• There are over 16 large-scale coal deposits in Burma, with total coal resources of over
270 Million tons (Mt). Tigyit is Burma’s biggest open pit coal mine, producing nearly
2,000 tons of coal every day.
• The Tigyit coal mine and coal-fi red power plant are located just 13 miles from Burma’s
famous Inle Lake, a heritage site of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Water
polluted by the mine and waste from the power plant fl ow into the Lake via the Balu
Creek but no study of the impact of the project on the Lake has been made public.
• Coal from the mine is transported to Burma’s only operating coal-fi red power plant in
Tigyit. The plant uses 640,000 tons of coal per year to produce 600 Gigawatts of power
with a capacity of 120 Megawatts. 100-150 tons of toxic fl y ash waste is generated per
day. The majority of power from the plant is slated for use at an iron mining factory that
will be operated by Russian and Italian companies.
• Implementation of the mine and power plant began in 2002 by the China National
Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Burmese companies Eden Group and
Shan Yoma Nagar.
• Two nearby villages of Lai Khar and Taung Pola were forced to relocate for the project
and over 500 acres of farmlands have been confi scated. Farming families facing eviction
and loss of lands are going hungry and have turned to cutting down trees to sell for
fi rewood or migrated in order to survive. Explosions from the mine have destroyed
local pagodas.
• Air and water pollution is threatening the agriculture and health of nearly 12,000 people
that live within a fi ve mile radius of the project who may eventually have to move out.
Currently 50% of the local population is suffering from skin rashes.
• The Pa-Oh Youth Organization and Kyoju Action Network have been monitoring
the project since February 2010 and urges the companies and government to suspend
operations pending full environment, social and health impact assessments. The
organization also urges local communities not to sign documents without understanding
them and to oppose corruption and exploitation which harms the communities’
livelihoods and natural resources.";;;Pa-Oh Youth Organization (PYO), The Kyoju Action Network (KAN);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-12-2010;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/69800;http://burmalibrary.org/docs11/PoisonClouds%28en%29.pdf;;;;
OBL:69801;Humanitarian Impact of Landmines in Burma/Myanmar;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ""While the existing data available on landmine victims
indicate that Burma/Myanmar1 faces one of the most
severe landmine problems in the world today, little is
known about the actual extent of the problem, the
impact on affected populations, communities’ mine
action needs and how different actors can become
more involved in mine action.
The Government of Burma/Myanmar has prohibited
almost all forms of mine action with the exception of
a limited amount of prosthetic assistance to people
with amputated limbs through general health
programmes. Some Mine Risk Education (MRE) is also
conducted in areas which are partly or fully under the
control of armed non-State actors (NSAs) as is victim
assistance and some survey work, however, without
Government authorisation.
Since starting operations in 2006, Geneva Call and
DCA Mine Action, like other local and international
actors wishing to undertake mine action, have been
struggling to identify how best to do this in the limited
humanitarian space available in Burma/Myanmar.
Lack of Government permission to start mine action
activities and difficult access to mine-affected areas
are two of the main obstacles identified by these
actors. In response to this apparent conflict between
interest and opportunity, Geneva Call and DCA Mine
Action decided to produce a report on the landmine
problem in Burma/Myanmar, which would pay
particular attention to what can be done to address
the identified needs. The report is based on research
carried out between June and September 2010.
Thirty two different stakeholders in Burma/Myanmar,
Thailand, Bangladesh and China were interviewed
in order to better understand the current, medium- and
long-term effects of the landmine problem on
affected local communities and to identify possible
mine action interventions.
The problem with anti-personnel mines in Burma/
Myanmar originates from decades of armed conflict,
which is still ongoing in some parts or the country.
Anti-personnel mines are still being used today by
the armed forces of the Government of Burma/
Myanmar (the Tatmadaw), by various non-State actors
(NSAs), as well as by businessmen and villagers.
Ten out of Burma/Myanmar’s 14 States and Divisions are
mine contaminated. The eastern States and Divisions
bordering Thailand are particularly contaminated
with mines. Some areas bordering Bangladesh and
China are also mined, and mine accidents have
occurred there. An estimated five million people
live in townships that contain mine-contaminated
areas, and are in need of Mine Risk Education (MRE)
to reduce risky behaviour, and victim assistance for
those already injured.
With estimates of mine victim numbers still unclear
due to a lack of reliable data, the report finds that
a significant proportion of the children affected in
landmine accidents in NSA areas are child soldiers.
In Karenni/Kaya State every second child is a child
soldier; in Karen/Kayin State every fourth child is a
child soldier.
The Government’s refusal to grant permission for
mine action activities and the ongoing conflict have
left no real space for humanitarian demining in
Burma/Myanmar. However, some demining activities
are being undertaken by the Tatmadaw and by
NSAs, although it is unclear whether these activities
should be regarded as military or humanitarian
demining. Similarly, the complicated domestic
situation only leaves limited space for implementing
comprehensive surveys. Those surveys that have
been carried out by Community Based Organizations
(CBO), show significant mine contamination. However
such surveys can only be an indicator of the reality
on the ground as they are limited in geographical
scope.
At present, local CBOs and national NGOs have better
access to mined areas than the UN and international
NGOs. However, CBOs and national NGO mine action
activities are limited to MRE and victim assistance-related
activities because of the Government
restrictions placed on other forms of mine action.
These activities are only conducted on a discreet
level – MRE is provided under general Risk Reduction
or health programmes while victim assistance falls
under general disability assistance programmes.
A national ban on anti-personnel mines and a ban by
the major NSA users of landmines do not seem to be
realistic in the near future. Nevertheless, the success
of local/regional bans on anti-personnel mines,
especially in the western part of Burma/Myanmar
could serve as an inspiration and a positive harbinger
of progress for this country marred by decades of
internal strife and war.";;;"Geneva Call;DCA Mine Action";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-12-2010;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/69801;http://burmalibrary.org/docs11/2011_GC_BURMA_Landmine_RPT_CD-Rom_ENG-red.pdf;;;;

Indigenous Peoples to forests, rangelands, and wetlands are often not
written down or shown on government maps, but they are a fundamental
reality. They cover more than 50 percent of the world’s land surface, yet
new research by RRI in 2015 showed that just 10 percent of the world’s
land is legally recognized as community-owned.2
This means that governments formally recognize communities’
ownership rights to less than 20 percent of the land they have
historically owned.
This huge gap means that vast areas of the world remain open to
contest. Disputes over land ownership are a major driver of conflict:
the unclear status of customary rights has played a role in all but three
of the 30-plus armed conflicts in Africa between 1990 and 2009.3
Even though the constitutions of many countries
recognize customary law, and recognize customary
rights in statutory law, implementation is often
weak or nonexistent.,,";Fred Pearce;;Rights and Resources Initiative;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;03-02-2016;en;"forest land;forest conservation;local community";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72551;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/RRI-2016-Closing_the_Gap.pdf;;;;

the construction of a combined inland waterway and highway transportation system
connecting Mizoram State in Northeast India with a Bay of Bengal deepsea port at Sitetway,
Arakan State in Western Burma. The Indian government is entirely financing the
Kaladan Project, and these funds are officially classified as development aid to Burma.
Once completed, the infrastructure will belong to the Burma government, but the project
is unquestionably designed to achieve India’s economic and geostrategic interests. The
Kaladan Project - conceived in 2003, formalized in 2008 and slated for completion in 2015 - is
a cornerstone of India’s “Look East Policy” aimed at expanding Indian economic and
political influence in Southeast and East Asia. The Kaladan Project is being developed in
Arakan and Chin States - Burma’s least-developed and most poverty-prone states - where
improved infrastructure is badly needed. Yet it remains an open question whether the
Kaladan Project will be implemented in a way that ensures the people living along the
project route are the main beneficiaries of this large-scale infrastructure development.

OBL:100872;Environmental Damage and Poverty Migration among Myanmar and its Neighbors;;"In recent years migration studies have theorized that 21st-century migration is following patterns that both incorporate and diverge from academic and policymaking explanations of late 20th-century migration. The case of Myanmar, whose out-migration is well-known and well-enumerated, nevertheless shows both a less-known pattern of in-migration in rural areas as well as environmental (and not only economic) factors in both in- and out- migration. 
James Clifford’s earlier, Asia-Pacific-focused work Routes, published in 1997, was influential in modifying the conventional academic foci on migration. Addressing the “subjectivity” of the ethnographers of peoples and migrations and their subjects as more an issue of shared, though differing, ideas of movement and space, he brought a new awareness of the interplay between semantic webs purportedly possessed by fieldwork subjects and their would-be interpreters among scholars. He followed this work with a particular narrative of Native American migration in Returns, published in 2013. Both of these works open the door for new attempts to study and interview migrants in their own situations and to grasp the diversity of migration beyond push-pull factors. One burgeoning methodology within this new research initiative was that of ethnographic interviews with migrants. Clifford had revealed an extremely human, molecularly detailed side of interviewees and respondents. Newer works began to concentrate almost exclusively on the migrants’ own narratives and to pull slighter, more localized explanations from them in the same mode as Charmaz’s grounded theory. Here were the roots of ‘new migration’ ideas. With the wealth of published data becoming available from migrants worldwide, small and large differences between their experiences and general migration theory became more apparent..."".....Paper delivered at the International Conference on Burma/Myanmar Studies: Burma/Myanmar in Transition: Connectivity, Changes and Challenges: University Academic Service Centre (UNISERV), Chiang Mai University, Thailand, 24-­26 July 2015.";Lynn Thiesmeyer;;"International Conference on Burma/Myanmar Studies.

OBL:64502;Burma’s Resource Curse The case for revenue transparency in the oil and gas sector (English);;"Executive
Summary:
""Burma is rich in natural resources, particularly natural gas and oil.
Yet instead of using these resources for the country’s development
through industry and job growth, military leaders have been exporting
them for over a decade. This has generated huge revenue flows, but
a lack of transparency and mismanagement of these revenues has left
Burma with some of the worse development indicators in the world,
creating a resource curse.
Sales revenues of natural gas exports alone amounted to US$ 2.5 billion
in 2010-11. It is estimated that this amount will increase by over 60%
to US$ 4.1 billion starting from 2013 as three additional production
blocks come on line. Further revenues will be generated from over 40
additional oil and gas blocks that are currently under exploration.
Despite this enormous wealth, Burma remains extremely poor and its
people live with chronic energy shortages. It is a country crippled by
corruption, with its major businesses controlled by military companies
and cronies. Burma is censured for major human rights violations, and
continues to suffer from a decades-old civil war between the ruling
government and ethnic peoples. Due to Burma’s lack of protection
laws, projects which extract and export natural resources have directly
led to human rights abuses such as forced labor, land confiscation,
rape and displacement, as well as severe environmental degradation.
The projects also fuel armed conflict as government and ethnic troops
clash in order to access and control project areas. The revenues from
resource extraction projects have in turn helped prop up authoritarian
rule and enrich top military generals.
The report analyzes the previous Than Shwe regime and new
military-dominated government’s lack of transparency around oil

and gas revenues, lack of an accountable system to manage revenue,
corruption, and a lack of equitable benefit sharing of resource
revenues. Although a new “civilian” government is now in place, under
Burma’s new constitution, the military remains firmly outside the law
and beyond civilian control. The role of military companies in Burma’s
economy and in accessing and managing Burma’s massive oil and gas
revenues remain unknown and unregulated. The government does not
disclose how much it receives in gas revenues, or how those revenues
are managed or spent. Foreign oil companies engaging in Burma’s oil
and gas sector also refuse to publish how much and how they pay the
military regime.
There is therefore an urgent need for Burma to manage oil and gas
revenues with greater transparency and accountability as well as to
reform its military-dominated economy to ensure that the benefits of
the country’s resources are shared more equitably among its people
and for the country’s sustainable development. If Burma prioritizes the
protection of peoples and the environment in extraction projects and
manages the revenues from the sale of its resources transparently, the
country’s non-renewable resources can be used sustainably for the
benefit of current and future generations, decreasing the pace and
need to extract resources from additional areas.
Mechanisms and systems for public disclosure of money flows,
independent revenue management and auditing, civil society input,
and equal benefit sharing currently exist in international standards of
revenue transparency and are put into practice in oil and gas producing
countries around the world. This report provides key lessons from
these countries that Burma can draw on to improve the management
of its oil and gas revenues and work toward ending its resource curse.";;;Arakan Oil Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;22-03-2012;en;"land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64502;http://burmalibrary.org/docs13/Burmas_Resource_Curse%28en%29-red.pdf;;;;

 especially 
 for

look at urbanism, we are as well to view from the perspectives of urban development along with 
urban planning. The buildings are merely the physical infrastructures for the citizens of Yangon 
but also
the cultural landscape and the history of the place. They have been changing throughout 
the time along with social and culture values of the local people. To be able to understand fully 
about the urban development of a certain area, 
attentive investigation on
urban planning
is 
mandatory. Thus, decent urban planning is vital for the positive development. This research report 
is based on the theories of urbanism, cultural diversity and tangible and intangible cultural heritage 
but focus mainly on tangible historic architectural buildings conservation. The case study is in the 
city of Yangon, Myanmar and critical analysis is centered on the Yangon Heritage Trust, the local 
NGO working on preserving the heritage of the city. The analysis themes are made upon th

OBL:64348;Contract Farming In Burma;;"Summary: Since 2005, the Burmese Government has encouraged
investors from China, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Kuwait to
invest in contract farms; to date, only the Thais have a
formal agreement to farm 120,000 acres along the Thai-Burma
border. Over the past six months, several Burmese companies
-- Tay Za's Htoo Trading, Zaw Zaw's Max Myanmar, Steven Law's
Asia World, and Aung Thet Mann's Aye Ya Shwe Wa -- were given
more than 100,000 acres of farmland in the Irrawaddy Delta
and Rangoon Division for contract farming. The Ministry of
Agriculture denies any land seizures associated with contract
farming, saying the government is the sole owner of farmland
and takes it away only if farmers do not use it for farming
purposes. According to agricultural contacts, the GOB
encourages contract farming because private investors help
shoulder the costs of improving Burma's dilapidated
agricultural infrastructure. There is no information on how
much the contract farming investments in Burma are worth.

OBL:44535;Navigating the Border: An Analysis of the China-Myanmar Timber Trade;;"Summary: China’s trade in timber products with Myanmar grew substantially from 1997-2002, from 295,474 m3
(round wood equivalent, RWE) in 1997 to 947,765 m3 (RWE) in 2002. Despite increased volume,
timber product imports from Myanmar comprised only 2.5% of China’s total timber product imports
from 1997-2002. However, the small fraction of total imports masks two important features: i)
timber imports from Myanmar are primarily logged in slow-growing natural forests in northern
Myanmar; and ii) logging activities that support the China-Myanmar timber trade are increasingly
concentrated along the border in northern Myanmar’s Kachin State. This greater concentration of
the timber trade has begun to have substantial ecological and socio-economic impacts within China’s
borders.
The majority of China’s timber product imports from Myanmar are shipped overland through
neighboring Yunnan Province – 88% of all imports from 1997-2002 according to China’s national
customs statistics. Of these, more than 75% of timber product inflows passed through the three
prefectures in northwest Yunnan that border Kachin State. Most of these logging activities are
currently concentrated in three areas — Pianma Township (Nujiang Prefecture), Yingjiang County
(Dehong Prefecture), and Diantan Township (Baoshan Municipality). Logging that sustains the
timber industry along Yunnan’s border with Kachin State is done by Chinese companies that are
operating in Myanmar but are based along the border in China. Logging activities in Kachin State,
from actual harvesting to road building, are almost all carried out by Chinese citizens.
Although the volume of China’s timber product imports from Myanmar is small by comparison, the
scale of logging along the border is considerable, and border townships and counties have become
over-reliant on the timber trade as a primary means of fiscal revenue. As the costs of logging in
Myanmar rise, this situation is increasingly becoming economically unsustainable, and shifts in the
timber industry will have significant implications for the future of Yunnan’s border region.
Importantly, a large proportion of logging and timber processing along the border is both managed
and manned by migrant workers. Because of companies’ and workers’ low level of embeddedness in
the local economy, border village communities are particularly vulnerable to swings in the timber
trade. More broadly, timber trade has done little to promote sustained economic growth along the
China-Myanmar border as profits, by and large, have not been redirected into local economies.
In addition to socio-economic pressures, the combination of insufficient regulation in China and
political instability in northern Myanmar has exacted a high ecological price. The uncertain regulatory
and contractual environment has oriented the border logging industry toward short-term harvesting
and profits, rather than investments in longer-term timber production. Degradation in Myanmar’s
border forests will have an impact on China’s forests, as wildlife, pest and disease management,
forest fire prevention and containment, and controlling natural disasters caused by soil erosion all
become increasingly difficult. While political reform in northern Myanmar is a precondition for improved regulation and
management of Myanmar’s forests, the Chinese government has a series of economic, trade, security
and environmental policy options that it could pursue to ensure its own ecological security and
enhance the socio-economic benefits of trade. Potential avenues explored in this analysis include: i)
promoting longer-term border trade and distributing benefits from the timber trade, ii) improving
border control and industry regulation, iii) enhancing environmental security and strengthening
environmental cooperation, and iv) exploring flexibility in the logging ban...

Introduction:

""By virtue of its geography (great river valleys, plains, plateaus and mountain chains) and history (migration and settlement along the rivers and in the uplands) Burma is a multicultural crossroads of Southeast and South Asia. Peoples, ways of life and religions from the Indian subcontinent, Himalayas, Indo-China and beyond, have intermingled in a land which became a nation under British colonization and has struggled with ethnic identities ever since. Although the vast majority of inhabitants are Buddhists, with the overwhelmingly Buddhist Burmans the largest ethnic group, nearly all other religions are represented in the population. Tolerance and cosmopolitanism were among Burma's strengths in times of peace.

Unfortunately, military rule and the promulgation of ethnic-majority nationalism have been in effect since General Ne Win's takeover in 1962, and even in the post-British democracy of U Nu, establishment of Buddhism as a state religion appeared to sideline Burma's people of other faiths. Ne Win's dictatorship favored the assimilation of Buddhist groups like the Rakhines, Mons and Shans into a Burman nationalism, discouraging those peoples' knowledge of their own languages, civilized history and cultures. Targeting Christians and Muslims, Ne Win's armed forces often burned churches and mosques, torturing and killing pastors and imams.

In western Burma's Arakan State (aka Rakhine State), military rule brought decreased rights for the Buddhist Rakhine people and absolute denial of citizenship for the Muslim Rohingya people. The mass exodus of Rohingyas fleeing repression to neighboring Bangladesh took place in 1978 and 1991, resulting in tens of thousands of refugees cordoned off in squalid camps in Bangladesh or permanently stranded overseas (Gulf States, Pakistan, Malaysia, India, Thailand.) As Rohingyas left the northern Arakan region, particularly Buthidaung and Maungdaw, out of fear of extreme repression, Burma's post-1988 junta settled Buddhist Rakhine and Burman villagers in the area -- a scenario guaranteed to make both groups resent each other. Rohingyas who remained were often preyed upon by border security forces and other military personnel, and were severely restricted in rights such as marriage and travel. Military rape and other violent victimization of Rohingyas was well-documented by respected international human rights organizations...";;;Project Maje;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;25-07-2012;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/63377;http://www.projectmaje.org/rohingya_2012.htm;;;;
OBL:57963;Internal Displacement and International Law in Eastern Burma;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
""Twenty years after the Burmese junta gunned down pro-democracy protesters, violations of human rights and humanitarian law in eastern Burma are more widespread and systematic than ever. Ten years after the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement were submitted, the international response in eastern Burma remains largely ineffective in dealing with a predatory governing regime.
The Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) has been collaborating with ethnic community-based organisations to document the characteristics of internal displacement in eastern Burma since 2002. During this period there has been increasing debate about whether violations of human rights and humanitarian law in eastern Burma constitute an international crime. So aside from updating information about the scale and distribution of internal displacement, this year's survey compiles abuses reported during 2008 in relation to the legal framework for crimes against humanity.Conflict-induced displacement remains most concentrated in the northern Karen areas, where armed skirmishes between the Burmese Army and the Karen National Union continued in the first six months of 2008. While the wet season was previously a time of respite from Burmese Army patrols, intensified troop deployments during the past couple of years mean that the occupation is now sustained all year. This has led to the displacement of 27,000 villagers in the four affected townships during the past year. The prevalence of military attacks targeting civilians has slightly decreased since the junta's offensive in 2006. However, the harassment of villagers perceived as sympathetic to the armed opposition is unrelenting.
The four townships surrounding Laikha in southern Shan State are also of particular concern. Armed skirmishes and Burmese Army deployments have escalated in this area since a former battalion commander with the Shan State Army - South surrendered in 2006. The Burmese Army is attempting to assert its supremacy in the area by breaking communication links between the armed opposition to the south and ceasefire groups to the north. Over 13,000 civilians are estimated to have been displaced from their homes in this area during the past twelve months.
TBBC has previously reported that more than 3,200 settlements were destroyed, forcibly relocated or otherwise abandoned in eastern Burma between 1996 and 2007. Such field reports have been corroborated by high resolution commercial satellite imagery of villages before and after the displacement occurred. During the past year, community organisations have documented the forced displacement of a further 142 villages and hiding sites.
However, displacement is more commonly caused by coercive factors at the household level. The imposition of forced labour, extortion, land confiscation, agricultural production quotas, and restrictions on access to fields and markets has a devastating effect on household incomes and a destabilising impact on populations. During the past year, the prevalence of these factors has been exacerbated by hydro-electric projects in Shan and Karen States, mining projects in Shan and Karenni States and Pegu Division, the gas pipeline in Mon State as well as commercial agriculture and road construction in general.While the total number of internally displaced persons in eastern Burma is likely to be well over half a million people, at least 451,000 people have been estimated in the rural areas alone. The population includes approximately 224,000 people currently in the temporary settlements of ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities. However, the most vulnerable group is an estimated 101,000 civilians who are hiding in areas most affected by military skirmishes, followed by approximately 126,000 villagers who have been forcibly evicted by the Burmese Army into designated relocation sites.
An estimated 66,000 people were forced to leave their homes as a result of, or in order to avoid, the effects of armed conflict and human rights abuses during the past year alone. Despite concessions made in the Irrawaddy Delta after Cyclone Nargis, the junta's restrictions on humanitarian access continue to obstruct aid workers elsewhere in Burma, particularly in conflict-affected areas. The large scale of displacement and the obstruction of relief efforts are indicative of ongoing violations of human rights and humanitarian law in eastern Burma.
International law recognises crimes against humanity as acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population. Attacks on civilians refer not only to military assaults but also to the multiple commission of acts such as murder, enslavement, forcible transfer of population, torture and rape when related to a State policy. This definition reflects customary international law binding on all states, including Burma. The evidence cited in this report appears to strengthen Amnesty International's recent assessment that the violations in eastern Burma meet the legal threshold to constitute crimes against humanity.
Skeptics argue that raising allegations about crimes against humanity will merely frustrate the promotion of political dialogue. However, just as the provision of humanitarian assistance should not be dependent upon political reform, humanitarian protection and the administration of justice should not be sacrificed to expedite political dialogue. The reality is that the authorities have consistently refused to enter into a serious discussion of these abuses with a view to putting a stop to them. The threat of prosecution may actually increase the leverage of the diplomatic community and provide an incentive for the governing regime to end the climate of impunity.
Given the impunity with which violations have been committed, and the Burmese junta's failure to implement recommendations formulated by relevant United Nations' bodies, the responsibility to protect shifts to the international community. The challenge remaining for the international community is to operationalise this responsibility in Burma and hold the junta to account.";;;The Border Consortium;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2008;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/57963;http://www.refworld.org/docid/4c7c9ba82.html;;;;

OBL:71205;LIMITS REVISITED - A review of the limits to growth debate;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
""Four and a half decades after the Club of Rome published its landmark report 
on 
Limits to Growth
, the study remains critical to our understanding of economic 
prosperity. This new review of the 
Limits
 debate has been written to mark the 
launch of the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Limits to Growth.
The 1972 report articulated for the first time the dynamic nature of our dependency 
on physical resources and on ecological systems. It illustrated the processes of 
‘overshoot and collapse’ that can occur when these limits are approached and 
suggested that, without a shift in direction, adverse consequences would become 
obvious “within the next century”. The report attracted fierce controversy. It also 
inspired generations of environmental and social thinkers. It continues to offer 
challenging insights into the predicaments of the 21st Century economy. 
Limits Revisited
 outlines the contents of the Club of Rome’s report, traces the 
history of responses to it and dispels some of the myths surrounding it. We 
unravel the arguments that have raged for forty years in its aftermath and explore 
more recent findings which relate to the original hypothesis. 
There is unsettling evidence that society is still following the ‘standard run’ of the 
original study – in which overshoot leads to an eventual collapse of production 
and living standards. Detailed recent studies suggests that production of some 
key resources may only be decades away. 
Certain other limits to growth – less visible in the 1972 report – present equally 
pressing challenges to modern society. We highlight, in particular, recent work on 
our proximity to ‘planetary boundaries’ and illustrate this through the challenge 
of meeting the Paris Agreement on climate change. We also explore the economic 
challenge of a ‘secular stagnation’. 
If the Club of Rome is right, the next few decades are decisive. One of the most 
important lessons from the study is that early responses are absolutely vital 
as limits are approached. Faced with these challenges, there is also clearly a 
premium on creating political space for change and developing positive narratives 
of progress. A part of the aim of the APPG is create that space";"Tim Jackson

OBL:67617;The Burma-China Pipelines: Human Rights Violations, Applicable Law, and Revenue Secrecy;;"...This briefer focuses on the impacts of two of Burma’s largest energy projects, led
by Chinese, South Korean, and Indian multinational corporations in partnership with the
state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), Burmese companies, and Burmese
state security forces. The projects are the Shwe Natural Gas Project and the Burma-China
oil transport project, collectively referred to here as the “Burma-China pipelines.” The
pipelines will transport gas from Burma and oil from the Middle East and Africa across
Burma to China. The massive pipelines will pass through two states, Arakan (Rakhine) and
Shan, and two divisions in Burma, Magway and Mandalay, over dense mountain ranges
and arid plains, rivers, jungle, and villages and towns populated by ethnic Burmans and
several ethnic nationalities. The pipelines are currently under construction and will feed
industry and consumers primarily in Yunnan and other western provinces in China, while

producing multi-billion dollar revenues for
the Burmese regime.
This briefer provides original research
documenting adverse human rights impacts
of the pipelines, drawing on investigations
inside Burma and leaked documents
obtained by EarthRights and its partners.
EarthRights has found extensive land
confiscation related to the projects, and a
pervasive lack of meaningful consultation
and consent among affected communities,
along with cases of forced labor and other
serious human rights abuses in violation of
international and national law. EarthRights
has uncovered evidence to support claims
of corporate complicity in those abuses.
In addition, companies involved have
breached key international standards and
research shows they have failed to gain a
social license to operate in the country.
New evidence suggests communities
in the project area are overwhelmingly
opposed to the pipeline projects. While
EarthRights has not found evidence directly
linking the projects to armed conflict,
the pipelines may increase tensions as
construction reaches Shan State, where
there is a possibility of renewed armed
conflict between the Burmese Army and
specific ethnic armed groups. The Army is
currently forcibly recruiting and training
villagers in project areas to fight.
EarthRights has obtained confidential
Production Sharing Contracts detailing
the structure of multi-million dollar
signing and production bonuses that China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
is required to pay to MOGE officials
regarding its involvement in two offshore
oil and gas development projects that,
at present, are unrelated to the Burma-
China pipelines. EarthRights believes the
amount and structure of these payments are
in-line with previously disclosed resource
development contracts in Burma, and are
likely representative of contracts signed
for the Burma-China pipelines; contracts
that remain guarded from public scrutiny.
Accordingly, the operators of the Burma-
China pipeline projects would have already
made several tranche cash payments to
MOGE, totaling in the tens of millions of
dollars...";;;EarthRights International;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;29-03-2011;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/67617;http://www.earthrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/the-burma-china-pipelines-korean.pdf;;;;

OBL:62626;Myanmar at the HLP Crossroads (final version);;"Executive Summary:
""Few issues are as frequently discussed and politically charged in transitional Myanmar as the state of housing, land and property (HLP) rights. The effectiveness of the laws and policies that address the fundamental and universal human need for a place to live, to raise a family, and to earn a living, is one of the primary criterion by which most people determine the quality of their lives and judge the effectiveness and legitimacy of their Governments. Housing, land and property issues undergird economic relations, and have critical implications for the ability to vote and otherwise exercise political power, for food security and for the ability to access education and health care.
As the nation struggles to build greater democracy and seeks growing engagement with the outside world, Myanmar finds itself at an extraordinary juncture; in fact, it finds itself at the HLP Crossroads. The decisions the Government makes about HLP matters during the remainder of 2012 and beyond, in particular the highly controversial issue of potentially transforming State land into privately held assets, will set in place a policy direction that will have a marked impact on the future development of the country and the day-to-day circumstances in which people live. Getting it right will fundamentally and positively transform the nation from the bottom-up and help to create a nation that consciously protects the rights of all and shows the true potential of what was until very recently one of the world's most isolated nations. Getting it wrong, conversely, will delay progress, and more likely than not drag the nation's economy and levels of human rights protections downwards for decades to come.
Myanmar faces an unprecedented scale of structural landlessness in rural areas, increasing displacement threats to farmers as a result of growing investment interest by both national and international firms, expanding speculation in land and real estate, and grossly inadequate housing conditions facing significant sections of both the urban and rural population. Legal and other protections afforded by the current legal framework, the new Farmland Law and other newly enacted legislation are wholly inadequate. These conditions are further compounded by a range of additional HLP challenges linked both to the various peace negotiations and armed insurgencies in the east of the country, in particular Kachin State, and the unrest in Rakhine State in the western region. The Government and people of Myanmar are thus struggling with a series of HLP challenges that require immediate, high-level and creative attention in a rights-based and consistent manner.
As the country begins what will be a long and arduous journey toward democratization, the rule of law and stable new institutions, laws and procedures, the time is ripe for the Government to work together with all stakeholders active within the HLP sector to develop a unique Myanmar- centric approach to addressing HLP challenges that shows the country's true potential. And it is also time for the Government to begin to take comprehensive measures - some quick and short-term, others more gradual and long-term - to equitably and intelligently address the considerable HLP challenges the country faces, and grounding these firmly within the reform process.Having thoroughly examined the de facto and de jure HLP situation in the country based on numerous interviews, reports and visits, combined with an exhaustive review of the entire HLP legislative framework in place in the country, this report recommends that the following four general measures be commenced by the Government of Myanmar before the end of 2012 to improve the HLP prospects of Myanmar:...";;;Displacement Solutions;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;25-10-2012;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land administration;land governance;security of tenure (land);land grabbing;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62626;http://burmalibrary.org/docs14/MYANMAR-AT-THE-HLP-CROSSROADS-full-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:58433;The Mekong Challenge - Underpaid, Overworked and Overlooked: The realities of young migrant workers in Thailand: Vol. 2 (3) - The Fishing Sector;;"Conclusions:
4.1 Indications of labour exploitation
The findings clearly show that being forced to work
is not uncommon in the fishing sector. About a fifth
of migrants have either previously experienced being
forced to work or are currently being forced to work.
Migrants working on fishing boats, female workers in
fish processing and children tend to experience forced
labour more than male workers in fish processing
and adult workers in general. The findings show
that employment aboard fishing vessels often means
working in extremely poor conditions, far worse than
those in the fish processing sector. It is no surprise
that migrant workers who are being forced to work
are more likely to end up working aboard fishing
boats. Being undocumented makes migrants even
more vulnerable to forced labour.
Physical and verbal abuse by employers is common
in the fishing sector, and alarmingly this seems to be
more commonly faced by child workers (aged under
15). While migrants work under poor conditions,
almost half of them feel they can't leave their job
because of certain constraints, mostly relating to fear
of arrest by the police. Migrants under 15 years of age
pointed to such constraints to a greater degree than
adult migrants. Somewhat surprisingly, registered
migrants feel there are more constraints preventing
them from leaving their current employment than
unregistered migrants. About two fifths of registered
migrants fear arrest by the authorities if they leave
their job. This implies that being registered does not
help all migrants feel any safer.
The fact that up to two thirds of registered migrants
do not have control over their documents explains
in part why registered migrants are still worried
about getting arrested. Keeping hold of the originals
of migrants' documents not only reflects a means
through which employers can prevent workers from
switching jobs, but it also highlights employers'
ignorance of the right migrants have to hold onto
their own documents. Some employers who keep
migrants' documents openly said they did not want
migrants to act, ""as if they were Thai nationals who
could independently go anywhere, or leave their jobs
if they are not happy with them"". This clearly shows
that many employers feel migrants should not be
treated the same as Thai nationals. It is consistent
with the results from the survey, which show that only
half of the employers surveyed agree that migrants
should have the same rights as Thai workers...
4.2 Legal status and registration
A migrant worker's legal status does not fully
guarantee his or her safety from exploitation at
the destination, however, it does, to a large extent,
reduce the possible scope of exploitation. Being
undocumented, for example, appears to increase the
chance that a migrant worker would be exploited at
work.
Studies reveal that compared to registered migrants,
unregistered (undocumented) migrant workers
tend to receive lower wages, work for longer hours,
start work earlier and have less rest time than their
documented counterparts. A far higher proportion of
migrants employed on fishing boats are unregistered
than those employed in fish processing. They live
and work in vulnerable conditions party because of
their undocumented status.
Although both employers and migrants in general
have positive attitudes regarding registration,
there are a number of difficulties. Migrants cross
the border into Thailand all the time, however,
the registration period is fixed. Therefore, hiring
undocumented migrants is still common since
employers need to hire workers and migrants are
readily available to work, no matter what their
legal status happens to be. Although arranging for
registration is the employers' responsibility, some
employers seem to be ignoring this important step.
As for migrants, it is not clear whether migrants
are fully aware that this step is the responsibility of

their employers. Nevertheless, knowing their rights
and the employer's responsibility does not guarantee
that migrants' rights will be fulfilled as the migrant
workers are unlikely to act without strong support
from the Thai government...
4.3 Working conditions
Most migrants work in very poor conditions. They
work for 12 hours on average, start working early,
even before 4 am on days when there is a heavy
workload, and almost half only get half an hour or
less break time per day. While almost 80% have
regular days off per month, less than a tenth are paid
for these days off. Given the nature of the work in
the fishing sector, it is understandable that some
migrants may need to start working very early,
however, working such long hours should be deemed
unacceptable, as should night work for children.
About a fifth of migrants work over 15 hours a day,
which is intolerable for a normal person.
As well as long working hours, evidently the minimum
wage is not commonly applied when hiring migrant
workers. In addition, if migrant labourers work for
more than eight hours a day, this does not guarantee
they receive wages at a rate above the minimum.
More than half the migrant workers who work for
more than eight hours a day still receive less than
the minimum wage. Migrant workers employed on
fishing boats receive particularly low rates of pay.
Most jobs for migrant workers in the fishing sector
are insecure due to variable work schedules and pay
methods, such as profit-based systems or piece rates.
Most migrant workers are treated the same as casual
workers with no benefits.
Migrants employed on fishing boats clearly work
in inferior conditions, in nearly all aspects, when
compared with migrants employed in fish processing.
Jobs on fishing boats are less attractive than in fish
processing factories because the nature of work is
tough, dangerous and it is lonely being far away
from family. Fishing boat employers explained that
they often had to take desperate steps to try and
recruit workers, despite offering incentives, such
as payments in advance. Despite such incentives,
it still seems as though jobs aboard fishing vessels
are the ""last resort"" for migrant workers. In light of
this, migrants working aboard fishing vessels may
be those who have nowhere else to go, or those who
have fewer job opportunities, such as unregistered
migrants or child workers. This could easily force
these workers into more vulnerable situations than
other migrant workers...
4.4 Child labour
Most of the children in this survey seem to be working
under the ""worst forms"" of child labour. Work on
fishing boats by its very nature may be considered a
worst form and therefore should not be performed by
children under the age of 17 years in accordance with
ILO Convention 182.
In fish processing, where children work for long hours
or start before 6am, this might also be considered
a worst form of child labour. Otherwise, under
regulated conditions, children aged 15 and over
may work in fish processing factories. Addressing
the worst forms of child labour in the fishing sector
needs an immediate response. Migrants under the
age of 15 made up 15% of the fishing sample despite
the fact that this contravenes Thai labour law (and
the ILO Convention 138 on Minimum Age which
Thailand has ratified).
Although very few employers openly admit they prefer
to employ children, employers implicitly expressed
a preference to hire children because they are fast
workers, obedient and cheaper than adult migrants.
While employers see the benefits of hiring younger
migrants, they do not fully see the responsibilities.
Some employers do not view child workers as ""real""
workers, but more as children simply helping out
their parents. However, the migrant survey clearly
shows children are not simply acting in support roles.
In fishing, children are working even longer hours
than adult workers whilst receiving less support and
lower pay...

4.5 Support mechanisms
At destination, family and relatives are central
support figures for most migrants, this is especially
the case for child workers and migrants employed in
fish processing. Migrants employed on board fishing
boats depend more on their workmates and friends
and less on family members and relatives. This is due
to the unique physical environment of working on
fishing boats and spending long periods at sea.
Attaining a better education may help reduce the risk
for migrants of being trafficked. However, migrant
children have few prospects to attend school while
working in Thailand given their long daily working
hours. Very few migrants currently attend school
and less than a fifth of migrants reported that their
employers permit child workers to attend school.
In Thailand, part of a solution to address the
isolation facing migrants has been for NGOs to tap
into and strengthen migrants' sense of community.40
However, very few migrants working in the fishing
sector currently participate in any type of group in
their community. Encouraging migrants to be part
of a community organization might be worth further
exploration because most migrants express an interest
in joining a group or club, particularly with regard
to the subject of health issues.";;;International Labour Organisation;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;13-12-2006;en;farmers;;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/58433;http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/child/trafficking/downloads/vol2-fishing-thai.pdf;;;;

""The Eastern Himalayan Alpine Shrub and Meadows [PA1003] represent the alpine scrub and meadow habitat along the Inner Himalayas to the east of the Kali Gandaki River in central Nepal. Within it are the tallest mountains in the world-Everest, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, and Jomalhari-which tower far above the Gangetic Plains. The alpine scrub and meadows in the eastern Himalayas are nested between the treeline at 4,000 m and the snowline at about 5,500 m and extend from the deep Kali Gandaki gorge through Bhutan and India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, to northern Myanmar.
 The Eastern Himalayan Alpine Shrub and Meadows [PA1003] ecoregion supports one of the world's richest alpine floral displays that becomes vividly apparent during the spring and summer when the meadows explode into a riot of color from the contrasting blue, purple, yellow, pink, and red flowers of alpine herbs. Rhododendrons characterize the alpine scrub habitat closer to treeline. The tall, bright-yellow flower stalk of the noble rhubarb, Rheum nobile (Polygonaceae), stands above all the low herbs and shrubs like a beacon, visible from across the valleys of the high Himalayan slopes.

The plant richness in this ecoregion sitting at the top of the world is estimated at more than 7,000 species, a number that is three times what is estimated for the other alpine meadows in the Himalayas. In fact, from among the Indo-Pacific ecoregions, only the famous rain forests of Borneo are estimated to have a richer flora. Within the species-rich landscape are hotspots of endemism, created by the varied topography, which results in very localized climatic variations and high rainfall, enhancing the ability of specialized plant communities to evolve.

OBL:72035;Unleashing the potential of community forest enterprises in Myanmar;;"... Unleashing the potential of community forest (CF) enterprise in Myanmar is crucial for two main reasons. First, it will increase local incomes and government revenues, which will reduce poverty. Second, the financial incentive of such enterprises will encourage local people to manage and restore forests. Without enlisting the help of rural communities in these efforts it is likely that forest loss will continue and the contribution of forests to the rural economy will continue to decline.

The rate of forest loss in Myanmar is among the highest in the world, running at 0.9 per cent per year between 2000 and 2010. The forest sector’s importance to the overall
economy has declined in this time, from 0.6 per cent in 2006-2007 to 0.38 per cent in 2010-2011. Myanmar’s overall economy is now beginning to grow but at least 26 per cent
of the population remain in poverty – mostly in rural areas. Turning this around will require the development of new economic opportunities in rural areas, of which community forest enterprises are a critical part.

A number of immediate steps are needed to develop community forest enterprise opportunities. Forest legislation should allow communities commercial-use rights for both timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Government and civil society should work together to raise community awareness of these commercial enterprise opportunities, and a market-led approach to community forestry be pursued. The handover of local forests to Forest User Groups (FUGs) should be streamlined and accelerated. A working group of government extension staff and civil society groups should share experiences and expand capacity-building for FUGs in business management. Organisation between community FUGs should be encouraged, through local associations and regional and national federations. A reliable investment environment should be assured to facilitate enterprise development.

Field research from four states presented in this report highlights particularly promising community forestry enterprise opportunities. Bamboos appear to be the highest-priority product for enterprise development in the Ayeyarwady Delta, with timber (and potentially timber poles) and charcoal taking the second and third positions respectively. In the Mandalay Region, bamboo has the highest potential for enterprise development, with
timber and value-added bamboos taking the second and the third positions respectively. In Shan State, thatch appears to have the highest potential, followed by value-added
bamboos and bamboo. Finally, in Kachin State, timber appears to be the best option, with medicinal plants and firewood coming in at second and third.

Overall – and despite some significant regional differences – our analysis points to three major sectors for CF enterprise development: timber (including poles and posts), bamboo (including both unprocessed and processed products) and NTFPs – particularly medicinal and ornamental plants. There are also many miscellaneous products with great potential for CF enterprises, such as charcoal, rattan, agarwood, thanaka, elephant foot yam, white viii www.iied.org yam and so on. These can be integrated successfully as agricultural crops along with forest trees in the CF areas. This analysis clearly challenges the current monopoly on timber production by government agencies and ‘crony’ companies.

Progress towards the government’s Forest Master Plan target of 918,000 hectares of community forestry by 2030 is drastically behind, in part because local communities
do not perceive clearly the economic opportunity outlined. But even this target (2.8 per cent of the total forest area in Myanmar) is extraordinarily unambitious. A much more
reasonable ambition might be a government target of allocating 25 per cent of the total area of Myanmar forest to communities – matching roughly the global average for forest controlled by local groups. Doing this by 2030 could make six million people forest user group members, which would make community forestry a genuine engine of rural
economic growth. We outline some of the forest products upon which such community forestry enterprises might be based, and recommend regional clustering to improve scale
efficiencies and competitiveness.

A number of key challenges were found to underpin the slow development of community forest enterprises. The report explores each and proposes a solution. There is weak
political commitment to community forestry, and this requires more vigorous mobilisation and awareness-raising of its economic potential. Forest officers tend to lack interest in community forestry enterprise, when in fact it should be mainstreamed into the Forest Department’s normal operation procedures under a dedicated department. Tenure and use rights to commercial land and its resources are insecure, requiring the enactment and implementation of a national land-use policy and plan that grants community forest user groups (CFUGs) commercial forest use rights. The shortage of investment requires more accessible bank loans, membership saving schemes, supplier-buyer partnerships, insurance schemes and a further simplification of export requirements. A widespread lack
of business skills among communities requires more extensive training, workshops and exchange visits. The lack of technology requires concerted research and development
by government and academic institutions. Weak community participation in turn requires better mobilisation and awareness-raising of financial opportunities.

Business and financial-support services will need to be strengthened to bring about this transformation. But the market-led approach to community forestry fits perfectly
with the government of Myanmar’s new emphasis on support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), spearheaded by the president. SMEs constitute the largest sector within Myanmar’s economy in terms of number, contribution to employment, output and investment – playing a vital role in the country’s economic development. Community forestry enterprises could make a vital contribution to such development. But it will require concerted effort and a strong partnership between government and civil society groups to install a market-led approach to community forestry...";"Kyaw Tint

OBL:72037;Constraints and Opportunities for Commercial Timber Extraction From Community and Smallholder Forests;;"... The National Community Forestry Instruction (1995) provides communities the opportunity for 30 year licenses to manage state forests lands for natural forest protection, mixed agro-forestry and timber production systems. The Forestry Master Plan (2001) envisions around 920,000 ha to be handed to local Forest User Groups (FUGs) by 2030, about 1.36% of the total land area.

A recent review of community forestry (CF) conducted in 2011 identified a range of constraints to allowing individual CFs to “fulfil their potential”, and to scaling up the handover of CF to better meet the 2001 Forestry Master Plan targets. The review focused mostly on the institutional and technical impediments but also clearly identified the need for the scope of CF to shift from “subsistence to enterprise” and integrate “timber harvesting on a significantly larger scale”.

Since 2008, FFI Myanmar and its partners have been actively supporting the establishment of CF as a tool for watershed protection, protected area buffer zone establishment and livelihood development. To date FFI has assisted over 50 communities with CF establishment, provided small grants and technical assistance to a further 30 CF groups, and conducted CF training for state and regional level civil society groups.

FFI’s current strategic plan includes: i) The continued development of CF models to become self-funding, and ii) Evidence-based advocacy to streamline the CF application procedure. The long-term sustainability of CF in Myanmar may not be clear for some years, as even the oldest commercial CF trees are only 15 years old, but CF seems to offer considerable potential to provide a supply of timber and therefore generate substantial revenues for local communities.

The current reforms in the Myanmar forest sector and the EU FLEGT initiative are providing an unprecedented opportunity to clarify community rights over CF timber and by doing so to promote the expansion and sustainability of CF.

This report was prepared under an FFI project supported by the FAO/EU FLEGT Support Programme, which promotes the implementation of the FLEGT Action Plan by improving forest governance, providing technical assistance, and building capacity through funding projects in eligible countries...";;;Myanmar Conservation and Development Program (MCDP);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2014;en;"land policies;security of tenure (land);community forestry;land law;forest land;land tenure systems";"Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72037;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/Constraints_%26_Opportunities_for_Commercial_Timber_Extraction_From_Community_and_Smallholder_Forests.pdf;;;;
OBL:72036;Democratising Timber: An Assessment of Myanmar's Emerging 'Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade' (FLEGT) Process;;"... This paper attempts to analyse the key aspects of reforms required to ‘democratise’ Myanmar's timber trade, and the political–economic interests contributing or obstructing reform. The main aim of this paper is to assess the prospects for reform of Myanmar's timber sector in light of theemerging FLEGT process, and to apply a political ecological analysis to the ways in which the political–economic power balance will determine the outcomes. We use aspects of political–ecological analysis to understand the nature and dynamics of the contested reform process: firstly structural explanations for the ways in which different groups gain access to resources — in this case forests and timber, andwho gains and loses through these processes; and secondly, a critical analysis of how polices relate to the exercise of power and practices on the ground. (Springate-Baginski and Blaikie, 2007: 10).

Methodologically, the often opaque and generally illicit nature of Myanmar's present timber trade makes primary data collection extremely difficult, even hazardous. There is also limited government data, and what there is, is systematically misleading (EIA, 2014). Therefore for this overview paper we necessarily rely on secondary sources
and anonymous interviews (conducted in Spring 2013), along with the personal experience of the authors.

Communal Land Tenure in Myanmar.....""...The objectives of the study were to identify legal ways using the Farmland Law 2012 and
Association Law 2014 to protect through land registration the untitled agricultural uplands,
including the fallows of upland shifting cultivation that are possessed by ethnic nationalities
that manage their lands under customary communal tenure. The risk of possible alienation of
the fallows through agribusiness concessions posed by the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Lands
Management Law, 2012 (VFV) spurred the study. Customary communal rights in Myanmar are
enforceable by customary law in areas, where no outside interference takes place. In the future
it may be given a legal backing in statutory law, if the intentions of the draft Land Use Policy
of mid 2015 are operationalised ensuring equity in access to land and protection of upland
cultures and livelihood.
Customary land management of rotating fallow agriculture or shifting cultivation constitutes
land management at the landscape level. It secures preservation of cultural identity and in most
places it establishes access rights of all resident villagers to shares of the land and leaves no one
landless. Rotational fallow management is an institutionalized resource management technology
at a species, ecosystem, and landscape level, ensuring ecological security and food security
and providing a social safety net. Fallows are important for wildlife and biodiversity, for production
of non timber forest products, for watershed hydrology, and for carbon sequestration.
Communal tenure can provide security of tenure as well as the institutional mechanisms for
future sustainable land use planning and climate change mitigation initiatives.
The study has focused on cultivated and fallow land in the uplands. It did not include a study
of customary communal tenure of forests and grazing lands. A customary land registration of
these ecosystems so far would need to be pursued under different laws. The study has covered
only the customary communal tenure of rotating fallow agriculture in Chin State and the more
permanent land combined with shifting cultivation use in Northern Shan State. A major limitation
of the study has been the fieldwork’s short duration...";Kirsten Ewers Andersen;;Land Core Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;19-02-2016;en;"customary law;customary tenure;land use;land grabbing;security of tenure (land);land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72496;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/Andersen_K.E._2016-02-Communal_tenure_in_Chin_and_Shan_States-corr.pdf;;;;

At the time of writing there are an estimated 640,747 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Myanmar, and 415,373 refugees originating from the country.However, these figures are not fully indicative of levels of forced migration, as obtaining reliable data for IDPs remains difficult, while millions of regular and irregular migrants have also left the country, often fleeing similar conditions to those faced by documented refugees and IDPs.
Since a new government came into power in 2011, it has managed to secure fresh ceasefire agreements with the majority of the country’s ethnonationalist armed groups (EAGs), potentially inching one step closer to a lasting solution for the country’s hundreds of thousands of refugees and IDPs. As the possibility for voluntary return and resettlement of displaced people opens up, there is a lot to learn from a look back at past ceasefire periods in Myanmar where movements of such populations have taken place.

OBL:75918;Dilemmas of Burma in transition;;"Until a government of Burma is able to accept the role of non-state armed groups as providers for civilian populations and affords them legitimacy within a legal framework, sustained conflict and mass displacement remain inevitable.

Throughout decades of brutal conflict, which have seen thousands of villages destroyed and millions of people displaced, Burma’s ruling regime has made no effort to provide support for affected civilians. As a result, Burma’s ethnic non-state armed groups (NSAGs) – thought to hold territory covering a quarter of the country’s landmass – play a crucial role as protectors and providers of humanitarian aid.

The approach to governance taken by different NSAGs varies greatly, as does the level of willing support given to them by their respective populations. In these traditional cultures, hierarchical leadership structures have evolved over time, often based largely on loyalty to those who provide support and protection. Leaders linked to or part of NSAGs are now firmly established as being responsible for the governance of millions of people in Burma.

OBL:65919;Kachin Rapid Assessment |1;;"Executive Summary: ""The instability in Kachin and Shan States that started in
early June 2011 has resulted in the displacement of
populations, loss of lives and livelihoods and damages
to infrastructure. The Kachin State government, local
and community]based organizations have been providing
some assistance to the displaced since the outset of
the conflict. International organizations have been
providing limited assistance through support to local
and community]based organizations, while continuing
to advocate for humanitarian assistance to be provided
to all civilians in need.
Following a Government invitation, a rapid needs assessment
was conducted in 39 locations in some areas
of five townships: Bhamo, Momauk, Myitkyina,
Khaunglanhpu and Waingmaw, and targeted 5,925
internally displaced persons (IDPs). Two townships ]
Mansi and Shwegu ] could not be assessed due to security
reasons. Of the total assessed population, the assessment
findings indicate that 57% are female and
56% under]18. The IDPs are temporarily residing in
community buildings, temporary camps/shelters or
with host families. Most of the IDPs are located in urban
areas, while those in rural areas are primarily being
sheltered by host families. While the number of
IDPs is fluctuating on a daily basis, the assessment
found that a large majority of those assessed ] 4,026 ]
has been displaced for over two months. Among people
with special needs the survey identified 70 unaccompanied
minors, 196 female] or child]headed households,
40 chronically ill and 36 persons with disabilities.
In general, due to the easier accessibility and the presence
of a larger number of aid agencies, the IDPs in
Myitkyina and Waingmaw have been receiving more
assistance than those in Bhamo and Momauk. Access
and delivery of assistance for many of the locations
continue to be a major challenge, particularly in the
southern townships of Bhamo, Momauk, Mansi and
Shwegu given the security situation and damage to
infrastructure, including access routes.
Living conditions, particularly in larger temporary
camps/shelters and community buildings where the
population density is high, are challenging. The assessment
found that 20 of the 39 surveyed locations are in
urgent need of additional shelter assistance. Temporary
camps/shelters would need to be upgraded with
improved roofing, more durable and safer shelters,
additional numbers of tents to lessen the population
density, allocation of cooking spaces and relocation of
latrines further away from the living quarters. These
measures would make the temporary camps/shelters
healthier and safer for children and women. IDPs in
community buildings such as churches and community
halls also suffer from over]population and the resulting
lack of adequate sleeping space as well as lack of privacy
for families.
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY While some non]food items (NFIs) have been provided
by the Government and local and community]based
organizations, to date, most of the IDPs require additional
NFI support, including plastic sheeting, cooking
utensils, blankets and clothes. These needs are most
urgent in Bhamo and Momauk.
Over half of IDPs in temporary camps/shelters and
community buildings are facing food access issues.
While food assistance has temporarily alleviated concern
over immediate food shortages in over half of the
locations that reported food access difficulties, a number
of camps have yet to receive food assistance. The
food security situation in Khaunglanhpu]La Jar camp in
Khaunglanhpu and AungThar Baptist Church in Bhamo
is of concern, and food assistance should be considered.
People staying in host families in Momauk, in
Momauk Baptist Church and 3]mile Kachin Baptist
Church in Bhamo are experiencing lack of food stocks,
and the food security situation in these locations would
need to be explored further. Overall, the IDPs indicated
a need for more diversified food assistance, which
should be explored given the reported observable malnutrition
in the locations assessed. The assessment
suggests that the nutritional status of children needs to
be further investigated.
While access to water for domestic and hygiene uses is
sufficient, availability of drinking water is an issue, with
only 40% of IDPs having access to sufficient quantities
of safe drinking water. The issue is particularly critical
in Bhamo where all locations reported insufficient access
to drinking water. Latrine use is wide]spread and
aid agencies have provided basic sanitary facilities in
all temporary camps/shelters and community buildings.
However, some of the locations with larger number of
IDPs need more latrines. Some latrines would need to
be upgraded for sanitary and safety reasons. Hygiene
promotion would be needed in a majority of the assessed
locations, along with provision of hygiene items.
There has been no report of disease outbreak or mortality
cases since June 2011 in surveyed locations. Over
half of the sites currently have access to health care
services provided by basic health staff, while the others
Kachin Rapid Assessment |1 5
in 14 locations only receive minimal health support
through community health workers. Measles immunization
campaign is needed in 31 locations, where a
limited number of under]2 children has records of having
had measles vaccination. Bed nets are needed in a
majority of the locations. Essential medical supplies
are needed in 35 out of the 39 locations.
Some 1,055 primary school children and 1,249 secondary
to high school children were identified amongst
the assessed IDPs. Primary school children in all locations
have access to varying degree of schooling support
] either access to nearby school facilities or to
temporary learning spaces ] which they regularly attend.
However, only a few secondary and high school
children seem to attend school, due to lack of access
and their contribution to household chores, particularly
in the absence of household heads.
Education materials are in short supply at all locations.
Temporary learning spaces are not sufficiently
equipped. A majority of the schools do not have adequate
water and sanitation facilities. Early Childhood
Development (ECD) centers have been established in
six locations, benefiting 201 or 20% of all under]five

12.5% of households are either female] or childheaded.
This points to the need for preventative measures
to mitigate potential risk factors. Extra measures
for ensuring the safety of women and children would
need to be taken, particularly in the temporary camps/
shelters, including improved lighting at night, separate
bathing spaces and latrines for men and women and
appointment of security focal points.

OBL:100318;A Comprehensive Plan Addressing the Needs of Displaced Persons on the Thailand/ Myanmar (Burma) Border in 2007/8;;"Introduction: ""1.1 This ‘Comprehensive Plan Addressing the Needs
 of Displaced Persons on the Thailand/Myanmar 
(Burma) Border in 2007/8’ has been prepared by t
he Committee for the Coordination of Services to 
Displaced Persons in Thailand (CCSDPT) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) Regional Office in Bangkok...
1.2 The first CCSDPT/ UNHCR Comprehensive Plan was for 2006 and was drawn up through a participatory 
process during 2005. It was presented to the Royal Thai
 Government (RTG) at a workshop in December that 
year. The 2006 plan was then expanded for 2006/ 7 and presented to Donors at a Donor Forum in May 2006 
also attended by the National Security Counc
il (NSC) and the Ministry of Interior (MOI)...
1.3 The Comprehensive Plan for 2007/8 draws on the earlier 
processes but this time also incorporates inputs 
from UNHCR’s Strengthening Protection Capacity Projec
t-Thailand (SPCP-Thailand). This was initiated in 
August 2006 and is another gap ident
ification exercise aimed at impr
oving the protection capacity of 
Thailand to receive and protect refugees, enhance t
heir means of self-reliance and expand opportunities for 
durable solutions...
1.4 The result is a more complete document whic
h summarises current protection and humanitarian 
assistance services in 2007, anticipat
ed services in 2008 and gaps identif
ied in each sector. For many of the 
most important gaps, specific project propo
sals with budget estimates are appended...
1.5 Implementation of the Comprehensive Plan will 
require ongoing cooperation between all stakeholders 
Specific challenges requiring action to move the pl
an forward are set out for CCSDPT/ UNHCR, the Donors 
and the RTG...";;;CCSDPT and UNHCR;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2007;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/100318;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/CCSDPT%26UNHCR-2008-A_Comprehensive_Plan_Addressing_the_Needs_of_Displaced_Persons_on_Thailand_Myanmar_Border-en-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:63962;Uncertain Ground: Landmines in eastern Burma;;"Analysis of KHRG's field information gathered between January 2011 and May 2012 in seven geographic research areas indicates that, during that period, new landmines were deployed by government and non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in all seven research areas. Ongoing mine contamination in eastern Burma continues to put civilians' lives and livelihoods at risk and undermines their efforts to protect against other forms of abuse. There is an urgent need for humanitarian mine action that accords primacy to local protection priorities and builds on the strategies villagers themselves already employ in response to the threat of landmines. In the cases where civilians view landmines as a potential source of protection, there is an equally urgent need for viable alternatives that expand self-protection options beyond reliance on the use of mines. Key findings in this report were drawn based upon analysis of seven themes, including: New use of landmines; Movement restrictions resulting from landmines; Marking and removal of landmines; Forced labour entailing increased landmine risks; Human mine sweeping, forced mine clearance and human shields; Landmine-related death or injury; and Use of landmines for self-protection.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;21-05-2012;en;"mining;land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/63962;http://burmalibrary.org/KHRG/KHRG%202012/KHRG-2012-05-Uncertain_Ground_Landmines_in_eastern_Burma-en.pdf;;;;

The report analyzed specific barriers impeding their success, from weak land policy and inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms, to an absence of support from various sources. While ""Disputed Territory"" explored the broad spectrum of land right violations among Mon communities, our current report focuses more specifically on the progress, or lack thereof, in cases of military land confiscation. In this regard, over a year has passed and yet Mon farmers continue to find themselves in a fruitless struggle. New details of past and on-going unjust military land acquisition continue to be brought to HURFOM and other media outlets, on the one hand proving that Burma’s political climate has become a safer space for victims to petition their rights, while on the other hand showing that significant challenges continue to preclude true justice for housing land and property (HLP) rights violations. Since the release of ""Disputed Territory"", and addressing one of the barriers to justice it highlighted, Mon farmers have gained greater access to education regarding their HLP rights, and are more aware of procedural requirements for landholders under the 2012 land laws.

Farmers have learned their lessons from the past, changed their strategy in fighting for their rights, but the results remain the same. Building on previous analysis, HURFOM contends that continuing barriers to progress lie primarily in the country’s broken land management system, the failures of recent land laws to secure the protection of farmers’ land rights, the failure of government bodies and authorities to perform their responsibilities unbiased from military influence, and the total impunity of the military due to the independent structure of the courts-martial.

OBL:46142;Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2002-03: Internally Displaced People and Forced Relocation;;"The situation of internally displaced people (IDPs), in Burma remained critical throughout 2002. The U.S. State Department’s country report for 2002 on Burma estimated that forced relocations had produced hundreds of thousands of refugees, with as many as one million internally displaced persons.

""Throughout 2002 the military continued to forcibly relocate minority villages, especially in areas where ethnic activists and rebels were active, and in areas targeted for the development of international tourism."" (Human Rights Watch World Report 2003)

In 2002, Human Rights Watch reported that tens of thousands of villagers in the ethnic insurgent areas remained in forced relocation sites or were internally displaced. It has been estimated that in 2002 around 170 villages have been burned down and 300 villages have been forced to relocate, in the Karen area alone. (Source: UN Wire) The most significant displacement has occurred in the border ethnic areas where the military regime has been at war with ethnic armed opposition groups for over 50 years. Ethnic minorities such as the Muslim Rohingyas of Arakan State, the Shan, Karen, Kachin and the Karenni, as well other smaller ethnic groups that live in the same areas have suffered disproportionately. Whatever their background, internally displaced persons in Burma live under conditions of severe deprivation and hardship. Almost all are without adequate access to food or basic health and education services. A large number of IDPs are women and children.

People in Burma become displaced as a result of SPDC policies that either directly or indirectly compel them to leave their homes. Villagers are subject to forced relocation by the SPDC as part of the military’s four-cuts program; for urban resettlement or ""beautification"" projects, which are often linked to the SPDC’s campaigns to promote tourism; and for rural resettlement programs. People are also frequently left with no choice but to flee their home villages when faced with resource scarcity, and the loss of their security and livelihoods that result from oppressive SPDC policies. Economic reasons for fleeing include: numerous demands for forced labor and portering; government crop quotas; ceaseless taxes and fees to support the army; army looting or destruction of property; and uncompensated loss of land or property due to SPDC development projects. Even more pressing are people’s fears of the torture, rape, arbitrary arrest and arbitrary killings perpetuated in border areas by the military. Finally, villagers also often flee in anticipation of forced relocation...";;;Human Rights Documentation Unit (National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2003;en;"local community;displacement";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/46142;http://burmalibrary.org/docs/Yearbook2002-3/yearbooks/13.%20Internally%20Displaced%20People%20and%20Forced%20Relocation.htm;;;;
OBL:46140;Landmine chapter of the Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2002-2003;;"Anti-personnel landmines are victim-activated weapons that indiscriminately kill and maim civilians, soldiers, elderly people, women, children and animals. They can cause injury and death long after the end of hostilities. In Asia, Burma is currently second only to Afghanistan in the number of new landmine victims, surpassing even Cambodia. Contrary to trends in the rest of the world, the SPDC has not signed the Mine Ban Treaty and abstained from the 1999 UN General Assembly vote on the treaty. Of Burma’s 14 states and divisions, 9 of them are affected by landmines. Evidence suggests that in Karen State there is one landmine victim everyday. Civilians become landmine victims in two ways: when they are forced by the military to act as human minesweepers (see below); and when they accidentally step on mines planted in areas where civilians reside. More than 14 percent of mine victims in Burma stepped on landmines within half a kilometer from the center of their village.

In efforts to block supply routes for armed ethnic organizations, the SPDC plants mines on supply and escape routes used by villagers and refugees. Villages from which people have fled or have been forcibly relocated from are also mined to prevent the villagers from returning, as well as to block access to food, supplies and intelligence to opposition groups. Landmines have also been planted along streams, paths, roads and passes that are used by civilians, including those fleeing Burma. It is estimated that there is one civilian death for every two military casualties associated with landmines.

OBL:46141;Burma Human Rights Yearbook 2002-2003: The Situation of Refugees;;"According to the US Committee for Refugees, there are more than 450,000 Burmese refugees and asylum seekers in countries neighboring Burma. Driven out by the ruling military regimes unrelenting policies and practices that violate their human rights, refugees and aylum seekers have fled to Thailand, Bangladesh, India and Malaysia. The human rights abuses committed by the SPDC include forced relocations, rape, forced labor, torture, the confiscation of land and property, arbitrary arrest and lack of personal security. As the SPDC continues to try and eliminate all resistance forces, particularly in ethnic areas, they attempt to expand military control over the population through mass forced relocation programs. There are currently over 1 million internally displaced people who have the potential to become cross-border refugees in times of increased military conflict.

In Thailand, there are over 144,000 refugees, the majority of whom are from Karen, Karenni, Mon, and Shan ethnic groups. At the same time, there are more than 1 million migrant workers in Thailand who flee to Thailand for many of the same reasons as refugees. A new trend is more ethnic Burmese leaving Burma from both urban and rural areas in family groups. They usually become migrant workers and leave Burma due to forced labor, heavy taxation, corruption, inability to maintain an adequate standard of living and interference with their livelihood through the theft or confiscation of land, property and livestock.

In 1992 over 250,000 Rohingyas fled religious persecution in Arakan State to take refuge in Bangladesh. While most have been repatriated, there are still over 21,500 Rohingya refugees in the two remaining refugee camps as well as over 100,000 who are living and working among the Bangladeshi communities. Rohingyas have also fled to Malaysia while the refugee population in India consists mostly of Chin people.

The Refugee Convention states that refugee protection rests on the principle of non-refoulement, which dictates that no refugee should be returned to any country where he or she is likely to face persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. This principle has been repeatedly violated by the governments of Bangladesh, India and Thailand, who continue to forcibly repatriate refugees back to areas where their safety cannot be guaranteed...";;;Human Rights Documentation Unit (National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2003;en;displacement;Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/46141;http://burmalibrary.org/docs/Yearbook2002-3/yearbooks/14.%20The%20Situation%20of%20Refugees.htm;;;;

OBL:101277;Dealing with displacement in Myanmar’s peace process (Working Paper).;;"Executive Summary:
""Myanmar has been engaged in a process of political change since 2011. A central goal of these reforms 
has been the attempt to resolve political conflicts between ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) and the 
Myanmar Government. Talks began under the ‘civilian
government’ led by Thein Sein and have continued 
under the National League of Democracy (NLD)
-
led Government. However, several years of talks have 
produced little concrete progress. 
This is a complex peace process, which has only the partial inclusion 
of Myanmar’s many ethnic armed 
organisations and which is being conducted in a climate of continuing conflict and state violence and 
continuing tensions between the Burman majority and other ethnic groups. This is evident in large
-
scale 
displacement from R
akhine State (where more than 300,000 refugees fled to Bangladesh in September 
2017) and in Kachin and northern Shan States (where more than 119,000 people have been displaced since 
2011). There is also an urgent emerging problem of large

scale development
and land acquisition projects 
creating further displacement. 
It is important not to be naïve about the scale of the challenges in Myanmar’s peace process, or indeed 
about the possibility that the peace process may break down entirely. However, it is a
lso valuable to 
consider what would be required to maximise the chances of a successful peace process. There is no 
formula to determine why some peace processes work while others fail, but the chances of building a 
sustainable peace are substantially enhan
ced when the process genuinely engages with and seeks to 
correct the inequalities and injustice that gave rise to conflict. For Myanmar, that must include addressing 
the causes and consequences of displacement
. 
This working paper sets out the context an
d experience of displacement in and from Myanmar. It identifies 
a number of areas that must be addressed, 
including:
-
The process of drafting a peace agreement, and displacement
-
specific provisions to include in a 
peace agreement; 
-
The timing, design and implementation of return and reintegration of displaced populations; 
-
Wider issues of legal protection, land governance and restitution. 
The working paper also identifies some cross
-
cutting themes, including the need to recognise a
relationship 
between displacement and other aspects of peacebuilding (such as political autonomy for ethnic areas and 
land governance); the necessity of ensuring that displaced people themselves are central to the process of 
policy design, ideally through
institutionalised mechanisms for dialogue, consultation and representation; 
and the importance of securing continued funding to support refugees and IDPs with a continuing need of 
international protection...";Kirsten Mcconnachie;;Political Settlements Research Programme;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-08-2017;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/101277;http://www.politicalsettlements.org/files/2017/09/201709_WP_McConnachie_Myanmar-Executive-Summary.pdf;;;;

OBL:60097;HUMAN SETTLEMENTS SECTOR REVIEW, UNION OF MYANMAR;;"The oft-cited UN Habitat report on the 1989-1990 urban resettlement programme in Burma which the report estimates affected 1.5 million people (16 percent of the urban population). ""...During the early months of 1990 international attention was focused on
the Yangon squatter clearance and resettlement programme launched by
the Government in 1989. The Mission found that the programme is not limited
to Yangon, but has broad national coverage. The scale and characteristics
of the land-development and other works was considered by the Mission to
be of such overwhelming significance to the present and future urban
situation that the Mission concentrated its resources on attempting to
assemble a comprehensive record of the programme and assessing the
impacts and implications.
The programme consists of: (a) land development for sites-and- services
resettlement schemes, and for complete housing units for public servants;
(b) new and improved roads; (c) urban rail transport; (d) road, rail and
pedestrian bridges; (e) parks and gardens; (f) redevelopment for commercial
and residential uses of sites cleared as a result of resettlement and fires; (g)
clean-up campaigns, building renovations, and repainting of facades; and
(h) rehabilitation of drains and water bodies.
For the size of the overall country population and for an urban population
of less than 10 million, the scale of works within the time period allocated is
probably unprecedented internationally. Based on visits to selected towns,
analysis of maps and layout plans, and the data supplied by GAD and HD,
the Mission estimates that the total population affected by the resettlement
and new housing components is in the order of 1.5 million, or 4 per cent of
the total population, and 16 percent of the urban population. Roughly 50 per

OBL:60092;Valley of Darkness - gold mining and militarization in Burma's Hugawng valley;;"Executive Summary: ""The remote and environmentally rich Hugawng valley in Burma's northern Kachin State has been internationally recognized as one of the world's hotspots of biodiversity. Indeed, the military junta ruling Burma, together with the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society, is establishing the world's largest tiger reserve in the valley. However, the conditions of the people living there have not received attention. This report by local researchers reveals the untold story of how the junta's militarization and self-serving expansion of the gold mining industry have devastated communities and ravaged the valley's forests and waterways.
The Hugawng valley was largely untouched by Burma's military regime until the mid-1990s. After a ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) and the junta in 1994, local residents had high hopes that peace would foster economic development and improved living conditions. However, under the junta's increased control, the rich resources of Hugawng valley have turned out to be a curse.
Despite the ceasefire, the junta has expanded its military infrastructure throughout Kachin State, increasing its presence from 26 battalions in 1994 to 41 in 2006. This expansion has been mirrored in Hugawng valley, where the number of military outposts has doubled; in the main town of Danai, public and private buildings have been seized and one third of the surrounding farmland confiscated. Some of the land and buildings were used to house military units, while others were sold to business interests for military profit.
In order to expand and ensure its control over gold mining revenues, the regime offered up 18% of the entire Kachin State for mining concessions in 2002. This transformed gold mining from independent gold panning to a large-scale mechanized industry controlled by the concession holders. In Hugawng valley concessions were sold to 8 selected companies and the number of main gold mining sites increased from 14 in 1994 to 31 sites in 2006. The number of active hydraulic and pit mines had exploded to approximately 100 by the end of 2006.
The regime's Ministry of Mines collects signing fees for the concessions as well as 35% - 50% tax on annual profits. Additional payments are rendered to the military's top commander for the region, various township and local authorities as well as the Minister of Mines personally. The junta has announced occasional bans on gold mining in Kachin State but as this report shows, these bans are temporary and selective, in effect used to maintain the junta's grip on mining revenues.
While the regime, called the State Peace and Development Council or SPDC, has consolidated political and financial control of the valley, it has not enforced its own existing (and very limited) environmental and health regulations on gold mining operations. This lack of regulation has resulted in deforestation, the destruction of river banks, and altering of river flows. Miners have been severely injured or killed by unsafe working practices and the lack of adequate health services. The environmental and health effects of mercury contamination have yet to be monitored and analyzed.
The most dramatic effects of this gold mining boom, however, have been on the social conditions of the local people. The influx of transient populations, together with harsh working conditions, a lack of education opportunities and poverty have led to the expansion of the drug, sex, and gambling industries in Hugawng valley. In one mining area it was estimated that 80% of inhabitants are addicted to opium and approximately 30% of miners use heroin and methamphetamines. Intravenous drug use and the sex industry have increased the spread of HIV/AIDS. Far from alleviating these social ills, local SPDC authorities collect fees from these illicit industries and even diminish efforts to curb them.
The SPDC continually boasts about how the people of Kachin State are benefiting from its border area development program. The case of Hugawng valley illustrates, however, the fundamental lack of local benefit from or participation in the development process. The SPDC is pursuing its interests of military expansion and revenue generation at the expense of social and environmental sustainability
This report documents local people speaking out about this destructive and unsustainable development.

OBL:62568;Pipeline Nightmare (English and Burmese ??????????);;"Shwe Pipeline Brings Land Confiscation, Militarization and Human Rights Violations to the Ta’ang People.
The Ta’ang Students and Youth Organization (TSYO) released a report today called “Pipeline Nightmare” that illustrates how the Shwe Gas and Oil Pipeline project, which will transport oil and gas across Burma to China, has resulted in the confiscation of people’s lands, forced labor, and increased military presence along the pipeline, affecting thousands of people.
Moreover, the report documents cases in 6 target cities and 51 villages of human rights violations committed by the Burmese Army, police and people’s militia, who take responsibility for security of the pipeline.
The government has deployed additional soldiers and extended 26 military camps in order to increase pressure on the ethnic armed groups and to provide security for the pipeline project and its Chinese workers. Along the pipeline, there is fighting on a daily basis between the Burmese Army and the Kachin Independence Army, Shan State Army – North and Ta’ang National Liberation Army in Namtu, Mantong and Namkham, where there are over one thousand Ta’ang (Palaung) refugees.
“Even though the international community believes that the government has implemented political reforms, it doesn’t mean those reforms have reached ethnic areas, especially not where there is increased militarization along the Shwe Pipeline, increased fighting between the Burmese Army and ethnic armed groups, and negative consequences for the people living in these areas,” said Mai Amm Ngeal, a member of TSYO.
The China National Petroleum Corporation and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise have signed agreements for the Shwe Pipeline, however the companies have not conducted any Environmental Impact Assessments or Social Impact Assessments. While the people living along the pipeline bear the brunt of the effects, the government will earn an estimated USD$29 billion over the next 30 years.
“The government and companies involved must be held accountable for the project and its effects on the local people, such as increasing military presence and Chinese workers along the pipeline, both of which cause insecurity for the local communities and especially women. The project has no benefit for the public, so it must be postponed,” said Lway Phoo Reang, Joint Secretary (1) of TSYO.
TSYO urges the government to postpone the Shwe Gas and Oil Pipeline project, to withdraw the military from Shan State, reach a ceasefire with all ethnic armed groups in the state, and address the root causes of the armed conflict by engaging in political dialogue.";;;Ta'ang Students and Youth Organization;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;07-11-2012;"en;my";"expropriation;land use;land grabbing;displacement;land investments;extractive industries;indigenous peoples;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land & Investments;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62568;http://burmalibrary.org/docs14/Pipeline_Nightmare-en-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:75174;Model villages are not a model (Burmese/ ??????????);;"Summary:

“As crony companies and foreign investment companies join with the
government in large-scale projects, a new model of “development” is
unfolding across Burma. To make way for hydropower dams and mono-crop
plantations, villagers have been forced into relocation camps, or so-called
“model villages.” The government and the companies state proudly in the
media that the living standard of these relocated people has improved, but the
reality is completely opposite.
The housing in the relocation camps is sub-standard. There is no clean water
for household use, insufficient drinking water, and inadequate education and
health care. Having lost their lands and livelihoods, the relocated people are
forced to find insecure and low-paid daily wage jobs to try and feed themselves.
They are constantly worrying about their future, and how to provide for their
children’s education. Women face increased risk of sexual harassment and assault by migrant laborers. In this situation, people do not feel like they are
living in “model villages.” They feel like they are living in refugee camps, full of
wretchedness and difficulty...

OBL:42888;RUNNING THE GAUNTLET: THE IMPACT OF INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT IN SOUTHERN SHAN STATE;;"The plight of Burma's internally displaced persons has largely been overlooked by the
international community and the Burmese government itself. Villagers in the country's war
zones nevertheless have suffered for decades the adverse effects of conflict. For some,
displacement has become a way of life and a multi-generational phenomenon.
Displacement wherever it occurs profoundly changes the persons forced to move. People
lose belongings, jobs, and loved ones. The case of the internally displaced in southern Shan
State is no different.
In this report, the Humanitarian Affairs Research Project documents the impact displacement
has had on civilians in southern Shan State and the living conditions in the various places to
which they fled. The report builds successfully on the work of other local research groups
and adds updated information and perspective to the study of Burma's internally displaced. It
will be a valuable addition to policy makers, academics, and anyone concerned about the fate
of the people of Shan State.
One lesson clearly emerging from the report is that the IDPs in southern Shan State clearly
are in need of protection and assistance. More needs to be done and it needs to be done now.
The Burmese government as well as other domestic and international actors should consider
carefully the ways in which this important goal can be accomplished. This report offers some
recommendations that can help to set the actors on the right path...""....This document contains a Shan version of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.

OBL:57392;Khoe Kay: Biodiversity in Peril;;"Executive Summary:
""A team of Karen researchers from the Karen Environmental and Social Action
Network has undertaken this study to begin documentation of the rich
 biodiversity of Khoe Kay, a bend in the Salween River that is part of their
homeland. They also want to document and expose the severe threats faced by this
stretch of the Salween, both from large dams and ongoing militarization.

Using methods of their own culture, as well as those used in university research, they have found that Khoe Kay is studded with both plant and animal diversity, with 194 plant species and 200 animals identified.
Forty-two of these species are considered endangered, being found in IUCN's Redlist, the CITES Appendices, or both. Thus, conservation of the area will protect many globally important resources.
Endemic and unknown species are also represented, with eight endemic fish species of particular interest. Also, many of the plants and animals unknown to Western science are used by the Karen for food and medicine, providing opportunities for further research. Furthermore, several entire taxa, such as mollusks, spiders and fungi, have been treated very lightly if at all in this report, so the reader is encouraged to undertake further study with assistance from KESAN.
Lying on the riverine border of Thailand and Burma, the area is relatively untrammeled. Teak trees dominate, and therefore Khoe Kay provides a window into the biodiversity of the entire region prior to industrial development.

Forest is Life - A Story of Climate Change, Forest and Communities
Climate change has become an environmental problem affecting people throughout the world. Climate change is mainly the result of increasing global temperature, which results in shifting weather patterns such as unseasonal rains that affect agriculture, droughts, floods, plagues and diseases. Global warming is mainly the result of the increase of greenhouse gases, above all CO2, in the earth’s atmosphere. Scientists say that 17% to 20% of the global CO2 emissions are a result of the destruction and degradation of forests. REDD (Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries) is one of the mitigation measures currently promoted for helping decrease emissions of carbon into the atmosphere.

This comics book discusses climate change and REDD from the perspective of indigenous communities. It is intended primarily for communities as a simple guide to help them understand climate change and REDD. It discusses the importance and the roles of forest in climate change, the concept of REDD and how it relates to and affects indigenous communities. It points at potential negative impacts of REDD for the recognition and exercise of the collective rights of indigenous peoples, especially on the right to land, territories and resources. Finally, it shows why and how the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) can be used to uphold and protect the rights of indigenous communities in REDD.";;;IWGIA and AIPP;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-05-2012;en;"forest land;capacity building;local community";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/63385;http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0586_REDD_Cartoon_book_engl.pdf;;;;

OBL:63380;Mongabay.com - Myanmar (Burma);;"Rich, colourful rather chaotic site...""...Until the late 1990s, large parts of southern and eastern Burma had remained free from military rule due to the resistance of indigenous groups. However the inflow of foreign capital, mainly through offshore natural gas concessions to foregin firms, has given the military the means to assert control over these regions and increasingly exploit teak and other forest resources, in addition to local populations.

What this all means is that today Burma has one of the highest rates of forest loss on Earth. Between 1990 and 2005, Burma lost an average of 466,000 hectares of forest per year—or 18 percent of its total forest cover during that period. The deforestation rate has increased by 13.5 percent since the close of the 1990s...""...Myanmar Forest Figures...individual articles, most of which have only a passing reference to Burma...

Deforestation and forest degradation in Burma largely results from agriculture, logging, fuel wood collection, and, to a lesser extent, development for energy infrastructure. Logging in Burma is predominantly for teak, although the government is trying to promote the country's lesser known timber species to the international market. While there has been an official ban on raw log exports since 1993, evidence collected by several groups, including Global Witness, suggests that illegal logging is ride in Burma...""...Use the search or make a google site-specific search - myanmar site:Mongabay.com";;;Mongabay.com;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;;en;forest land;Forest Tenure;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/63380;http://rainforests.mongabay.com/20myanmar.htm;;;;
OBL:63144;The Process and Prospects for Resettlement of Displaced Persons on the Thai-Myanmar Border;;"Sustainable Solutions to the Displaced Person Situation
On the Thai-Myanmar Border.....Conclusion:
Resettlement operations within the shelters in Thailand have now been ongoing continuously for more than 5 years with over 64,000 departures completed as of the end of 2010. However, despite the large investment of financial and human resources in this effort, the displacement situation appears not to have diminished significantly in scale as of yet. While no stakeholders involved with the situation in Thailand are currently calling for an end to resettlement activities, there has been little agreement about what role resettlement actually
x
serves in long-term solutions for the situation. For the most part, the program has been implemented thus far in a reflexive manner rather than as a truly responsive and solutions-oriented strategy, based primarily upon the parameters established by the policies of resettlement nations and the RTG rather than the needs of the displaced persons within the shelters.
Looking towards the future, it appears highly unlikely that resettlement can resolve the displaced person situation in the border shelters as a lone durable solution and almost certainly not if the status quo registration policies and procedures of the RTG are maintained. All stakeholders involved with trying to address the situation are currently stuck with the impractical approach of attempting to resolve a protracted state of conflict and human rights abuses within Myanmar without effective means for engaging with the situation in-country. Neither stemming the tide of new displacement flows nor establishing conditions that would allow for an eventual safe return appear feasible at this time.
Within the limitations of this strategy framework, a greater level of cooperation between resettlement countries, international organizations, and the RTG to support a higher quantity of departures for resettlement through addressing the policy constraints and personal capacity restrictions to participation appears a desirable option and might allow for resettlement to begin to have a more significant impact on reducing the scale of displacement within Thailand. However, realistically this would still be unlikely to resolve the situation as a whole if not conducted in combination with more actualized forms of local integration within Thailand and within the context of reduced displacement flows into the shelters.
The overall conclusion reached about resettlement is that it continues to play a meaningful palliative, protective, and durable solution role within the shelters in Thailand. While it is necessary for resettlement to remain a carefully targeted program, the stakeholders involved should consider expanding resettlement to allow participation of legitimate asylum seekers within the shelters who are currently restricted from applying because of the lack of a timely status determination process. Allowing higher levels of participation in resettlement through addressing this policy constraint, as well as some of the more personal constraints that prevent some families within the shelters from moving on with their lives, would be a positive development in terms of providing durable solutions to the situation. In conjunction with greater opportunities for local integration and livelihood options for those who cannot or do not wish to participate in resettlement, the program should be expanded to make the option of an alternative to indefinite encampment within the shelters in Thailand available to a larger group of eligible displaced persons...";"Ben Harkins

OBL:75009;Precarity and Social Mobilization among Migrant Workers from Myanmar in Thailand;;"ABSTRACT: ""Fleeing state-sponsored violence and economic decline in their home country, hundreds
of thousands of Myanmar émigrés have in recent years crossed the border into
Thailand
in search of a better life.
For the estimated 2 million Myanmar migrants now living there,
however, life in Thailand presents its own challenges. With insufficient legal provisions
to handle the influx of migrants, the Thai government has largely turned a blind eye to
abuse and exploitation suffered by migrant workers. Yet despite poor working conditions
and exploitation, there does not appear to be much of a call to improve conditions
through mobilization among the Myanmar migrant community.
The marked absence of mobilization on any level thus begs the question: why is the
migrant population in Thailand so passive in the face of severe strain and exploitation?
This thesis explores the issue of non-
mobilization among
migrant groups, using as a
framework two core concepts: social mobilization and precarity. The long-standing
discourse on social mobilization focuses on social and political action in response to
societal strain, taking into account other factors such as
access to resources and
institutional opportunities. Precarity, a newer concept and compliment to the established
social mobilization debates,
has been used to describe a
lifestyle characterized by

OBL:45921;Rich Periphery, Poor Center: Myanmar's Rural Economy;;"Abstract:
""This paper looks at the case of Myanmar in order to investigate the behavior and welfare of
rural households in an economy under transition from a planned to a market system. Myanmar's
case is particularly interesting because of the country's unique attempt to preserve a policy of
intervention in land transactions and marketing institutions. A sample household survey that we
conducted in 2001, covering more than 500 households in eight villages with diverse
agro-ecological environments, revealed two paradoxes. First, income levels are higher in
villages far from the center than in villages located in regions under the tight control of the
central authorities. Second, farmers and villages that emphasize a paddy-based, irrigated
cropping system have lower farming incomes than those that do not. The reason for these
paradoxes are the distortions created by agricultural policies that restrict land use and the
marketing of agricultural produce. Because of these distortions, the transition to a market
economy in Myanmar since the late 1980s is only a partial one. The partial transition, which
initially led to an increase in output and income from agriculture, revealed its limit in the survey
period.""...There are 2 versions of this paper. The one placed as the main URL, which also has a later publication date, seems to be longer, though it is about 30K smaller.";"Ikuko Okamoto

OBL:62388;APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION - China’s trade in illegal timber (text, video and Burmese press release);;"This report covers several countries in Asia and Africa.....""Myanmar contains some of the most significant
natural forests left in the Asia Pacific region,
host to an array of biodiversity and vital to the
livelihoods of local communities. Forests are
estimated to cover 48 per cent of the country’s
land. Yet other recent estimates put forest
cover at just 24 per cent.
These vital forests are disappearing rapidly. Myanmar has one
of the worst rates of deforestation on the planet, with 18 per
cent of its forests lost between 1990 and 2005. Myanmar’s
forest sector is rife with corruption and illegality, leading to
over-harvesting and smuggling. Natural teak from Myanmar is
especially sought after on the international market for its
unique characteristics and availability.
Since the late 1990s, neighbouring China has imported large
volumes of timber from Myanmar, the bulk of which have been
logged and traded illegally. In 1997, China imported 300,000
cubic metres of timber from Myanmar; by 2005 this had risen
to 1.6 million cubic metres....In April 2012, EIA investigators travelled to the southern
Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Yunnan to examine current
dynamics of the illicit cross-border trade in logs from Myanmar,
especially Kachin State. The investigation involved monitoring
crossing points on the Yunnan-Kachin border, surveying
wholesale timber markets to assess the origin of wood supplies,
and undercover meetings with Chinese firms trading and
processing timber from Myanmar.
The investigation revealed continuing transport of logs across
the border, despite the 2006 agreements between the two
countries to halt such trade. Chinese traders confirmed that as
long as taxes are paid at the point of import, logs are allowed in
despite a commitment from the Yunnan provincial government
to allow in only timber accompanied by documents from the
Myanmar authorities attesting to its legal origin. As the
authorities dictate that all wood exports must be handled
by the Myanmar Timber Enterprise and shipped via Rangoon,
logs moving across the land border to Yunnan cannot possibly
be legal.
Field visits uncovered movement of temperate hardwood timber
species from the mountains of Kachin State into central Yunnan via several crossing points, with trade in teak and rosewood
centred around the border town of Ruili further south. The
contrast in the condition of the forests along the border was
striking; while forests in the mountainous region on the
Chinese side of the border are relatively intact, with large areas
protected in the Gaoligong Nature Reserve, across the border in
Kachin the devastation wreaked by logging is clearly visible.
Chinese wood traders confirmed that supplies were coming
from further inside Kachin, as timber within a hundred kilometres
of the border has been logged out, and told how deals are done
with insurgent groups to buy up entire mountains for logging.
One local community elder in Kachin interviewed by EIA
summed up the situation: “Myanmar is China’s supermarket
and Kachin State is their 7-11.”...";;;Environmental Investigation Agency;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;29-11-2012;en;deforestation;"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62388;http://burmalibrary.org/docs14/EIA-Appetite_for_Destruction.pdf;;;;

Professor Vitit concludes with a series of 12 recommendations for both government and non-government sectors. This publication also contains copies of all six sub-regional, bilateral, MOUs on counter trafficking and employment cooperation...
""...Migrant workers can contribute greatly to their home and destination countries, if the process is well managed and
if they are protected from abuse and exploitation. In reality, the situation is rendered complex by that fact that many
do not enter the destination countries legally. In the market of demand and supply, regrettably many are victims of
human smuggling and trafficking. Moreover, influxes of migrant workers who come without the necessary documents,
such as visas and work permits, often result in draconian measures such as deportation from the territory of the
destination countries, without adequate guarantees for their safety and dignity.
The lesson from Thailand is that to date, a closed door policy on migration from neighbouring countries has not
worked, given the porous border and Thailand's own labour market which acts as a pull factor. Wisely the country is
now moving towards a new and more open door policy: managing migration through cooperation between the
countries of origin and Thailand as a destination country, and synchronizing with Thailand's own labour market. In
2005 the country introduced a regularization process based upon registration of migrant workers and their employers,
with guarantees for basic rights, and this needs to be supported well in terms of effective implementation and
humane treatment of all workers....CONTENTS: Foreword...

OBL:72020;Community Forestry in Cease-Fire Zones in Kachin State, Northern Burma: Formalizing Collective Property in Contested Ethnic Areas;;"... Community forests (CF) in northern Burma, particularly in Kachin State, have been sprouting up in villages since the mid-2000s, spearheaded by national NGOs. The recent watershed of CF establishment follows several contingent foundational factors: greater political stability and government control in cease-fire zones; enhanced NGO capacity, access, and effectiveness in these areas; and most prominently the recent threat of agribusiness. This paper will critically examine (inter-)national NGO?s assistance to rural farmers in formalizing collective forestland in cease-fire zones as a resistance strategy to land dispossession from military/state-backed agribusiness concessions.

My overall argument is that while CF represents a legally-sanctioned, bottom-up resistance against land dispossession – a rare phenomenon in a country such as Burma – an unintended consequence is producing forms of contested state authority and power in cease-fire zones. For instances of post-war zones with continued contentious ethnic politics and contested state authority, as is the case in northern Burma, rebuilding state-society resource relations and institutions present new political and resource use and access challenges. Data presented here is part of a broader research agenda conducted since the early-2000s on resource politics in northern Burma, with qualitative analysis for this paper based upon interviews with CF user groups, participant observation at CF workshops, interviews with Burmese NGOs, and secondary materials. This research project is a work-in-progress, and all errors are of course of my own unintentional making.

CF represents a refashioned collective property regime. This novel land management strategy does not represent any sort of customary arrangement; in fact Kachin are upland swidden farmers, not strictly forest-dwelling communities. This scenario then causes conflict in that the CF joint- management plans mirror state land classification schemes that firmly delineate between „forest. and „agriculture. land uses, unlike traditional land management (much like for other rural communities) that does not clearly separate forest from agriculture. CF falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Forestry (MoF), which enables the increasingly weak MoF to stake an institutional claim against the increasingly powerful Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI). In addition to symbolizing emerging state institutional struggles in cease-fire zones, newly established CF are also altering local resource use and access by villagers planting state-favored, high-value timber trees, such as infamous Burmese teak, in former swiddens – an act that uncomfortably brings colonial-dictated resource use practices into the present. Furthermore, only CF user groups can access forest products, with outsiders (non-CF members, even within the village) formally blocked from access, including for shifting cultivation.

By farmers and NGOs attempting to block the expansion of large-scale agricultural plantations, they instead cultivate state authority and institutions, in this case the Forestry Department, state-recognized land management categories, and new state-governed farmers. This case study highlights the importance of seriously considering how development interventions cultivate new forms of authority and power –perceived as both legitimate and illegitimate by different actors – in post-war zones when devising collective action strategies. These same interventions also inculcate new environmental practices in farmers, shaping them into NGO-state subjects that contrast with their customary practices. In this case, NGOs assisting farmers in establishing state-authorized collective property in the form of CF does not respect customary land use, facilitates bringing in a villager-perceived illegitimate state, and is increasing food insecurity. The positives though – which may or may not outweigh the negatives – include stemming the tide of land dispossession by private companies and providing a potential platform for political mobilizing at the village level. An alternative strategy could be to push for legal recognition of customary land management, such as upland swidden cultivation, could potentially block rubber expansion while concomitantly strengthening food security, customary land use regimes, and traditional village power bases to challenge state centralization in these politically contested cease-fire ethnic areas...";Kevin Woods;;CAPRi;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;01-07-2010;en;"farmland;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing;community forestry;security of tenure (land)";"Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72020;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/CAPRi_Conflict_Woods_CF_and_formalization.pdf;;;;
OBL:72026;Facilitating Decentralized Policy for Sustainable Forest Governance in Myanmar: Lessons from the Philippines;;... In Myanmar, people's participation has been prioritized as an imperative of national forest policy in 1995 endorsed by the community forestry instructions (DFIs). Today, there are about 42,148 ha of community forestry (CF) management by 572 user groups (USGs). In CF management, the people are engaging three types of activities: (1) to preserve of improve the production system such as planting trees and promoting the growth of trees, (2) to use forest resources for subsistence needs, (3) to get cash by selling the timber harvested or furniture made by the timber. Initial participation by the people and their continuation of CF activities are considered to be indispensable for sustainable forest management. In practice, however, the improvement of forest management and protection are often threatened because of difficulties in continuing the activities even though initial participation was achieved. Providing secure property rights is among the major factors that contribute to continuing CF activities. Thus the objectives of the dissertation are (1) to find out the factors affecting initial participation of USG members in management actitities in Myanmar, (2) to assess the role of property rights in sustaining CF activities in the Philippines, and (3) to draw implications for Myanmar policy in terms of property rights issues from the case of the Philippines...;Ei Ei Swe Hlaing;;University of Tokyo;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2009;en;community forestry;"Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72026;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/EiEi_SustainableForestManagementi.pdf;;;;

OBL:72028;Market Research and Enterprise Development for Community Forestry in Myanmar;;"... Pyoe Pin is a programme aimed at strengthening civil society in Myanmar. The programme is supported by DFID, the British Department for International Cooperation and implemented through the British council in partnership with local NGOs. Community Forestry (CF) is a key element of the programme, as it is seen as pathway to increasing the participation of civil society in influencing policy and practice with regards to communities. access and sustainable use of forestry land. CF can also improve forestry conservation and enhance the livelihoods of
communities.

CF has been a national development tool since 1995, when the Ministry of Forestry issued instructions for the issuing of Community Forest certificates. In Kachin state in northern Myanmar bordering China, Pyoe Pin has been working with two local NGOs (ECODEV and Shalom Foundation), who are in turn engaging with forest villages, to increase their awareness of appropriate forest usage and management, through assisting these communities to apply for community forest certificates.

These certificates provide community rights to forest products and tenure for 30 years. Working through 120 villages, 54 Forest User Groups (FUGs) consisting of about 40,000 people have been created, who are replanting degraded forest areas, and also balancing their livelihood
needs with greater understanding of sustainability. So far, 31,445 acres have been prepared for CF, but aside from 3000 of these acres, the rest has not yet been granted the lease, largely a result of lack of institutional support for this process as government prioritizes commercial
allocations of land over community allocations for CF.

As yet, CF has not shown significant direct economic impacts, but it is hoped that income from forest products, produced by and for the communities engaged, will have an impact on the incomes of the communities and households involved. One of the challenges has been how to increase the commercial viability and impact of CF by bringing greater alignment between commercial and community priorities.

Some parts of the CF Instruction have hindered the maximization of economic benefits that can be gained by CF as they limit community rights to harvesting and selling at minimal levels. In addition, both private sector and Government have not considered CF as a potential partner for
sourcing raw materials. But the environment is ripe for undertaking analysis and piloting of alternative models. There is a new Minister of Forestry, formerly head of Myanmar Timber Enterprise, who has experience in extensive forest-based commercial ventures. In addition, a recent national CF workshop was the first of the kind to bring experts from around the region to discuss findings from a national-level appraisal of CF in Myanmar since inception 15 years ago.

In this context, Pyoe Pin envisages to develop a pilot project that will seek to demonstrate:
1. the value of CF as a real national development tool for the poorest communities, and to increase institutional support for its realization.
2. CF can be a commercially viable business partner for private sector
3. that it is important that communities who apply for CF status should be supported with the expedient granting of leases
4. that CF Instructions need to be revised to allow communities to commercialize their CF

Towards these objectives, Pyoe Pin started to identify CF products that could have the greatest market potential and feasibility of being taken up by community forestry, which can then supply the products to larger domestic and possibly even international markets. An initial brainstorming session with foresters from NGOs and research institutes and businessmen from the Timber Market Association in December 2010 identified a preliminary shortlist of forest products. This selection was mainly based on secondary sources of information on market
potential to help narrow down a more appropriate list for additional value-chain analysis...";"Foppes

OBL:72029;Rapid Assessment of Options for Independent Sustainability Certification for Community Forestry in Myanmar;;"... We here examine several options for independent certification of community forests with a view to legal timber harvest.

A number of certification standards and types have been developed world-wide, with the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC; www.pefc.org)
and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC; info.fsc.org) being the most widely recognised standards for Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and Chain of Custody (CoC) certification.

This report considers the suitability of both systems in the context of nationally recognised community forest management in Myanmar, through the conduct of a rapid field assessment of the constraints and opportunities in two forest user group networks in Tanintharyi region and Kachin State.

Certification concepts and our initial findings were presented in a roundtable meeting in Yangon in August hosted jointly with EcoDev and the Myanmar Timber Merchants
Association, and attended by RECOFTC, Myanmar Forest Certification Committee, IUCN and other stakeholders. The presentations are reproduced in Annex 1 and 2.

Our rapid field evaluation shows that, in the case study sites, an external review by an accredited timber certifier – either Forest Stewardship Council or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification – would currently cost more than the benefits it will bring to the to smallholders. The main constraints are that; a) managed
areas are currently too small (";"Bjoern Wode

OBL:73511;New highway is more than just a road for Myanmar;;"For as long as anyone can remember, the road from Kawkareik in Kayin State to the Thai border has only been passable in one direction at a time. One day, traffic goes ""up"" from southern Myanmar's hinterland; the next it goes ""down"" from Myawaddy -- the busiest trade post on the Thai-Myanmar frontier. Myawaddy is just opposite the Thai town of Mae Sot.

 The poor condition of the road that crosses the Dawna mountain range means the journey of just 32km -- as the crow flies -- can take more than four hours by car. But a new road now nearing completion will cut that time to less than an hour, potentially turning Myawaddy's scrappy border crossing into a major trade hub.

 Myanmar state-run media says the new Thai-funded road is not scheduled to open officially until July. But foreign businessmen and locals who can afford the steep tolls are being allowed onto its as-yet unsealed surface.

During the first phase of the project (1960-1970) considerable progress was achieved, however, progress slowed down when financial assistance was suspended in 1975.

Entering into the 1980s and 1990s, regional political and economic changes spurred new momentum for the Asian Highway Project. It became one of the three pillars of Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) project, endorsed by ESCAP Commission at its forty-eight session in 1992, comprising Asian Highway, Trans-Asian Railway and facilitation of land transport projects.

Although a number of NGOs and government mobile clinics are providing basic health services inside the roughly 80 camps and settlements, they are limited, and emergency health referrals remain a serious concern, they say.

According to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), conditions inside the camps, combined with the segregation of ethnic Buddhist Rakhine and Muslim Rohingya and ongoing movement restrictions, are having a severe impact on health care.

Movement restrictions were slapped on Rohingyas around Sittwe, the Rakhine State capital, after bouts of sectarian violence in June and October 2012.

Another concern is the negative attitude of many ethnic Rakhine to assistance provided to Muslim IDPs.

On 31 May, the Burmese government and the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), which has been fighting for greater autonomy for decades, agreed to further dialogue and talks on the resettlement of tens of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs).

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there are more than 85,000 IDPs in Kachin and Shan states (both in the north), including over 50,000 (58.5 percent) in areas controlled by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the military wing of the KIO. Many others are staying with host families.

Over the past two years, hundreds have been killed in the conflict and there has been extensive damage to livelihoods and infrastructure.

According to the recently released inter-agency Kachin Response Plan, an upsurge in fighting in late 2012 triggered the displacement of several thousand more people.

OBL:65920;Under Siege in Kachin State, Burma;;"Executive Summary:
""In September 2011, as the international community discussed easing sanctions on Burma’s
military-backed civilian government, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) conducted an emergency
investigation in Burma’s Kachin State in response to reports of grave human rights violations
in the region. The aims of the study were
1. to independently investigate reported human rights abuses and war crimes; and
2. to assess the humanitarian situation and nutritional status of internally displaced
persons (IDPs) displaced by conflict in 2011.
This report provides the first humanitarian assessment of some of the IDPs living in areas of
Kachin State that are not controlled by the Burmese government. The United Nations Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) recently released a report on the health
situation of 5900 IDPs in urban and peri-urban areas of Kachin state that are under Burmese
government control. But no mention was made of the estimated 22,000 displaced people in
other areas of the state. PHR conducted its investigation entirely in these areas; this report will
help to build a more complete picture of the humanitarian situation among internally displaced
persons in politically contested areas in Kachin State.
The human rights investigation provides compelling evidence that the Burmese army (the
Tatmadaw) has committed multiple human rights violations in Kachin State. Between June and
September 2011, the Burmese army looted food from civilians, fired indiscriminately into villages,
threatened villages with attacks, and used civilians as porters, human minesweepers,
and impressed guides. Our findings are consistent with similar reports of human rights abuses
in other ethnic states, and suggest that violations of rights of ethnic nationalities in the country
by the central government are systematic and widespread.
In addition to the human rights investigation, PHR visited six camps and four shelters for displaced
Kachin civilians on the Sino-Burmese border and conducted health and nutrition assessments
from 22-30 September, 2011. The camps fail to meet multiple minimum humanitarian
standards outlined in the Sphere humanitarian guidelines. Camps are overcrowded and there
are insufficient numbers of latrines and water supply points. Camp medical staff reported that
upper respiratory infections and diarrhea were the most common reasons for clinic visits, and
that they experienced shortages in medicine for infants.
Key human rights findings of this report:
• The Burmese army forced Kachin civilians to guide combat units and walk in front of army
columns to trigger landmines. This practice puts civilians at extreme risk of injury and
death and is a war crime.
• The Burmese army regularly pillaged food and supplies from civilians. This practice is
prohibited under customary international humanitarian law.
• The Burmese army fired automatic weapons directly into a civilian village, striking nonmilitary
targets. The intentional direction of attacks against civilians is also recognized as
a war crime in the Rome Statute1, the treaty that created the International Criminal Court.

Under Siege in Kachin State, Burma
Key related humanitarian concerns:
• IDP camps are overcrowded and the numbers of latrines and water supply points are
insufficient to ensure that residents’ human rights to clean food and water are met. Camp
medical staff reported insufficient supplies of medicine for infants.
• Eleven percent of children under five years old in one camp in Laiza were found to be
severely or moderately malnourished, a situation that the World Health Organization
(WHO) classifies as “severe” and warrants targeted supplementary feeding programs.
• Very little aid reaches IDP camps, and groups caring for them face challenges in providing
food, medicine, and shelter. The most vulnerable populations—those in rural areas and
near the border—have not received any official humanitarian aid; they are only receiving
aid from community-based organizations, which have largely been ignored by the
international donor community.
This investigation suggests that the incremental political changes in central Burma have not
translated into improved livelihoods or improved the human rights situation of ethnic populations
living along Burma’s frontiers. The government of Burma has announced greater freedoms,
including unblocking some internet websites and limiting censorship in the press, and
releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and a fraction of the other political prisoners in the country. Some
in the international community have asserted that political change has come to Burma; however,
these changes largely are confined to the urban, primarily ethnic Burman, population. For
many of the peoples of Burma facing conflict and abuse, including the Kachin peoples, the brutality
of the old regime remains an omnipresent threat.
PHR’s findings come at a crucial moment when the international community is considering
easing sanctions on Burma in response to its positive steps towards what Senior General Than
Shwe has called “disciplined democracy.” PHR welcomes the stated commitment of the government
to greater openness and urges the international community to ensure that the rhetoric
translates into positive action for all people in Burma. The Kachin and other groups continue to
endure grave human rights violations at the hands of the Burmese army. True progress must be
measured by thorough analysis of the extent of the government’s abuses and by establishing a
system through which perpetrators are held accountable for their actions...";"Bill Davis

OBL:98889;LAND TENURE IN RURAL LOWLAND MYANMAR - From historical perspectives to contemporary realities in the Dry zone and the Delta - English, Burmese (??????????);;"This study emerged out of an identified need to document social 
processes leading to land insecurity, and those leading to investment 
and sustainable use of lands by rural populations. Focusing on the 
Delta and Dry Zone, the main paddy producing regions of Myanmar, 
this analysis unravels the powers at play in shaping rural households’ 
relationship to land. From British colonization to the 2012 reforms, 
many issues have remained relatively unchanged with regards to 
local dynamics of landlessness, exclusion processes, local power plays, 
restrictions in farmers’ land rights and the State’s excessive focus on 
rice. In the midst of a fast evolving legal context, this work provides a 
typology of farmers and the landless and argues that more attention 
needs to be paid to understand the diversity of rural households and

OBL:42410;Deserted Fields: The destruction of agriculture in Mong Nai Township, Shan State;;"Summary:
""Wrong-headed agricultural and development policies, counter-insurgency activities, as well
as corruption and cronyism by the Burmese military regime, have all caused a dramatic
decrease in rice production and food security in southern Shan State over the past ten years.
The township of Mong Nai provides a good example of how food security, commonly defined
as the physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food at all times, has
been put in a precarious condition despite the regime’s claims that it is achieving self-sufficiency
and agricultural development. In the past Mong Nai was well known for its fertile land and
abundant production of quality rice. Even though people could not make much income from
their crops, they had enough to survive. Since 1994, however, a series of national policies and
initiatives have led to a decline in rice production, the abandonment of fertile fields, and the
exodus of thousands of residents to neighbouring Thailand.
In order to implement its national rice procurement policy, the State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC) set up a paddy (unmilled rice) buying center in the town of Mong Nai in
1994. Farmers were forced to sell rice to the regime at depressed prices (about one quarter
of the normal market price) based on the acreage of land they customarily tended and regardless
of actual crop yields. This center, and how its quota system was implemented, disrupted
farmers’ access to their own rice harvests and drove many into debt. The SPDC proudly
announced the abolishment of this system and the opening of a market-oriented economy in
2003. However, new practices have been able to ensure that the military maintains its own
stores of rice at the expense of local populations. agriculture, and led to decreased rice production and food security in the township. The
amount of rice fields under cultivation has decreased by approximately 56% since 1994
while the population has decreased by approximately 30%. The drastic decrease in upland
agriculture has practically wiped out the cultivation of sesame and the subsequent production
of sesame oil in the township, while a wide variety of beans, fruits, and other vegetables are
also not cultivated. Restrictions on trade and travel have made foodstuffs harder to get and
more expensive.
Contrary to the regime’s claims, Burma is not on the road to self-sufficiency and food security.""...

OBL:75586;CASE STUDY ON LAND IN BURMA;;"Report Summary: ""This case study has been produced in response to a request made to the Evidence on Demand Helpdesk. The objective of the request was to write a detailed case study on land tenure reform in a fragile and post-conflict state, Burma, and provide the reader with an understanding of how land tenure reform can work under the country’s particular social, political and economic conditions.
Burma is a fragile state undergoing a period of profound economic and political reform following a period of conflict and isolation. As the poorest country in South Asia, land is the main asset for many people, especially in rural areas where most of Burma’s population lives. However, most farmers have weak tenure security, and in the recent past have been exposed to land expropriation by the Burmese army and the other state institutions of a military dictatorship. Additionally, in conflict-affected border states, the strategy of government forces and non-state armed groups to finance military operations by leasing land to investors has led to land grabbing on both sides.
The recent political changes that have put the country back on the road to civilian rule have profound implications for security of land tenure. Land legislation passed in 2012 is meant to strengthen the formal land administration and provide more rights for landholders, including the right to lease and sell land. It also introduces a system for issuing land use certificates, which the government plans to roll out swiftly over the next few years. At the same time, the government’s policy to open up to foreign investment for large-scale agriculture, mining and industrial zones threatens to place further pressure on access to land. How recent legal reforms translate into land tenure reform, i.e. into changes in the terms and conditions of how land is held and transacted, remains to be seen and depends on whether state institutions desist from, and prevent, further expropriation, and whether the new Farmland Management Boards that administer land at the local level function effectively. Commentators warn that weaknesses in the legal framework potentially disadvantage farmer’s tenure security in the face of powerful state-backed interests; however, evidence suggesting if these fears are confirmed is unavailable. This case study discusses the content of these legal reforms in the context of Burmese politics, noting how some of the changes intended in the laws may have an impact on the tenure security of landholders.
Donors can support improved land administration by increasing dialogue on land issues with political leaders, by funding technical expertise to assist land administration functions and land governance processes, and by highlighting learning experiences from other countries with similar characteristics. They can help rural landholders to improve their security of tenure by funding civil society groups to carry out research and awareness-raising campaigns among landholders, by providing direct training to farmers to better negotiate land sales or leases, and by funding activities that raise the awareness of private sector entities on how to avoid poor practices associated with leasing land.";Giles Henley;;ODI, DFID, CEIL PEAKS via Evidence on Demand;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;14-03-2014;en;"land policies;land administration;land governance;land law";;Land Policy & Legislation;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75586;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/Henley-2014-03-Burma_case_study_land-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:64526;Untold Miseries - Wartime Abuses and Forced Displacement in Burma’s Kachin State;;"#039;When Burmese President Thein Sein took office in March 2011, he said that over 60 years of armed conflict have put Burma’s
ethnic populations through “the hell of untold miseries.” Just three months later, the Burmese armed forces resumed military
operations against the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), leading to serious abuses and a humanitarian crisis affecting tens of
thousands of ethnic Kachin civilians.
“Untold Miseries”: Wartime Abuses and Forced Displacement in Kachin State is based on over 100 interviews in Burma’s Kachin
State and China’s Yunnan province. It details how the Burmese army has killed and tortured civilians, raped women, planted
antipersonnel landmines, and used forced labor on the front lines, including children as young as 14-years-old. Soldiers have
attacked villages, razed homes, and pillaged properties. Burmese authorities have failed to authorize a serious relief effort in
KIA-controlled areas, where most of the 75,000 displaced men, women, and children have sought refuge. The KIA has also been
responsible for serious abuses, including using child soldiers and antipersonnel landmines.
Human Rights Watch calls on the Burmese government to support an independent international mechanism to investigate
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by all parties to Burma’s ethnic armed conflicts. The government
should also provide United Nations and humanitarian agencies unhindered access to all internally displaced populations, and
make a long-term commitment with humanitarian agencies to authorize relief to populations in need.&#039";;;Human Rights Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;19-03-2012;en;"land conflicts;local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/64526;http://burmalibrary.org/docs13/Untold_Miseries-Kachin-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:62603;Changing Realities, Poverty and Displacement in South East Burma/Myanmar - 2012 Survey (TBC);;"A significant decrease in forced displacement has been documented by community?based
organisations in South East Myanmar after a series of ceasefire agreements were negotiated earlier this
year. While armed conflict continues in Kachin State and communal violence rages in Rakhine State, field
surveys indicate that that there has been a substantial decrease in hostilities affecting Karen, Karenni,
Shan and Mon communities.
In its annual survey of displacement and poverty released today, the Thailand Burma Border Consortium
(TBBC) estimates that 10,000 people were forced from their homes during the past year in comparison to
an average of 75,000 people displaced every year during the previous decade. While there remain at least
400,000 internally displaced persons in rural areas of South East Myanmar, the tentative return of 37,000
civilians to their villages or surrounding areas reflects hope for an end to displacement.
After supporting refugees and internally displaced persons for nearly three decades, TBBC’s Executive
Director Jack Dunford is optimistic about the possibility of forging a sustainable solution but conscious
that there are many obstacles still to come. “The challenge of transforming preliminary ceasefire
agreements into a substantive peace process is immense, but this is the best chance we have ever had to
create the conditions necessary to support voluntary and dignified return in safety”, said Mr Dunford.
Poverty assessments conducted by TBBC’s community?based partners with over 4,000 households across
21 townships provide a sobering reminder about the impact of protracted conflict on civilian livelihoods.
The findings suggest that 59% of households in rural communities of South East Myanmar are
impoverished, with the indicators particularly severe in northern Karen areas where there have been
allegations of widespread and systematic human rights abuse.
The Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Myanmar reported to the United Nations General Assembly
last month that truth, justice and accountability are integral to the process of securing peace and national
reconciliation. Mr Dunford commented that “after all the violence and abuse, inclusive planning processes
can help to rebuild trust by ensuring that the voices of those most affected are heard and that civil society
representatives are involved at all stages”."" (TBC Press Release, 31 October 2012).....

These tensions have intensified as the country has embarked on a process of democratic transition and reform, with greater openness in some areas, but continued military dominance in other sectors, particularly where the military controls key government ministries.

Officials regularly charge villagers with criminal trespass if they refuse to leave land, and in one case, police torched a village. Militia commanders have also used threats, force, and arbitrary arrests to intimidate farmers and take land, particularly in areas still contested by ethnic Karen armed groups.

Land disputes are a major national problem, with rising discontent over displacement for plantation agriculture, resource extraction, and infrastructure projects—often without adequate consultation, due process of law, or compensation for those displaced. In many parts of the country, those contesting land seizures have taken to the streets in frequent demonstrations but have faced retaliation in the courts.

The dual problems of land confiscation and reprisals against protesters is particularly acute in Karen State. Located along the border with much more prosperous Thailand, Karen State is viewed by many as a desirable site for investment in the tourism, extractive, and agriculture industries.

The economic opening of the country to investors has made land more valuable, while the peace process in Karen State and other ethnic areas has given access to areas previously beyond the reach of the Burmese armed forces and military-linked businessmen. The result is that powerful interests are gaining land through questionable means while farmers are losing it, often without adequate compensation.

As peace negotiations continue and the return of refugees from Thailand gains credence, land tenure issues will likely intensify, particularly as those who return find that land they previously farmed has now been occupied by government or business interests.[1]

This report focuses on government abuses related to land confiscation in areas near Hpa-an, the capital of Karen State. The villages in this area are under the effective control of the Burmese military, called the Tatmadaw, and military-controlled militias called Border Guard Forces (BGFs), or are located in areas of mixed governance by the ethnic armed group Karen National Union (KNU) or other militias and the government.

The report illustrates the dynamics of land confiscation in Karen State—a longstanding problem previously documented by Human Rights Watch and local organizations such as the Karen Human Rights Group.[2] It details cases in which government officials, military personnel and agents on behalf of the army, local militia members, and businessmen have used intimidation and coercion to seize land and displace local people. It also documents the impact of land loss on local villagers, some of whom have farmed land for generations but lack legal documentation to prove it...";;;Human Rights Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;03-11-2016;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/70991;https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/11/03/farmer-becomes-criminal/human-rights-and-land-confiscation-karen-state;;;;

Specifically discussed are Tatmadaw and Border Guard abuses, including forced labour, portering, land confiscation, coercive land sale transactions, and damages to the villagers' livelihood. The community member mentioned that large amounts of the villagers' land were confiscated and damaged, as well as an increase in waterborne diseases, from gold mines that were initially operated by the DKBA, but now villagers are uncertain if the private parties who are negotiating permission to continue from the KNU will be allowed to continue the mines. This report also describes how Border Guard #1013 confiscated more than 75 acres of plantation land in order to build shelters for soldiers' families, which created direct problems for villagers livelihoods. Tatmadaw Infantry Battalion #96 has been forcing villagers to perform various work for the base and for soldiers on patrol, and demanded bamboo poles to repair their camp. Moe Win, a company second-in-command from Tatmadaw Light Infantry Division #44, sexually abused Naw C---, a married woman from T--- village, in her home while she, her baby, and her husband was sleeping.

The community member describes how Muh Theh villagers were forced by Tatmadaw LIB #704 Battalion Commander Nyan Win Aung to build a bridge across the Thay Nweh Loh River for the purpose of providing motorbike access from the village to Poh Khay Hkoh army camp, as well as providing information regarding taxes placed upon motorbike taxi drivers by soldiers from IB #60. The report goes on to provide details surrounding a campaign carried out by the KNU to inform villagers about the ceasefire process, during which villagers voiced their problems to the KNU, including land issues. Moreover, the report contains information about several pending, as well as current development projects in the area, including an incident in which Tatmadaw MOC #4 and LIB #704 facilitated the testing of stones in Maw Day Forest.

Location and General Description
This ecoregion is located within the Irrawaddy River Basin, the catchments of Bago Yoma, and the foothills of Rakhine Yoma. The soils belong to the Irrawaddian series, which consists of the fluvial sands with terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate fossils. Silicified wood fossils are found among ferruginous, calcareous, and siliceous concretions, with quartz pebbles. The Irrawaddian rocks are distinct from other Tertiary rock groups.

Myanmar is a resource-rich country that has abundant arable land, timber, mineral resources, natural gas and oil, which made it one of the best developing countries in South-East Asia until the early 1960s. Myanmar’s total area is 676 578 km2. Forest area is 317 730 km2, 48.32% of land area; other wooded land accounts for 30.59% of land area; other land accounts for 21.09% of land area, and inland water area is 19 030 km2 (FAO, 2010). Extensive changes in altitude and latitude produced a seemingly unparalleled abundance of habitats and species. Myanmar occupied completely or partially nine of the Global 200 Eco-regions (Olson and Dinerstein, 2002). Indo-Burma includes most of Myanmar is described as one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al., 2000). There is no doubt that Myanmar has an unmatched level of biological diversity. Myanmar has 7000 plant species, has 1027 known bird species, 4 of which are endemic, and 19 others are restricted range birds. Myanmar is also home to 300 known species of mammals, 425 reptile and amphibian species, and 350 freshwater fish, especially the endangered species such as the one-horned rhinoceros, the Irrawaddy Dolphin and the Gurney’s Pitta (BEWG, 2011)...";"Changjian Wang

By BadeiDha Moe Civil Society Organization.....

Summary:
""During the political reform period in Myanmar, most of the critical issues that have arisen around land
issues have concerned foreign investment projects. The civilian government, Houses of Parliament, Members of
Parliament, political parties, civil society and farmers are all directly involved and troubled by the land grabbing
that is taking place in the establishment of foreign investment projects. Among these projects, the Myanmar–
China pipelines project is having the most effects on the largest number of local people in Myanmar simply
because of its size: it crosses the entire length of the country from Rakhine State to Yunnan Province through
heavily populated and fertile agricultural areas. Because of its length, it affects all types of Myanmar
environmental resources such as cultivated land, virgin land, river, stream, forest and mountains, which are all
vital to Myanmar’s rich biodiversity. This one project has the potential to impact negatively on the environment,
livelihoods, culture and social life of a large part of the country. Local ethnic nationality groups have been
concerned about unfair compensation without the proper regard given to the environment and social impact.
State development should start with the involvement of people in each region. It is especially difficult for a
government to start development projects when there is political instability, and the impact of this project is an
impediment to the on-going peace process.
Our team surveyed ""public opinion'' on foreign investments, so-called development projects. Local
people voluntarily participated in the research in NgaPhe` Township, Upper Myanmar and Thipaw (Hsipaw)
Township, Northern Shan State.
The survey used participatory action research methods, in which local people could learn how to define
their issues, cooperate with each other and with civil society organisations, collect data on their situation and
understand their rights with respect to government and private company projects.
In summary, our report intends to expose the cases of injustice uncovered through our research to the
public, members of parliaments, and civil society";;;BadeiDha Moe Civil Society Organization;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;25-03-2014;en;"land use;extractive industries";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/77229;http://burmalibrary.org/docs17/BadeiDha_Moe-CSO-SIA_on.pdf;;;;

OBL:73763;Analysis of EIA for Phase I of Thilawa SEZ (English, Burmese (??????????);;"Conclusion: ""The Thilawa SEZ project is not clearly described and important information is missing
throughout the EIA document. The public consultation process did not involve all relevant
stakeholders, including affected communities, and did not provide sufficient information
in any case. Consequently, the consultation process did not meet international standards
and did not meet relevant JICA Guidelines. Had JICA provided adequate and appropriate
support for the EIA according to its Guidelines, it could have assured that the project
proponents were accounted for and planned to mitigate the negative social impacts that
are and will continue to result from the project. Already there have been substantial
impacts to local communities in Phase I as a result of relocation, including inadequate
compensation resulting in impoverishment, lost access to land, and reduced or lost
livelihoods. Thus, there is a direct link between JICA’s non-compliance with its Guidelines
and the injuries suffered by the relocated communities.
Furthermore, the analysis contained in the EIA is inadequate. Without further information
on the industries that will operate in the SEZ, it is impossible to assess and account for
the environmental and social impacts. Cumulative impacts are also ignored, and there is
little clarity as to why certain sites were selected for traffic or air testing or why waste
management data from an industrial zone in another country was used as a substitute
for actual information at the Thilawa SEZ.";;;EarthRights International;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2014;"en;my";"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/73763;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/ERI-2014-11-analysis_of_Thilawa_EIA-Phase_1-en-red.pdf;;;;
OBL:59272;Damming the Irrawaddy;;"Executive Summary: ""The Irrawaddy, one of Asia's great river systems which flows through Burma's heartlands, is about to be dammed. Burma's military junta is allowing Chinese companies to build a giant 152-meter-tall hydropower dam and transmit the electricity back to China. The dam is one in a series that the junta has planned involving the export of power to neighboring countries. While the regime will gain new revenues, Burma's ordinary citizens, who have no say in the process, will bear the costs.
A project-launching ceremony for the dam at the confluence (or Myitsone in Burmese), where the Irrawaddy begins, was held in May 2007 in Burma's northernmost Kachin State. The dam will generate 3,600 MW of electricity, most of which will be transmitted to China, fitting into the Chinese Central Government's 'West to East Power Transmission Policy' The power will be worth an estimated US$500 million per year. The Irrawaddy Myitsone dam is the first in a series of seven large Chinese dams to be built along this waterway.
Deeply concerned about the dam's potential impacts, elders, community leaders and villagers from across Kachin State have sent protest letters directly to Senior General Than Shwe and the military's Northern Commander to stop the project, but the objections have so far fallen on deaf ears.
An estimated 47 villages will be inundated in a region recognized as one of the world'seight ""hottest hotspots of biodiversity."" Approximately 10,000 people will be displaced, losing their livelihoods, and exacerbating the existing problems of unemployment, drug addiction and HIV/AIDS in the area. Roads that are the link betweenmajor towns in theremote state will be cutoffby the floods impacting communication, transportation, and trade.
Recent dam breaks in nearby rivers in 2006 have swept away houses and bridges, causing fatalities and destroying power stations and dam structures beyond repair. Northern Burma is earthquake-prone, and the Irrawaddy Myitsone dam site is less than 100 km from the major Sagaing fault line. Dam breakage or unnatural flood surges would be disastrous for Myitkyina, the capital city of Kachin State that lies only 40 kilometers downstream of the dam.
The well-documented negative impacts of large dams on fisheries, flood plain farming and river bank cultivation will impact the millions that rely on the Irrawaddy. Health concerns that include an increase in malaria and the release of toxic methyl-mercury from the dam's reservoir will endanger Burma's people, further burdening a healthcare system that is ranked as one of the worst in the world. The critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphin may become extinct in its namesake river.
Human rights abuses by the military have been extensively reported, including the junta's use of troops and landmines to secure large development projects, resulting in forced labor, land confiscation and threats to life. There is no reason to expect that the communities living at the Irrawaddy Myitsone dam site will not suffer the same consequences. Women are particularly susceptible to sexual violence by troops. In addition to these risks, women face pressures to participate in the sex trade once construction sites are set up and livelihoods are lost, and are increasingly vulnerable to human trafficking.
For centuries, the Myitsone has been the source of songs, poems and legends which are not only the heritage of the Kachin but all the people of Burma. If this dam were to go ahead, a national cultural landmark would be permanently submerged and lost to future generations.
The Kachin Development Networking Group (KDNG) joins those who have already spoken out to call for an end to the Irrawaddy Myitsone dam project. The ruling military junta is promoting mega-development that places all the costs and risks on disenfranchised peoples while fortifying military control. Small-scale alternatives that recognize the rights of local communities and empower them to participate and manage resources are possible. China is an important neighbor that can be a positive influence in the region. KDNG calls on China to abide at least by its own standards when operating in Burma and to heed the voices of affected peoples.";;;Kachin Development Networking Group (KDNG);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;22-10-2007;en;"displacement;sustainable development";"Land Conflicts;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59272;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/Damming-the-Irrawaddy-eng.pdf;;;;
OBL:74993;Governing the Commons;;The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatisation of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. Offering a critique of the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.;Elinor Ostrom;;Internet;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;;en;"customary law;customary tenure;common lands;land use;land tenure;natural resources management;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"035;MMR";Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74993;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/Ostrom-1990-governing_the_commons.pdf;;;;
OBL:74996;“We are not afraid” Land rights defenders: attacked for confronting unbridled development;;"The scale of attacks against land rights defenders is particularly preoccupying and should attract our utmost reaction and urgent mobilisation.
The toll they pay, together with their families and communities, is dramatic,
be it killings, forced disappearances, harassment or criminalisation. Caught
in the crossfire between poor land users fighting for the respect of their basic
human rights and powerful economic actors fighting for juicy profits, they
account as one of the most vulnerable categories of human rights defenders.
This particular vulnerability is due to various factors including the fact
that they challenge important economic interests pushed by powerful
actors such as States and corporations, the fact that they generally operate
in remote areas in which the rule of law is weak and the access to protection
mechanisms is difficult. Moreover, land rights defenders operate within a
weak legal framework governing land rights and land deals, in a global
context of intense pressures over land and resources.
Behind attacks against them, the situations on which they intervene
are those where authorities are shunning their obligation to ensure the
fulfilment of their human rights obligations. This, in turn, portrays a world
where development plans and investments impacting on land, are made
at the expense of the local users who depend on these lands for their
survival. Authorities and political actors often favour economic actors, be
they national or transnational ones, at the expense of the rights of their
own populations.
The balance of power becomes dramatically unequal and the efforts to
bring the respect for human rights at the centre of so-called development
are clearly insufficient...";;;Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (OMCT, FIDH);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2014;en;"forestry;land governance;land tenure;land tenure systems;security of tenure (land)";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74996;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/OMCT-FIDH-2014-Land_Rights_Defenders.pdf;;;;

The Need to Effectively Address Housing, Land and Property Rights
During Peace Negotiations and in the Context of Refugee/IDP Return:
Preliminary Recommendations to the Government of Myanmar,
Ethnic Actors and the International Community.....Executive Summary:
""Of the many challenging issues that will require resolution within the peace processes currently underway
between the government of Myanmar and various ethnic groups in the country, few will be as complex, sensitive
and yet vital than the issues comprising housing, land and property (HLP) rights. Viewed in terms of the rights of
the sizable internally displaced person (IDP) and refugee populations who will be affected by the eventual peace
agreements, and within the broader political reform process, HLP rights will need to form a key part of all of the
ongoing moves to secure a sustainable peace, and be a key ingredient within all activities dedicated to ending
displacement in Myanmar today.
The Government Myanmar (including the military) and its various ethnic negotiating partners – just as with all
countries that have undergone deep political transition in recent decades, including those emerging from lengthy
conflicts – need to fully appreciate and comprehend the nature and scale of the HLP issues that have emerged
in past decades, how these have affected and continue to affect the rights and perspectives of justice of those
concerned, and the measures that will be required to remedy HLP concerns in a fair and equitable manner that
strengthens the foundations for permanent peace. Resolving forced displacement and the arbitrary acquisition
and occupation of land, addressing the HLP and other human rights of returning refugees and IDPs in areas of
return, ensuring livelihood and other economic opportunities and a range of other measures will be required if
return is be sustainable and imbued with a sense of justice.
There is an acute awareness among all of those involved in the ongoing peace processes of the centrality of
HLP issues within the context of sustainable peace, however, all too little progress has thus far been made to
address these issues in any detail, nor have practical plans commenced to resolve ongoing displacement of either
refugees or IDPs. Indeed, the negotiating positions of both sides on key HLP issues differ sharply and will need
to be bridged; many difficult decisions remain to be made...";Scott Leckie;;Displacement Solutions;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;02-06-2013;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;land administration;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61389;http://burmalibrary.org/docs15/DS-Bridging_The_HLP_Gap-en.pdf;;;;

VI. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.... 
""Recent estimates indicate that up to two million people from Burma currently reside in Thailand, reflecting one of the largest migration flows in Southeast Asia. Many factors contribute to this mass exodus, but the vast majority of people leaving Burma are clearly fleeing persecution, fear and human rights abuses. While the initial reasons for leaving may be expressed in economic terms, underlying causes surface that explain the realities of their lives in Burma and their vulnerabilities upon return. Accounts given in Thailand, whether it be in the border camps, towns, cities, factories or farms, describe instances of forced relocation and confiscation of land; forced labor and portering; taxation and loss of livelihood; war and political oppression in Burma. Many of those who have fled had lived as internally displaced persons in Burma before crossing the border into Thailand. For most, it is the inability to survive or find safety in their home country that causes them to leave.

Once in Thailand, both the Royal Thai Government (RTG) and the international community have taken to classifying the people from Burma under specific categories that are at best misleading, and in the worst instances, dangerous. These categories distort the grave circumstances surrounding this migration by failing to take into account the realities that have brought people across the border. They also dictate people’s legal status within the country, the level of support and assistance that might be available to them and the degree of protection afforded them under international mechanisms. Consequently, most live in fear of deportation back into the hands of their persecutors or to the abusive environments from which they fled...""

Most of the villagers here are Karen, though there are also many Burmans living in the villages near the Sittaung River. Since late 1998 many Karens and Burmans have been fleeing their villages in the area because of human rights abuses by the State Peace & Development Council (SPDC) military junta which currently rules Burma, and this flight is still ongoing. Those from the hills which cover most of the District are fleeing because SPDC troops have been systematically destroying their villages, crops and food supplies and shooting villagers on sight, all in an effort to undermine the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) by driving the civilian population out of the region. At the same time, people in the plains near the Sittaung River are fleeing because of the ever-increasing burden of forced labour, cash extortion, and heavy crop quotas which are being levied against them even though their crops have failed for the past two years running. Many are also fleeing a frightening new phenomenon in the District: the Sa Thon Lon Guerrilla Retaliation units, which appeared in September 1998 and since then have been systematically executing everyone suspected of even the remotest contact with the opposition forces, even if that contact occurred years or decades ago. Their methods are brutal, their tactics are designed to induce fear, and they have executed anywhere from 50 to over 100 civilians in the District since September 1998...;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;24-05-1999;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/50904;http://www.khrg.org/khrg99/khrg9904.html;;;;

In the thousands of interviews conducted by the Karen Human Rights Group with villagers who have fled their homes, approximately 95 percent say they have not fled military battles, but rather the systematic destruction of their ability to survive, caused by demands and retaliations inflicted on them by the SPDC military. Where there is fighting, it is fluid and sporadic, and most villagers can avoid it by hiding for short periods in the forest. Once the SPDC occupies the area around their village, however, the suffering is inescapable.

""The Global Climate Risk Index 2013 analyses to
what extent countries have been affected
by the impacts of weather-related loss events
(storms, floods, heat waves etc.). The most
recent available data from 2011 as well as for the period 1992-2011 were taken into ac-
count.
Most affected countries in 2011 were Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, El Salvador and the
Philippines. For the period 1992 to 2011, Honduras, Myanmar and Nicaragua rank highest.
This year's 8th edition of the an
alysis reconfirms that less developed countries are generally
more affected than industrialis
ed countries, according to the
Climate Risk Index. With re-
gard to future climate change, the Climate Ri
sk Index can serve as a warning signal indicat-

OBL:61563;Pushed to the Brink - Conflict and human trafficking on the Kachin-China border;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ""The Burmese government’s renewed war against the Kachin has exponentially increased the risk
of human trafficking along the China-Burma border. New documentation by KWAT indicates that large-scale
displacement, lack of refugee protection and shortages of humanitarian aid have become significant new push
factors fuelling the trafficking problem.
Burma Army offensives against the Kachin Independence Army since June 2011 and widespread human rights
abuses have driven over 100,000 villagers from their homes, mainly in eastern Kachin State. The majority of
these refugees have fled to crowded IDP camps along the China border, which receive virtually no international
aid. Desperate to earn an income, but with little or no legal option to pursue migrant work in China, many cross
the border illegally. Their lack of legal status renders them extremely vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers,
who use well-trodden routes to transport and sell people into bonded labor or forced marriage as far as eastern
provinces of China.
Although ongoing attacks and massive social upheaval since the start of the conflict have hampered systematic
data collection, KWAT has documented 24 trafficking cases from Kachin border areas since June 2011, mostly
involving young women and girls displaced by the war, who have been tricked, drugged, raped, and sold to
Chinese men or families as brides or bonded laborers. The sale of women and children is a lucrative source
of income for traffickers, who can make as much as 40,000 Yuan (approximately $6,500 USD) per person.
While some manage to escape, and may be assisted by Chinese authorities in returning home, others disappear
without a trace.
Kachin authorities and community-based groups have played a key role in providing help with trafficking
cases, and assisting women to be reunited with their families. No trafficked women or their families sought
help from Burmese authorities. The Burmese government lists an anti-trafficking border liaison office at Loije
on the Kachin-China border, but it is unknown to the community and thought to be non-functional.
Far from seeking to provide protection to the internally displaced persons (IDPs) and mitigate trafficking risks,
the Burmese government has continued to fuel the war, block humanitarian aid to IDPs in Kachin controlled
areas, and even attack and destroy IDP camps, driving refugees into China. It has also closed some of the
immigration offices on the Kachin-China border which could provide border passes for refugees to legally seek
work in China.
It is thus ironic that in 2012, Burma was recognized in the U.S. State Department’s Annual Trafficking in
Persons Report as increasing its efforts in combating human trafficking, resulting in a rise from its bottomlevel
ranking for the first time in the history of the report, and a corresponding increase in financial support to
Burma’s quasi-civilian government.
It is urgently needed to address the structural problems that have led to mass migration and trafficking in the
past and also spurred the recent conflict. The Burmese military’s gross mismanagement of resource revenues
from Kachin State over the past few decades, and ongoing land confiscation, forced relocation, and human
rights abuses, have pushed countless Kachin civilians across the Chinese border in search of peace and the
fulfillment of basic needs. These problems led to the breakdown of the 17-year ceasefire between the Kachin
Independence Army (KIA) and the military-dominated government in 2011. Refusing to engage in dialogue
to address Kachin demands for equality and equitable development, the government launched attacks to seize
total control over the wealth of resources in Kachin State.
Resolving the current conflict via genuine political dialogue would not only be a step towards peace, but
also a concrete move towards curbing human trafficking from Kachin areas. Launching a range of reforms
dealing with the political and economic factors driving people beyond Burma’s borders is critical to addressing
trafficking. Therefore, KWAT recommends the following:...";;;Kachin Women’s Association Thailand (KWAT);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-06-2013;en;"land conflicts;displacement";Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61563;http://burmalibrary.org/docs15/KWAT-pushed_to_the_brink-en-red.pdf;;;;

OBL:65114;Grabbing Land: Destructive Development in Ta'ang Region (Burmese);;This report validates the fact that multi-national and transnational companies are violating the Ta'ang ethnic nationals' fundamental human rights. The confiscation of Ta'ang peoples' land and the exploitation of their natural resources in which they depend for their subsistence and livelihood are outlined in this report. The Myanmar government continues to permit the persistence of business practices which are illegal under national and international laws. Massive displacements take place without the provisions of adequate compensation or relocation, let alone meaningful community consultations that left the affected people with no legal remedy to rebuild their lives and resume their collective activity. The situation of Ta'ang people in the Shan State is a classic example of land confiscation under the pretext of economic development while totally excluding the affected communities on the benefits of 'development' from foreign investment in the country. As a consequence of these activities the Ta'ang people have to bear the brunt of not only losing their land and source of livelihood, but as well as the practice of forced labor by the SPDC against the Ta'ang people. This forced labor facilitates private companies' projects at the expense of the already displaced community. In this situation, the women, children and the elderly are also disproportionately affected. This report lays testament to the sufferings of the Ta'ang people. This wanton violation of Ta'ang ethnic nationals' rights is representative of the emblematic and widespread disregard for the fundamental rights in Myanmar. It is an outright violation of a number of international laws which include the United Nations Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), the violation of the International Labor Organisation (1930, No. 29, Article 2.1). It is also a breach on their commitment as UN member state to the UN Declaration on the Right to Development adopted in 1986 and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011). Yet, international and regional intergovernmental body such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is playing deaf and blind in addressing the situation to put an end to these illegal practices. It is hoped that this report could facilitate the necessary steps and concrete action in behalf of the Ta'ang ethnic nationals which are required from the relevant UN agencies, international and regional bodies, international financial institutions, and the bilateral and multi-lateral donor agencies. The stories collected in this report speak for the longstanding issues that beset the Ta'ang S ethnic nationals and the efforts of the Ta'ang Students and Youth Organisation in publishing this report is a very important step in trying to make a significant contribution to change that situation, now and for the generations to come. As this report shows, this situation could not continue as if it is business as usual. There is no way forward but for a multi-level dialogue to take place and agree on an amicable settlement which is in line with the national and international laws.

OBL:74285;MIDNIGHT INTRUSIONS - Ending Guest Registration and Household Inspections in Myanmar (English);;"SUMMARY:
""Since President

Thein

Sein

came

to

power

in

2011,

political

and

economic

reforms

in

Myanmar

have

led

to

greater

freedoms

and

unprecedented

optimism

for

the

country’s

future.

However,

in

communities

throughout

Myanmar,

authorities

continue

to

apply

repressive

laws

and

employ

practices

common

under

previous

military

regimes.

The

Ward or Village Tract Administration Law
requires

all

residents

of

Myanmar—urban

and

rural,

Burman

Buddhists

and

minorities,

rich

and

poor—to

report

the

identity

of

overnight

houseguests

to

government

officials

serving

as

ward

or

village

tract

administrators.

In

effect,

residents

need

permission

from

the

state

to

host

overnight

guests—and

authorities

are

known

to

deny

guest

registration

for

a

variety

of

reasons.
Myanmar

authorities

ensure

compliance

with

the

guest

registration

requirement

by

conducting

periodic

household

inspections.


The

Ward or Village Tract Administration Law

empowers

officials

to

inspect

“the 
places

needed

to

examine

for

prevalence

of

law

and

order

and

upholding

the

discipline

[sic]
,”

effectively

giving

them

unfettered

authority

to

enter

private

residences.

Under

the

authority

granted

by

this

provision,

ward

or

village

tract

administrators

typically

carry

out

household

inspections

late

at

night

with

police

or

intelligence

officers

and

others,

ostensibly

to

determine

if

unregistered

guests

are

present.

Given

the

timing

of

these

intrusions,

many

residents

refer

to

the

practice

as

“midnight

inspections”.

Additionally,

individuals

who

lack

adequate

documentation

or

citizenship

status

in

Myanmar

face

challenges

hosting

or

staying

as

overnight

guests.

For

example,

individuals

who

are

unable

to

obtain

household

registration

documents

are

typically

required

to

regularly

report

themselves

to

the

state

as

guests

in

their

own

homes,

often

on

a

weekly

basis.

The

provisions

of

the

Ward or Village Tract Administration Law

related

to

the

guest

registration

requirement

and

its

enforcement

impinge

on

various

human

rights,

including

the

right

to

privacy

and

rights

to

freedom

of

movement,

residency,

and

association.

The

guest

registration

requirement

represents

a

systematic

and

nationwide

breach

of

privacy,

giving

the

government

access

to

troves

of

personal

data

from

communities

across

the

country.

Evidence

collected

by

Fortify

Rights

also

suggests

that

the

law

is

particularly

enforced

against

low-income

communities,

Second, a case study in the rice deficit region (Dry Zone) will present the characteristics and food security status of the farm and non-farm rural households (landless) and the determinants of food security. The Dry Zone was chosen to study because the EC & FAO (2007) classified this region as the most vulnerable area of the country. Furthermore, the FAO projected that the Net Primary Production would be decreased significantly in the Dry Zone in the next two decades. It is essential to collect the primary and secondary data on food availability, access, stability and utilization for understanding the current reality of food security at both macro and micro level...
 Objectives of the Study:
> To assess the food (rice) availability at the national level by using indicators of trend of production index, growth rate of sown area, production and yield, average availability of rice, average per capita rice consumption, rice surplus, dietary energy supply of rice, share of food expenditure in total budget, self-sufficiency ratio, trends in domestic prices of rice and the estimated effects of the Nargis cyclone on rice self-sufficiency.
> To investigate the rural household's access to food in terms of human capital, food production, household income, asset ownership, and income diversification of farm and non-farm (landless) households.
> To examine the farm and non-farm household's food security status by applying the national food poverty line and the index of coping strategies method along with some indicators such as food share in the household budget, percentage of food expenditure in the total household income, and nutrition security indicators of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, diseases, and number of children death.";Dolly Kyaw;;Institute of Developing Economies, Japan External Trade Organization;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-01-2009;en;"food security;farmers;rural population;sustainable development;poverty;rural development;local community";"Land & Food Security;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/55971;http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Vrf/pdf/444.pdf;;;;

""...Linkages between militarisation and food scarcity in Burma were
established by civilian testimonies from ten out of the fourteen states and
divisions to a People’s Tribunal in the late 1990s. Since then the scale of
internal displacement has dramatically increased, with the population in
eastern Burma during 2002 having been estimated at 633,000 people, of
whom approximately 268,000 were in hiding and the rest were interned
in relocation sites. This report attempts to complement these earlier
assessments by appraising the current relationship between food security
and internal displacement in eastern Burma. It is hoped that these
contributions will, amongst other impacts, assist the Asian Human Rights
Commission’s Permanent People’s Tribunal to promote the right to food
and rule of law in Burma...

Personal observations and field surveys by community-based organisations
in eastern Burma suggest that a vicious cycle linking the deprivation of
food security with internal displacement has intensified. Compulsory paddy
procurement, land confiscation, the Border Areas Development program
and spiraling inflation have induced displacement of the rural poor away
from state-controlled areas. In war zones, however, the state continues to
destroy and confiscate food supplies in order to force displaced villagers
back into state-controlled areas. An image emerges of a highly vulnerable
and frequently displaced rural population, who remain extremely resilient
in order to survive based on their local knowledge and social networks.
Findings from the observations and field surveys include the following:...";;;The Border Consortium;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-09-2003;en;"agricultural land management;food security;farmers;land governance;displacement;indigenous peoples;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/46160;http://burmalibrary.org/docs/BBC-Reclaiming_the_Right_to_Rice.pdf;;;;
OBL:46163;Capitalizing on Conflict: How Logging and Mining Contribute to Environmental Destruction in Burma.;;"#039;Capitalizing on Conflict' presents information illustrating how trade in timber, gems,
and gold is financing violent conflict, including widespread and gross human rights
abuses, in Burma. Although trade in these “conflict goods” accounts for a small
percentage of the total global trade, it severely compromises human security and
undermines socio-economic development, not only in Burma, but throughout the
region.
Ironically, cease-fire agreements signed between the late 1980s and early 1990s
have dramatically expanded the area where businesses operate. While many
observers have have drawn attention to the political ramifications of these ceasefires,
little attention has been focused on the economic ramifications. These ceasefires,
used strategically by the military regime to end fighting in some areas and
foment intra-ethnic conflict in others and weaken the unity of opposition groups,
have had a net effect of increasing violence in some areas.
Capitalizing on Conflict focuses on two zones where logging and mining are both
widespread and the damage from these activities is severe... Both case
studies highlight the dilemmas cease-fire arrangements often pose for the local
communities, which frequently find themselves caught between powerful and
conflicting military and business interests. The information provides insights into the
conditions that compel local communities to participate in the unsustainable
exploitation of their own local resources, even though they know they are destroying
the very ecosystems they depend upon to maintain their way of life. The other
alternative — to stand aside and let outsiders do it and then be left with nothing — is
equally unpalatable...""

In a major administrative reorganisation in 2003, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) appointed a Prime Minister who subsequently presented a seven-point road map for a democratic transition in Myanmar. The first step in this process is the reconvening of the national convention to draft a new constitution for the country. The road map has been welcomed by the UN Secretary-General, who urged that it be implemented in an “all inclusive manner”.
Most of the 17 armed ethnic groups who have reached a ceasefire agreement with the SPDC have had consultations with the new Prime Minister, and announced their willingness to join the national convention process. In an unprecedented development, the Kayin National Union (KNU), which has been engaged in active armed conflict with the regime in Myanmar for the past 50 years, reached a verbal ceasefire agreement with the SPDC in December 2003.

Driven out by the ruling military regime’s policies and practices that suppress their freedom and violate their human rights, refugees and asylum seekers have fled to countries including Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Thailand. Refugees flee forced labor, forced relocation, torture, rape, and other human rights violations perpetrated by members of the Tatmadaw (armed forces) or other State sponsored individuals or organizations. As the SPDC continues to try and eliminate all armed and unarmed resistance, the military presence and involvement in every area of the country and all aspects of life continues to grow, forcing many to leave their homes fleeing to neighboring countries or to become displaced within Burma. There are an estimated one million internally displaced people in Burma who have the potential to become cross border refugees in times of increased military conflict.

 

In Thailand, the U.S. Committee for Refugees reports a population of over 400,000 refugees, the majority of whom are from Karen, Karenni, Mon, and Shan ethnic groups. At the same time, there are more than one million migrant workers in Thailand who go there for many of the same reasons as refugees. A new trend is more ethnic Burmese leaving Burma from both urban and rural areas in family groups.

In addition, thousands of people living in the area are at risk from Myanmar Wanbao’s inadequate management of environmental risk at the Letpadaung mine, which is situated in a flood and earthquake-prone area. The ESIA for the mine contains fundamental gaps and weaknesses, which Myanmar Wanbao has still not addressed.
In 2015, Amnesty International concluded that the Myanmar government must halt the development of the Letpadaung mine until the human rights and environmental concerns were addressed. In May 2016 the mine began producing copper, but those human rights and environmental concerns have still not been addressed. Amnesty International is repeating its call therefore for the mine’s operations to be suspended, while these concerns are dealt with.
Amnesty International is also repeating its call for the government of Myanmar to urgently act to prevent human rights abuses at the Letpadaung and S&K mines and provide effective remedy for the human rights abuses that people there have already suffered. The authorities must stop using draconian laws to charge and harass villagers participating in peaceful protests against the mine project.
More broadly, the Myanmar government needs to strengthen the legal framework, to improve the regulation of large projects, such as mines, and put in place an adequate framework for land acquisition that is based on international standards on the right to adequate housing and the prohibition of forced evictions. Both the government of Myanmar and Myanmar Wanbao must also ensure an effective remedy for the human rights abuses that people there have already suffered.

""Economic Disparity in Rural Myanmar"" by Ikuko Okamoto. National University of Singapore Press, 2008...
""THE devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis and spiraling global food prices have placed even more pressure on the agricultural sector of Burma, once the world’s largest rice exporter and potentially one of Asia’s most prodigious producers of agricultural staples.

The majority of the Burmese labor pool is in farming, and rice production remains not just a national priority but an obsession of the junta. Successive regimes have attempted a number of initiatives to increase agricultural production, first through disastrous socialist policies, and since 1988 with piecemeal open market reforms which have continued to stifle the true promise of the agricultural sector.

Ikuko Okamoto’s book looks at one success story in this sad litany of state failure. Economic Disparity in Rural Myanmar is an academic analysis of the rapid increase in production of pulses in one township close to Rangoon. A pulse is a bean, in this case one called pedishwewar, or golden green gram, otherwise known as the mung bean.

It is a close study of the relationship between Burmese farm laborers, rural traders, tractor dealers, some available land, rice paddy crops and a fortuitous gap in the global rice market that produced a pulse market where before there was none. The sting is that most of the people on the lower rungs—the farmer-laborers—profited least from their labors.

Pulses brought in a total of 3.6 billion kyat (US $3 million) in 2007, mainly due to India, which reduced pulse cultivation, allowing farmers and traders in Burma to fill the demand.

Okamoto, a researcher at Japan’s Institute for Developing Economies, spent several years studying production techniques in Thongwa Township, east of Rangoon and home to 64 villages and about 150,000 people.

In this well-designed and detailed study, she looks at how the dramatic growth in green gram production produced an export success...";David Scott Mathieson;;The Irrawaddy;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-06-2008;en;"sustainable development;rural population;farmers;poverty;rural development;local community";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/58137;http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13200;;;;

OBL:45128;Burma's Dirty War - The humanitarian crisis in eastern Burma;;"Up to a million people have fled their homes in eastern Burma in a crisis the world has largely ignored.

Burma's refusal to release Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, and the boycotting of the constitutional convention this month by the main opposition, has thrust Burma into the spotlight again.

But unseen and largely unremarked is the ongoing harrowing experience of hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Burma, hiding in the jungle or trapped in army-controlled relocation sites. Others are in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border.

These people are victims in a counterinsurgency war in which they are the deliberate targets. As members of Burma's ethnic minorities - which make up 40 per cent of the population - they are trapped in a conflict between the Burmese army and ethnic minority armies.

Surviving on caches of rice hidden in caves, or on roots and wild foods, families in eastern Burma face malaria, landmines, disease and starvation. They are hunted like animals by army patrols and starved into surrender.

In interviews... refugees told Christian Aid of murder and rape, the torching of villages and shooting of family members as they lay huddled together in the fields. They recalled farmers who had been blown up by landmines laid by the army around their crops.

This report, based on personal testimonies from refugees, tells the story of Burma's humanitarian crisis.

On the brink of the Burmese government's announcement of a 'roadmap to democracy' for a new constitution, Burma's Dirty War argues that any new political settlement must include the crisis on the country's eastern borders.

Burma's refusal to free Aung San Suu Kyi promises more intransigence and an even slower pace of change - with predictable human costs.

This report calls on the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the UN to use what opportunity remains from the roadmap to democracy to press for an end to the conflict in negotiations with ethnic minorities.

It also argues that the UN must gain access to the areas in crisis - despite the Burmese government ban on travel there by humanitarian agencies.

Key recommendations include:

 * that the Burmese government cease human rights abuses, allow access to eastern Burma by humanitarian agencies including UN special representatives, and engage in dialogue with ethnic minority representatives

 * that the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the UN fund work with displaced people inside Burma and continue to support refugees in Thailand

 * that the UK and Irish governments, the EU and UN Security Council condemn Burma's human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, demand that it protect civilians from violence and insist that Burma allow access to humanitarian agencies

The report argues that governments must seize the opportunity presented by the roadmap to push for genuine negotiations between the government, the National League for Democracy and ethnic minority organisations which can bring out a just and lasting peace...";;;Christian Aid;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;24-05-2004;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/45128;http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/4A7341617D94257249256E9F000BDA6C-chraid-mmr-24may.pdf;;;;

OBL:58621;Labor Contracts, Incentives, and Food Security in Rural Myanmar;;"Abstract:
""This paper develops an agency model of contract choice in the hiring of labor and then uses the model to estimate the determinants of contract choice in rural Myanmar. As a salient feature relevant for the agricultural sector in a low income country such as Myanmar, the agency model incorporates considerations of food security and incentive effects. It is shown that when, possibly due to poverty, food considerations are important for employees, employers will prefer a labor contract with wages paid in kind (food) to one with wages paid in cash. At the same time, when output is responsive to workers' effort and labor monitoring is costly, employers will prefer a contract with piecerate
 wages to one with hourly wages. The case of sharecropping can be understood as a combination of the two: a labor contract with piecerate
 wages paid in kind. The predictions of the theoretical model are tested using a crosssection
 dataset collected in rural Myanmar through a sample household survey which was conducted in 2001 and covers diverse agroecological
 environments. The estimation results are consistent with the theoretical predictions: wages are more likely to be paid in kind when the share of staple food in workers' budget is higher and the farmland on which they produce food themselves is smaller; piecerate
 wages are more likely to be adopted when work effort is more difficult to monitor and the farming operation requires quick completion...

Thematic Study:

""This thematic study explores the importance of customary tenure for rural Cambodians with the aim of strengthening its recognition. It begins with an overview of customary arrangements in the country, and their significance for the livelihoods and wellbeing of rural communities. This is followed by a discussion of the recognition of customary tenure in the Cambodian legal system, and the challenges confronted in the implementation of legal provisions. The third section examines the impacts of market driven land polices on vulnerable customary users, particularly the granting of economic land concessions and private land titling. Mechanisms – both formal and informal – for settling land disputes are also briefly examined. The final part of the paper identifies key opportunities to increase the recognition and protection of customary tenure in Cambodia and lays out recommendations for policy influence and for strengthening alliances, community rights and representation.

Updated Content: Mine Action...



Mines are believed to be concentrated on Myanmar’s borders with Bangladesh and Thailand, but are a particular threat in eastern parts of the country as a result of decades of post-independence struggles for autonomy by ethnic minorities. Some 47 townships in Kachin, Karen (Kayin), Karenni (Kayah), Mon, Rakhine, and Shan states, as well as in Pegu (Bago) and Tenasserim (Tanintharyi) divisions[1] suffer from some degree of mine contamination, primarily from antipersonnel mines. Karen (Kayin) state and Pegu (Bago) division are suspected to contain the heaviest mine contamination and have the highest number of recorded victims. The Monitor has also received reports of previously unknown suspect hazardous areas (SHAs) in townships on the Indian border of Chin state.[2]

No estimate exists of the extent of contamination, but the Monitor identified SHAs in the following divisions and townships:

 Karenni state: all seven townships;
 Karen state: all seven townships;

Ore produced in the region is sold to China at around US $3,000 per ton with the LWO accusing Burmese companies such Sai Laung Hein, U Myint Aung, Hein Lin San and Wunna Thein Than of running the mining operations.

The Pa-O in the Thaton area have become ""Burmanized"" -- like their neighbors the Mon and Karen, they have adopted Burmese language, dress and customs. The Pa-O in southwestern Shan State have learned to speak Shan, but have maintained their own distinct language and customs, including their traditional dark blue or black dress. Among the earliest Pa-O arrivals in Thailand may have been slaves captured by the Karenni and sold into Siam in the mid and late 1800s. During the 1880s, the Shan States were in chaos, the local princes at war with each other. Large numbers of people fled, many into northern Thailand, very likely including some Pa-O. The Pa-O also went to Thailand as traders of cattle as well as herbal medicines and other trade goods. More recently they have gone as refugees. 

Forced relocations have been particularly sweeping in Mon, Karen and Shan States -- those states where most of the Pa-O live. The Pa-O Nationalist Army signed a ceasefire with SLORC in 1991, but because the Pa-O live in many of the areas where other rebel groups are still active they have been swept up in the forced relocations and human rights abuses for which the ruling junta has become infamous.

OBL:72001;INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND LOCAL COMMUNITY TENURE IN THE INDCS - Status and Recommendations;;"... In December 2015, representatives of governments, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples’ groups, and the private sector met in Paris for the 21st
 Conference of Parties (COP 21) of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The aim of this meeting was to determine a global path forward that would limit the rise in global temperature to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and allow countries to reach peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon 
as possible.

With its recognition of the crucial role that forests play in achieving targeted emissions reductions, the Paris Agreement marks a major turning point in the global struggle to combat climate change. Yet, the final 
Agreement lacks key considerations for the Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IP/LCs) who have customary rights to a large portion of the world’s remaining tropical forests, as well as millions of hectares of degraded forests that could capture additional carbon through restoration. 

Although Indigenous Peoples and civil society groups from around the world advocated throughout the negotiation process that clear provisions securing IP/LC land tenure would be essential components of any successful and equitable climate agreement, text on the rights of IP/LCs 
was limited to the preamble. Ultimately, the Paris Agreement failed to take into account the significance of community land rights and community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) for realizing its ambitious goals. 
This brief presents a review of 161 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted on behalf of 188 countries for COP 21 to determine the extent to which Parties made clear commitments to strengthen or expand the tenure and natural resource management rights of IP/LCs as part of their climate change mitigation plans or associated 
adaptation actions.

OBL:72006;Determinants of Local People's Perceptions and Attitudes Toward a Protected Area and Its Management: A Case Study From Popa Mountain Park, Central Myanmar;;"... Without local support, the long-term existence of PAs is not assured (Wells and McShane 2004). Local people are unlikely to support PAs if they have negative perceptions
and attitudes toward them (Alkan et al. 2009). An attitude is a cognitive evaluation of a particular entity with favor or disfavor, and it reflects the beliefs that people hold about the attitude object or entity (Eagly and Chaiken 1998). Beliefs are the associations that people establish between the attitude object and various attributes (Allendorf 2007). Attitudes toward PAs, conservation, or wildlife may be influenced by PA staff or management interventions, local economic needs and history, or other indirectly related socioeconomic factors such as government policy. The cognitions or thoughts that are associated with attitudes are typically termed beliefs by attitude theorists (Eagly and Chaiken 1998). Perception refers to people’s beliefs that derive from their experiences and interaction with a program or activity. Xu et al. (2006) argue that local people’s perceptions are related to costs and benefits produced by PAs, their dependence on PA resources, and their knowledge about PAs.

The influences of socioeconomic characteristics on local people’s perceptions and attitudes toward an adjacent PA are often site-specific and inconsistent (Allendorf et al. 2006; Baral and Heinen 2007; Mehta and Heinen 2001; Rao et al. 2003; Shibia 2010; Shrestha and Alavalapati 2006; Xu et al. 2006). Some studies report that education is a strong predictor of attitude (Allendorf et al. 2006; Mehta and Heinen 2001; Shibia 2010; Shrestha and Alavalapati 2006; Xu et al. 2006), while others have found no correlation between educational status and people’s perceptions and attitudes (Baral and Heinen 2007; Mehta and Heinen 2001). Mehta and Heinen (2001), Allendorf et al. (2006), and Xu et al. (2006) reported that women were less likely to hold positive attitudes, whereas Baral and Heinen (2007) and Shibia (2010) found no correlation between gender and attitude. Allendorf et al. (2006) and Shrestha and Alavalapati (2006) found that individuals from larger families have negative attitudes to PAs, whereas Xu et al. (2006) reported that individuals from larger families
hold positive attitudes toward PAs.

Jim and Xu (2002) and Alkan et al. (2009) argue that local people’s perceptions and attitudes are shaped by their knowledge about the neighboring PA. This knowledge might include objectives, activities, size, regulations, or location of the boundary of PAs (Jim and Xu 2002; Rao et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2006). The knowledge is gained empirically through one’s perceptions, and it is the recognition of something sensed or felt (Ziadat 2010). It is important to investigate whether more knowledge of PAs
would be associated with positive perceptions and attitudes toward them. We examined the effects of both knowledge and socioeconomic factors on the perceptions and attitudes of local people toward Popa Mountain Park, in central Myanmar, and its management through a questionnaire survey.

Myanmar is one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world, and its PAs play a crucial role in conserving the country’s rich biodiversity (Myers et al. 2000). During the last 10 years the number of protected areas in Myanmar has increased from 20 to 42, covering 7.3% of total land area of the country (Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division 2008). The Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division (NWCD)
of the Forest Department, Ministry of Forestry, is mainly responsible for PA management in Myanmar. Generally, PAs in Myanmar can be categorized into national park, marine park, wildlife sanctuary, nature reserve, and zoo park. Although

Myanmar’s PAs do not fully conform to PA categories of the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), they are most similar to IUCN category IV (Aung 2007).

Myanmar’s PA management rules and regulations prohibit local people from using resources within PAs. Conflicts arise as local people often have no other source of resource than the PA. Rao, Rabinowitz, and Khaing (2002) reported that nontimber forest products were extracted from 85% and fuelwood was collected from more than 50% of PAs in Myanmar. The mean annual population growth rate is 2.1%
(Central Statistics Organisation 2006) and is highest in rural areas where most Myanmar PAs are located. Population increase is linked to an increase in the number of people seeking land for grazing, collecting fuelwood, and extracting timber and other forest products. The rapid growth of PAs and the huge pressures placed on them by the increasing human population are a great challenge for sustainable PA management.

Popa Mountain Park (PMP) possesses a diverse forest ecosystem in central Myanmar where most forests have already disappeared. PMP was selected for the present study for two reasons: (1) a historic relationship between PMP and local communities and (2) high people’s pressure on the park resulting from the high population density together with resource scarcity in the surrounding area. The Forest Department has had great success in the reforestation of Popa Mountain, which is a high priority for forest conservation. It is important to understand local people’s perceptions and attitudes toward PMP for its sustainability. The objectives of the present study were (1) to examine the responses of local people toward the
park and its management and (2) to study how local people’s perceptions and attitudes toward the PA and its management relate to their socioeconomic status and knowledge about the park...";"Naing Zaw Htun

OBL:72007;Myanmar Protected Areas: Context, Current Status and Challenges;;"... Protected areas (PAs) are important tools for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. PAs safeguard ecosystems and their services, such as water provision, food production, carbon sequestration and climate regulation, thus improving people’s livelihoods. They preserve the integrity of spiritual and cultural values placed by indigenous people on wild areas and offer opportunities of inspiration, study and recreation. Due to a long period of isolation, Myanmar has conserved an extraordinary natural and cultural heritage that is in part represented in its protected area system. The expansion of agriculture and industry, pollution, population growth, along with uncontrolled use and extraction of resources, are causing severe environmental and ecosystem degradation. Loss of biodiversity is the most pressing environmental problem because species extinction is irreversible. Realising the urgency of Myanmar environmental challenges, several stakeholders, at national, international and regional level, have committed to support conservation and management of PAs. However, baseline information on natural resources, threats, management, staff, infrastructure, land use, tourism and research in Myanmar PAs was hardly ever updated and not systematically organised, thus limiting the subsequent planning and management of resources. Therefore, the aim of this publication is twofold: to raise awareness on the condition of the conservation of PAs and to mobilise national and international support for cost-effective initiatives, innovative approaches and targeted research in priority sites. The document provides background information on Myanmar natural features, environmental,
government and non-government frameworks (Chapter 1).
The core section makes available the information retrieved in the period 2009-2010 on the status of Myanmar PAs (Chapter 2) and the results of the research conducted in Lampi Island Marine National Park (Chapter 3) and Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range Wildlife Reserve (Chapter 4). Data collection, analysis and organisation were part of the larger Myanmar Environmental Project (MEP) managed by Istituto Oikos in partnership with BANCA. Conclusion and recommendations for the management of Myanmar PAs (Chapter 5) were jointly formulated by stakeholders during the MEP closing workshop held on March 17th 2011 in Yangon. The information presented in this publication is also organised in a database available to stakeholders that will be updated with new data provided by PA managers, academic institutions, environmental organisations and community-based groups working in Myanmar PAs to fill the existing gaps...";"Lara Beffasti

OBL:59285;Internal Displacement in Eastern Burma, 2007 Survey;;"The Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) has been collaborating with ethnic community-based organisations to document the characteristics of internal displacement in eastern Burma since 2002. This year's research updates estimates of the scale and distribution of internal displacement, and documents the impacts of militarization and state-sponsored development, based on quantitative surveys with key informants in 38 townships. Trends relating to vulnerability, coping strategies and efforts at promoting protection were assessed by utilizing a multi-stage cluster sampling method to select and interview almost 1,000 households spread across six states and divisions.
This year's survey has identified 273 infantry and light infantry battalions active in eastern Burma, representing more than 30% of the Burmese Army's battalions nationwide. These troops are generally controlled by the State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC's) Coastal Command based in Mergui, South Eastern Command in Moulmein, Southern Command in Taungoo, Eastern Command in Taunggyi and Triangle Area Command in Keng Tung. Documentation in this report reflects that human rights violations committed by the Burmese Army as part of their counter-insurgency strategy are tantamount to crimes against humanity and remain a key cause of displacement. However, even the SPDC's military hierarchy has admitted that poor troop management, inadequate rations and harsh conditions resulted in low morale and an 8% increase in desertion during the past year.
Rather than alleviating poverty, state-sponsored development initiatives primarily facilitate the consolidation of military control over rural communities and induce displacement. Local livelihoods in areas surrounding proposed hydro-electric dams along the Salween River have been further undermined during the past year, with additional troop deployments to the Hutgyi dam site in Karen State during September particularly notable. Similarly, the livelihoods of Mon villagers continue to be undermined by the imposition of forced labour to secure the gas pipeline transporting electricity to Thailand. The government's promotion of castor oil plantations has become more systematic, with reports of land confiscation, extortion and forced cultivation especially significant in Southern Shan State. Palm oil and rubber plantations operated as joint ventures between local Burmese Army commanders and foreign investors have caused similar problems in Tenasserim Division, Meanwhile over 3,000 acres of farm land was confiscated in northern Karenni State to pave the way for an industrial estate.
Approximately 76,000 people were forced to leave their homes as a result of, or in order to avoid, the effects of armed conflict and human rights abuses during the past year. The number of people displaced was slightly lower than last year, which was primarily related to a relaxation of restrictions in Tenasserim Division. Forced migration was most concentrated in northern Karen State and eastern Pegu Division where counter-insurgency operations displaced approximately 43,000 civilians. While the total number of deaths in these four townships is unknown, at least 38 villagers have been killed by the Burmese Army during 2007 in Thandaung township alone.
TBBC has previously reported that more than 3,000 villages were destroyed, forcibly relocated or otherwise abandoned in eastern Burma between 1996 and 2006. These field reports have recently been corroborated by high resolution commercial satellite imagery taken before and after the villages were displaced. Visual evidence includes the removal of structures from villages that were forcibly relocated, and burn scars where destroyed villages used to be. During the past year, at least 167 more entire villages have been displaced.
Internal displacement in eastern Burma, however, is more commonly associated with the coerced movements of smaller groups rather than entire villages. This relates to impoverishment and forced migration caused by the confiscation of land, asset stripping, forced procurement policies, agricultural production quotas, forced labour, arbitrary taxation, extortion and restrictions on access to fields and markets. The compulsory and unavoidable nature of these factors is distinct from the voluntary profit-oriented, ""pull-factors"" more commonly associated with economic migration.
The total number of internally displaced persons who have been forced or obliged to leave their homes and have not been able to return or resettle and reintegrate into society is estimated to be at least half a million people. This displaced population includes 295,000 people currently in the temporary settlements of ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities. A further 99,000 civilians are estimated to be hiding from the SPDC in areas most affected by military skirmishes, while approximately 109,000 villagers have followed SPDC eviction orders and moved into designated relocation sites.
While the overall figures are comparable to last year, lower estimates for relocation sites primarily reflect villagers' attempts at returning to former villages or resettling nearby in Tenasserim Division and Shan State. However, it is not known how sustainable these movements will be, while SPDC campaigns to forcibly relocate and consolidate villages have intensified in northern Karen State, eastern Pegu Division and northern Mon state. Higher estimates for the internally displaced in ethnic ceasefire areas are largely attributed to the expansion of authority exercised by the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) and the newly formed KNU/KNLA Peace Council and subsequent instability in central Karen State. A slight population increase reported from hiding sites reflects the protracted emergency for the most vulnerable communities in eastern Burma
A feature of this report is the inclusion of trend assessments which have been derived from comparisons to findings from previous household surveys conducted by TBBC and partner agencies over the past few years. In terms of vulnerability, the prevalence of threats to personal safety and security has increased, and in particular the incidence of arbitrary arrest or detention and forced conscription to porter military supplies. Indicators suggest that restrictions on movement to fields and markets have almost doubled to become the most pervasive threat to livelihoods, ahead of forced labour and arbitrary taxation. Violence against women, and in particular the threat of domestic violence and physical assault, was perceived as most prevalent in relocation sites and mixed administration areas where Burmese Army troops are in close proximity...";;;The Border Consortium;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;19-10-2007;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/59285;http://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/internal-displacement-eastern-burma-2007-survey;;;;

OBL:74963;Where is genuine peace? - A critique of the peace process in Karenni State;;"A new report by the Karenni Civil Society Network (KCSN) raises concerns about
international “peace support” programming amid
st increasing Burma Army militarization in
Karenni State after the2012 ceasefire with the
Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP).
The report “Where is Genuine Peace?” exposes how a pilot resettlement project of the
Norway-led Myanmar Peace Support Initiative (MPSI) in Shardaw
Township is encouraging
IDPs to return to an area controlled by the Burma Army where their safety cannot be
guaranteed.
The MPSI claims that between June 2013 and
September 2014 it supported 1,431 IDPs to
return to 10 Shadaw villages forcibly relocated in 1996. However, KCSN found only about a
third of these IDPs in the villages, most of whom were working-age adults returning to carry
out farming, but not daring to return permanently due to fears of renewed conflict. As in
other parts of Karenni State, the Burma Army has been reinforcing troops and fortifying its
positions in Shadaw, where there is a tactical command centre and over 20 military
outposts.
“Instead of encouraging IDPs to return home be
fore it is safe, international donors should
be trying to ensure that the rights of conflict-affected villagers are protected,” said one of
KCSN. “There must be pressure on the government to pull back its troops from the ethnic
areas and start political dialog
ue towards federal reform.”
KCSN also criticizes the MPSI for fuelling conflict by ignoring Karenni-managed social service
organizations that have been providing primary health care and other support to IDPs in
Shadaw for decades. MPSI’s health support was through the government system, which
remains highly centralized and dysfunctional in Karenni State.
“Donors should not just give one-sided support to expand government services into ethnic
conflict areas. This won’t be effective, and will
only increase resentment and fuel conflict,”
said KSWDC.
The report also raises concerns about rampant
resource extraction after the ceasefire, land
confiscation, military expansions and lack of
transparency around dam plans on the Salween
and its tributaries in Karenni State. KCSN
is calling for a moratorium on large-scale
infrastructure and resource extraction projects
in Karenni State until there is genuine peace.""

OBL:72751;LESSONS FOR THE POTENTIAL USE OF CONTRACT FARMING WITH SMALL LAND HOLDING FARMERS IN MYANMAR;;"Introduction: ""The goal of poverty alleviation is now seen as a high priority project for 
Myanmar’s new 
government. 
In
public statements the new President, Thein Sein, has raised issues of 
poverty in 
Myanmar
as a problem 
facing
the country (as opposed to a previous failure to 
acknowledge any such problems.) 
Support for this goal 
was verbally
reiterated
in a
May 
2011
Poverty Alleviation Seminar headed by Dr. U Myint, and again, more broadly, at an 
August 2011 poverty alleviation seminar in Nyapidaw attended by President Thein Sein 
and democracy icon Daw Aung San Su Kyi. 
At both events speakers
presented papers 
aimed at monetary reform, assessments of 
Myanmar’s industrial sectors, infrastructure, 
and agricultural development. Presenters overwhelmingly acknowledged the agricultural 
sector as one in which improvements could be 
made 
to actually meet goals of addressing 
poverty.
With 70% of 
Myanmar’s population supported by agricultural related employment and 
incomes, policies 
to lower poverty levels
in this sector could 
significantly 
impact a 
majority of the country’s residents. Currently, of these 
residents, an estimated 
32.7% remain under the country’s poverty line, though critics have described this number as low
(CIA World Fact Book, 2011). 
Myanmar
is frequently 
referred
to as the one time “rice 
basket” of 
Asia, often highlighting how far the agricultural
and economic systems of 
Myanmar
have fallen. 
This renewed interest in the development of 
Myanmar’s 
agricultural sector has the potential to reengage that historical presence of agricultural 
vitality. 
Addressing 
the 
status of
low income and small
land holders will be a key part of this 
process
as farmers with 
less then 1 
and
up to 5
acres of 
land represent 
56% of Myanmar’s 
farming population
(FSWG, 2011). 
The economic security of small land hold farmers 
offer one way to sustainably improve the agricultural system and financial
lyempower a 
large population of Myanmar’s farmers. 
This paper will examine the possible use of contract farming
with 
small land holding
farmers 
as a tool 
to 
capitalize on the opportunity to improve the economic growth of 
Myanmar’s agricultural sector, as well as 
to sustainably 
improve 
the livelihood, capacity, 
and output 
of 
this demographic of
farmers. 
It is important to highlight that 
contract farming is not a blanket tool and 
the positive 
circumstances of successful cases
must be considered within Myanmar’s agricultural 
context. Critics of contract farming highlight the 
de-facto
inequality
farmers are
often
put 
in
by a contract, along with the significant 
risk
it can place on already fragile farming 2
environments
in 
which
farmers risk everything. Such risks could be exacerbated by 
Myanmar’s agricultural policy and political climate. 
Yet,
contract farming has been used
with increasing frequency to meet the needs of small land holding farmers, and 
companies that have specialist or niche farming needs. These contracts have led to a 
range of benefits for both farmers and contracting companies. 
The recent
agreement on 
the part of the new government to make agricultural development and poverty reduction 
policy goals, offers
a space
in 
which
contract farming
opportunities 
could support
the 
small land hold farming
sector of Myanmar’s agricultural community.
Based on this consideration, this paper will briefly explore the
theoretical views of 
contract
farming
currently used. 
It
will then examine the
circumstances of previous 
commercial or large contract farming attempts in 
Myanmar that have been problematic, before presenting two cases of contract farming with small land holders, in Laos and 
Cambodia. 
From the analysis of 
these 
two successful cases originally documented by the 
Asia Development Bank (ADB), this paper will work to identify positive and negative 
lessons learned in ea
ch circumstance. This
paper will
examine the opportunities for the 
application
of
these lessons to the context of Myanmar’s own small land hold farmers. 
It will then conclude with a brief examination of the larger 
policies
that would 
have 
impacted
contract farming implementation in 
Myanmar, compared to the 
policies
from 
Laos and Cambodia which 
have given rise to 
successful 
contract farming

small land hold farmers.";Thomas A.

OBL:73407;National Land Use Policy Consultation in Nay Pyi Taw: A positive step or a distraction?;;"Opinion and analysis on business and human rights issues in Myanmar...For the last two days I have been at the Workshop on the National Land Use Policy Formulation held at the Myanmar International Convention Centre in Nay Pyi Taw. Under discussion was the 6th, and likely final, draft of the National Land Use Policy. (Available here: http://www.fdmoecaf.gov.mm/documents)

While the government should be commended for holding open consultation and taking on board many of the comments from civil society, the consultation’s location in Nay Pyi Taw is prohibitive to most civil society organizations (CSOs). In fact, if it was not for the diligent organization of buses and accommodation by Land Core Group, headed by U Shwe Thein and facilitated by Glen Hunt, the consultation would have been more like a intergovernmental discussion.

The opening morning consisted of speeches by U Kyaw Kyaw Lwin, the Deputy Director General (Policy/Planning) of the Forest Department and U Aye Maung Sein a National Consultant, who reminded us of the draft’s content and outlined the process of consultation undertaken so far. Vice President U Nyan Htun, Chairman of National Land Resource Management Central Committee, also delivered a speech in which he explained how the government had ‘laid down a bottom up process for all sectors.’ But the really interesting discussion came during the small working groups. The participants signed up for the following 5 different working groups:...It certainly a step forward for Myanmar when the government engages in a long consultation process and amends numerous drafts to reflect many of civil society’s concerns. If nothing else, the NLUP will serve as an important guideline for Civil Society to use in its advocacy in Myanmar. It remains to be seen how the final draft will look and how its provisions will frame the drafting of much needed, consolidated land law.

OBL:72404;Policies for Shared Prosperity in Myanmar (English, Burmese ??????????);;"INTRODUCTION: ""The November 8, 2015 elections in Myanmar
marked a historic milestone in the country’s political
and economic transition that began in 2011.
Incoming policy makers are preparing to pick up the
baton and deliver on the people’s strong aspirations for
a harmonious and prosperous Myanmar. In this series
of policy notes, the World Bank Group seeks to promote
dialogue on critical development challenges and
on options for policies and reforms that can contribute
to shared prosperity for the people of Myanmar.
Myanmar has strong medium-term growth potential.
Efforts to open up and liberalize the economy over the
past 4 years have revealed pent up demand, brought
in new investments, and increased productivity from
a very low base. Between 2011 and 2014 Myanmar’s
economy grew at an average real rate of 7 percent per
year, which is among the fastest in East Asia, and comparable
to other high performing countries in their initial
phase of liberalization. In the coming years, further
removal of economic controls could help Myanmar to
maintain a strong pace of growth.
Myanmar has a real opportunity in ensuring
that growth is also inclusive. This not only means
sustaining a strong pace of growth, but doing so
through a diversified economy that can absorb the
labor force into higher productivity sectors. The
agriculture sector, which suffers from low productivity,
contributing on average only 10-15 percent to annual
real GDP growth over the past 4 years, employs over
half of the country’s labor force. The manufacturing and
construction sectors on the other hand, which have
the highest value added per unit of labor, employ only
10-15 percent of the labor force.
Policies that can enable a structural shift to more
productive and labor intensive activities could make
a big dent on poverty and inequality in Myanmar.
These would include expanding access to essential
public services. This could enable a bigger share of
the population to benefit from the agglomeration of
economic activities around Myanmar’s growth poles,
namely Yangon and Mandalay, which account for
roughly 35 percent of national GDP.
The sound governance and use of Myanmar’s natural
resource wealth are also critical to inclusive
growth. Around 10 percent of Myanmar’s official GDP
is derived from natural resources, though some estimate
unofficial trade in natural resources at more than
20 percent of official GDP. This not only concentrates
wealth from non-renewable national assets in the hands
of a few, but also finances conflicts, which have created
vicious cycles of poverty that are geographically and
ethnically concentrated.
Policy reforms since 2011 have started to promote
inclusion so that a growing share of Myanmar’s
people can take advantage of new opportunities
and benefit from economic growth. Higher tax collections
from non-agriculture sectors and rising natural
resource rents have enabled Myanmar to reprioritize
public spending towards critical economic and social
service needs. Foreign exchange, trade and investment
liberalization have opened up economic opportunities
and the space for investment beyond a small group of
highly protected sectors. Increased public sector transparency
and decentralization have started to gradually
bring the state closer to the people.
Given this context, how can Myanmar advance
reforms to close the disparities across its geography,
ethnic communities, and income groups; and to
promote productivity and competitiveness? This is
the question that this series of policy notes, “All aboard!
Policies for shared prosperity in Myanmar,” aims to
generate debate and ideas. The theme “All aboard” is
meant to reflect inclusivity and imminent departure on
a positive journey.
The policy notes focus on six interconnected areas
that are likely to be high priorities for shared prosperity
(figure 1). The first is on closing the gap in access
to social services for improving Myanmar’s human
development outcomes. This could help to strengthen
the productivity and employability of Myanmar’s current
and future labor force, which is the critical input to
inclusive growth and a precondition to success in all
the other areas. The second policy note is on growing
together by reducing poverty in rural areas. Policies
to boost agriculture productivity and accelerate the
delivery of essential services in rural areas, where they
lag the most, could help to supply the much needed
labor and food for the rapidly expanding industrial,
manufacturing and service sectors.
Investment in higher productivity sectors is also likely
to require breaking business as usual to foster competitiveness
and a dynamic environment for private
sector growth across the country, which are discussed
in the third policy note. These include policies that are
targeted at reducing the costs of doing business and
engaging in international trade. The relative impact
of these could be enormous in terms of incentivizing
private sector investments, expanding access to economic
opportunities for rural and urban populations,
and diversifying the sources of growth.
Enabling these to drive major structural transformations
in the economy is likely to require policy reforms in two
important areas. The fourth policy note therefore looks
at options to expand Myanmar’s ability for financing the
future through an open, modern, and inclusive financial
system. This is important not only for channeling savings
to large private investments, but also to finance public
sector operations and service delivery, facilitate the
expansion of international trade, and enable the transfer
of increased remittances to rural areas. The fifth policy
note is on energizing Myanmar by enhancing access to
sustainable energy for all. Myanmar’s growing economy
will need more energy than is currently supplied – not
only for productive sectors, but also for the delivery of
public services across the country.";Habib Rab + team;;World Bank Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;23-02-2016;"en;my";"natural resources management;land use";;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/72404;http://burmalibrary.org/docs21/World_Bank-2016-02-23-All_aboard-en.pdf;;;;
OBL:77103;Myanmar REDD+ Readiness Roadmap;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Having signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 11 June 1992
and ratified the convention on 25 November 1994 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2003 as a non?Annex 1
party, Myanmar is fully aware of the causes and potential impacts of climate change. Hence, whilst
undertaking political reform and aiming at rapid economic development, Myanmar is striving to reduce
its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The government of Myanmar has recognised the potential of the
REDD+ initiative to contribute to green development by protecting global environmental resources
(forest carbon stocks, but also biodiversity), helping to reverse land degradation, helping to improve the
livelihoods of the rural poor and aiding adaptation to climate change.
Although still largely a poor country, Myanmar is rapidly opening up to Foreign Direct Investments (FDI)
in the energy, mining and agricultural sector. Unless astutely managed, economic growth may have
negative impacts on the environment and the natural resource base. In addition, climate change
threatens to reverse socio?economic advances. Recognizing these inter?related challenges, the
Government increasingly views the forestry sector as a key component and driver of sustainable and

OBL:61084;The politics of the emerging agro-industrial complex in Asia’s ‘final frontier’ - The war on food sovereignty in Burma;;"Burma's dramatic turn-around from 'axis of evil' to western darling in the past year has been imagined as Asia's 'final frontier' for global finance institutions, markets and capital. Burma's agrarian landscape is home to three-fourths of the country's total population which is now being constructed as a potential prime investment sink for domestic and international agribusiness. The Global North's development aid industry and IFIs operating in Burma has consequently repositioned itself to proactively shape a pro-business legal environment to decrease political and economic risks to enable global finance capital to more securely enter Burma's markets, especially in agribusiness. But global capitalisms are made in localized places - places that make and are made from embedded social relations. This paper uncovers how regional political histories that are defined by very particular racial and geographical undertones give shape to Burma's emerging agro-industrial complex. The country's still smoldering ethnic civil war and fragile untested liberal democracy is additionally being overlain with an emerging war on food sovereignty. A discursive and material struggle over land is taking shape to convert subsistence agricultural landscapes and localized food production into modern, mechanized industrial agro-food regimes. This second agrarian transformation is being fought over between a growing alliance among the western development aid and IFI industries, global finance capital, and a solidifying Burmese military-private capitalist class against smallholder farmers who work and live on the country's now most valuable asset - land. Grassroots resistances increasingly confront the elite capitalist class' attempts to corporatize food production through the state's rule of law and police force. Farmers, meanwhile, are actively developing their own shared vision of food sovereignty and pro-poor land reform that desires greater attention....

the collective rights of indigenous peoples, particularly the thematic areas of land, 
territories, and natural resources, development, and language and cultural rights, with 
militarization, self-determination, and free, prior
 and informed consent (FPIC) as cross-cutting issues. •Section A describes the context of indigenous peoples in Myanmar/Burma. It highlights the 
lack of understanding about the internationally-recognised concept of indigenous peoples, 
and lack of accurate information about the number of indigenous peoples in 
Myanmar/Burma. •Section B outlines the normative and institutional 
framework of the State under Review 
(SuR) as it pertains to indigenous peoples. It focuses on the policy and legislative 
framework relating to land use, national bodies with a mandate to address the key issue of 
land grabbing, and the current peace process in Myanmar/Burma. 
•Section C draws on human rights documentation collected by member organizations of this 
coalition, and highlights how control over land and
 natural resources for development 
projects in indigenous peoples’ territories is driving violent conflict and related human 
rights violations. It addresses issues of widespread land confiscation, negative 
environmental, social, and health impacts, and threats to traditional and sustainable 
livelihoods from development projects. It also details how militarization, displacement, and 
oppression have violated language and cultural rights.

OBL:72053;Following the Money: An Advocate's Guide to Securing Accountability in Agricultural Investments;;"... Large-scale agricultural investments – in plantations, processing plants or contract farming schemes, for example – have increased in recent years, particularly in developing countries. Investment in the agriculture sector can bring much needed support for rural development, but communities have also witnessed significant negative impacts. Some of the most serious involve local landholders being displaced from their lands and losing access to
natural resources critical for their livelihoods and wellbeing. Instead of contributing to rural development, ill-conceived investments can undermine people’s rights to food, to water or to decent work.

Improving accountability is essential in ensuring that investment processes respond to local needs and aspirations and respect human rights. Yet many deals struck between
companies and governments to establish agricultural ventures are not fully transparent, making it difficult for the public and local communities to scrutinise projects before they materialise on the ground. Despite international human rights law and best practice
requiring full transparency, public participation, and free prior and informed consent of local communities, civil society participation is often missing and once negative impacts have occurred citizens may struggle to have their voices heard or hold the company or the government to account. Weak governance is often accompanied by limited accountability to citizens.

Yet, despite these challenges, many citizens have been able to hold companies and governments to account. For this to happen, local communities and the organisations that
support them have to get organised, get informed and be strategic.

Supporting affected communities to get organised so that they can collectively challenge or influence the project is essential to any successful advocacy. Success can take a long time – sometimes involving years of struggle – so ensuring strong community solidarity is key. Communities should be aware of their rights and what laws, regulations and policies are in place to protect them. An organised and informed community can then begin to devise a sophisticated advocacy strategy to achieve their goals.

Usually the first step is to take complaints directly to local authorities, national authorities or the business operating on the ground. But when these approaches have limited success, communities and their supporters should not give up. There are other strategies that can be tried which reach beyond the borders of the project and the country where it is located.

Behind most large-scale agricultural projects is a web of global actors that make the project possible. These actors include banks and companies that are funding the project and the companies that are buying the produce being grown or processed by it. All of these actors are necessary to the project’s success, and all are aiming to earn a
profit from it in one way or another. They all have a relationship with the business operating on the ground and have the ability to influence it. All of these actors have some responsibility to ensure that the project does not harm communities.

Knowing who is financing the project, who is buying the produce and who else is making the project possible and profitable – in other words, ‘following the money’ – opens up a range of opportunities for improved accountability. We call the web of actors involved in a project an ‘investment chain’. Within this chain there are ‘pressure points’. If affected communities can identify the strongest pressure points and take actions directed at effectively influencing key actors in the investment chain, they are more likely to achieve their goals.

Understanding investment chains and pressure points, and effectively making use of them, can prove difficult. This Guide provides information, practical tips and exercises on how to map an investment chain behind a project, identify the strongest pressure points along the chain and then devise effective advocacy strategies that leverage those points. It explains what you need to know, the challenges you may face and the strengths and weaknesses of a range of advocacy options. Examples are provided from cases around the world where communities have tried to ‘follow the money’ and have used a number of strategies to hold investors and governments to account...";"Emma Blackmore

OBL:72052;The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystem Services in Myanmar and Options for Sustainable Financing;;"... This document reports on a study carried out to assess the value of the forest sector to Myanmar's economy, in order to justify and identify niches for developing forest-based payments for ecosystem services (PES) and other mechanisms that can be used to generate financing for forest conservation.

The study focuses on nine categories of forest ecosystem services that are of high importance in economic and human wellbeing terms, and for which sufficient data are available to enable monetary valuation: wood-based biomass and energy, wild foods, animal-based energy, watershed protection, coastal protection, carbon sequestration, maintenance of nursery populations and habitats, pollination and seed dispersal, and nature-based recreation and tourism.

The study first assesses the baseline: it identifies the ecosystem services that are currently being generated by the forest sector, and estimates their economic value. It then models two possible policy and management futures: “Forest Degradation”, under which forest lands and resources continue to be degraded and over-exploited; and “Forest Conservation”, under which forests are used sustainably and conserved effectively according to the goals and targets laid out in the Forestry Masterplan...";"Lucy Emerton

OBL:75811;PRO-BUSINESS OR PRO-POOR? - MAKING SENSE OF THE RECENTLY UNVEILED DRAFT NATIONAL LAND USE POLICY;;"A joint preliminary assessment by
TNI Myanmar Project and TNI Agrarian Justice Programme.....Summary:
""October 18, 2014 saw the official unveiling by the government of
the Republic of the Union of Myanmar

of its much-awaited draft
national land use policy. Once it is finalized, the new policy will
guide the establishment of a new overarching framework for the
governance of tenure of land and related natural resources like
forests for years to come. As such, it is of vital importance. This
preliminary assessment aims to shed light on the key aspects of the
draft policy and its potential implications for the country’s majority
rural working poor, especially its ethnic minority peoples, although
they are not the only ones whose future prospects hinge on how this
policy making process will unfold. The scope of the policy is
national
and clearly intends to determine for years to come how land will
be used – especially by whom and for what purposes – in lowland
rural and urban areas as well. Focused critical engagement by civil
society groups will likely be needed to ensure that the policy process
addresses the concerns and aspirations of all rural working people
system wide. Initial scrutiny suggests that those who see the land
problem today as a problem of business and investment – e.g., how
to establish a more secure environment particularly for foreign
direct investments – are likely to be pleased with the draft policy.
Those who think that the land problem goes deeper – e.g., implicating
the social-ecological foundations of the country’s unfolding politi
-
cal-economic transition – are likely to be seriously concerned. This
suggests that focused efforts at trying to influence the content and
character of the draft policy are needed. The government’s decision
to open the policy process to public participation is therefore a
welcome one. Yet whether and to what extent this public consultation
process will be truly free and meaningful remains to be seen";;;Transnational Institute;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;23-10-2014;en;"land policies;land administration;land governance;land law";;Land Policy & Legislation;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75811;http://www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/myanmar_land_policy-1.pdf;;;;

Sand has become a vital commodity for our modern economies: we use it in our toothpaste, detergents, and cosmetics, and computers and mobile phones couldn’t exist without it. Our houses, skyscrapers, bridges and airports are all basically made with sand: it has become the most widely consumed natural resource on the planet after fresh water. The worldwide construction boom fuelled by emerging economies and increasing urbanization has led to intensive sand extraction on land and in the oceans, with damaging environmental impacts. Sand Wars takes us around the world as it tracks the contractors, sand smugglers and unscrupulous property developers involved in the new gold rush, and meets the environmentalists and local populations struggling to reverse the threat to the future of this resource that we all take for granted.";Denis Delestrac;;Vimeo;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2012;en;"mining;land investments;extractive industries";Land & Investments;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/101107;http://sand-wars.com/;;;;
OBL:101104;Sand mining: The High Volume – Low Value Paradox;;"Water does not exist in isolation. It is an integral part of any ecosystem and as such, every major change to this ecosystem has hydrological impacts which then lead to sociological, economic and other environmental consequences. The world’s freshwater resources are under threat from a wide variety of factors. Many of them such as over-abstraction of water from rivers and aquifers, pollution from point and non-point sources, changing patterns of precipitation are popularly known, debated and discussed widely. However, there are other crucial factors with significant social, environmental and economic impacts that are less known. One such threat is an activity known as ‘sand mining’ also referred to as dredging or gravel mining. and mining has several negative impacts.

It poses a threat to water security in several ways. Dredging results in lowering of the alluvial water table which, in turn, directly affects groundwater storage capacity (See Kondolf et al., 2001). Excessive dredging allows for saline intrusion into groundwater (Viswanathan, 2002). The lowered water table implies a rise in water costs, thus restricting access to only those who can afford it (Hoering, 2008). It results in habitat loss including destruction and fragmentation of fragile, endangered ecosystems and reduced species richness (See Myers, 1999, Global Witness, 2010).Sand mining also causes increased shoreline erosion rates, especially when mined unscientifically (Byrnes et al., 2000) and decreases protection from sea water especially during ocean disasters (Myers, 1999). It also poses a threat to critical infrastructure such as bridges, roads, railway tracks (Kondolf et al., 2001). Sand mining has also been known to cause loss of livelihoods in several instances (See Hoering, 2008, Young and Griffith, 2009 and Viswanathan, 2002). Other macroeconomic impacts have also been observed such as changes in land use patterns (Myers 1999) and increased public health costs (Myers & Muhajir I997, Mensah, 1997).

The demand for sand is fuelled by numerous factors. It appears that sand has long been commoditized and is now entrenched in global trade.

VIII Conclusions.


""...Thai-Burmese relations have reached a critical juncture. Never before have Thai policy-makers
expressed such frustration over bilateral ties, especially over the issue of narcotics suppression.
Before the extensive political reform in Thailand in 1997, Thai-Burmese ties were mainly driven by
personal friendship. For instance, the leaders of the armed forces from the two countries met often and
resolved conflicts on an ad hoc basis and through gentlemen’s agreements. That helped explain why
certain problems could be settled quickly and other problems dragged on. It must be noted that some
of the issues settled through political expediency have returned to haunt the leaders of the two
countries. In the past, strong military ties omitted and obliterated other key policy-makers including
the Foreign Ministry, the National Security Council, the Interior Ministry and other related
organizations. But with reform, the Foreign Ministry took the lead in the formation and execution of
Burma policy.
The international community would like to see Thailand take a firm stand against the Burmese junta.
As in the Cambodian conflict between 1978 and 1992, Thailand was able to provide leadership during
the 14-year conflict and was a prime mover behind ASEAN solidarity and policy initiatives.
Unfortunately, during the crucial days of Burma–ASEAN relations between 1995 and 1997, when key
ASEAN decisions were made, Thailand was troubled by political uncertainty at home. However, the
political reform that has taken place since 1997 should serve as political bedrock.
However, when the government under Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra came to power in early
2001, he turned the Burmese policy upside down. With strong support from his coalition partner,
Defense Minister Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, he has followed a policy of appeasement to further
economic ties and, in particular, gain cooperation in narcotics suppression.
The long-term prospects of joint anti-narcotic suppression and proposed demarcation of the border
remain doubtful. With an absolute majority in the house, the Thaksin government is likely to continue
the current policy which stimulates cross border trade regardless of political conditions inside the
country...";Kavi Chongkittavorn;;International IDEA;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;14-12-2001;en;;;;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/46622;http://burmalibrary.org/docs3/challenges_to_democratization_in_burma-Chapter5.pdf;;;;

OBL:61978;State terror in the Kachin hills - Burma Army attacks against civilians in Northern Burma;;"Summary:
""In late 2012, the Burma Army intensified military operations against strongholds of the
Kachin Independence Army (KIA). This culminated in a massive offensive on the KIA
headquarters at Laiza on the China-Burma border starting in mid-December. This month-long
assault involved repeated mortar shelling and aerial bombings in the Laiza area, populated by
20,000 civilians, over half of whom are internally displaced persons (IDPs) who were denied
refuge in China.
This report documents the killing or injury of 26 civilians, including women, children and the
elderly, in Burmese artillery attacks in five areas during the recent military operations. The
repeated authorization of artillery fire into areas populated by civilians, as well as deliberate
torching of villages and IDP shelters, represent serious breaches of international humanitarian
law, and are likely to amount to war crimes.
The humanitarian situation in Kachin areas remains critical, with 364 villages wholly or
partially abandoned, and over 100,000 people internally displaced. Hardly any international
aid has been provided to the 66,000 IDPs in Kachin-controlled areas.
There has been little international condemnation of the Burma Army aggression in Kachin
State. Foreign governments appear more interested in pursuing diplomatic and economic
engagement with Burma’s military-backed government. However, silence on the Burmese
military’s crimes risks plunging Burma deeper into civil war, by emboldening Burma’s rulers
to continue using force to crush the ethnic resistance movements. .
The international community must strongly condemn the crimes committed by the Burma
Army, and pressure the Burmese government to end all military aggression, begin troop
withdrawal from Kachin areas of Burma, and enter into political dialogue with the Kachin
Independence Army to address the demands for ethnic equality at the root of the conflict.";;;Kachin Women’s Association Thailand (KWAT);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;28-02-2013;en;"land conflicts;displacement";Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61978;http://burmalibrary.org/docs15/State_terror_in_the_kachin_hills.pdf;;;;
OBL:61979;BURMA: Two sharply contrasting reports on the struggle for land at Letpadaung;;"The Asian Human Rights Commission has since mid-2012 closely followed, documented and reported on the struggle of farmers in the Letpadaung Hills of central Burma against the expansion of a copper mining operation under a military-owned holding company and a partner company from China. After repeatedly being refused permission to demonstrate against the operation under the terms of the country's new antidemocratic public demonstration law, the farmers began public protests, which were met with a range of repressive measures, culminating in the night time attack on encamped protestors last November. The attack received international media coverage because the police fired white phosphorous into the protest camps causing extensive burns to protestors, the majority of them monks who had joined villagers in resistance to the mine project.

In recent months two reports have been issued, in Burmese, on the struggle against the mine. The reports make interesting reading because they represent very different perspectives and understandings of the issues for the affected villagers in Letpadaung. One is the official report of an investigative commission headed by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, published in the 12 March 2013 edition of the state newspaper. The other is an unofficial report by the 88 Students Generation group and the Lawyers Network, Upper Burma, issued before the official report, on 21 January 2013. Whereas the latter report represents a genuine effort to identify the causes for the opposition to the mine and speak to the human rights questions concerned with events in Letpadaung of 2012, the former is little more than an exercise in playing at politics, and an attempt to sidestep and obfuscate the questions of human rights involved through the use of ""information"" that conceals more than it reveals...";;;Asian Human Rights Commission;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;03-04-2013;en;"mining;extractive industries;expropriation;land use;land grabbing";;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/61979;http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-STM-073-2013;;;;

OBL:60285;GA 2006 (61st Session): Report by the Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (English);;"Summary:
""...
In the past two years, the reform process proposed in the “seven-point road map
for national reconciliation and democratic transition”, which was meant to become
eventually open to various relevant actors, has been strictly limited and delineated.
As a result, the political space has been redefined in narrower terms. In addition,
obstructions in the past couple of years have held back the pace and inclusive nature
of the reforms which were required for democratization. The work of the National
Convention has been adversely affected by this evolution.
Through the decades, the space for the establishment of civilian and democratic
institutions has been seriously curtailed. The capacity of law enforcement institutions
and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary have been hampered by
sustained practices of impunity. This situation has contributed to reinforce inequality
and increased the gap between the poorest and the richest.
On 27 May 2006, the house arrest of Aung Sang Suu Kyi was further prolonged
by 12 months in spite of various international appeals, including by the Secretary-
General of the United Nations. As at the end of August 2006, the number of political
prisoners was estimated at 1,185. From April to July 2006, 1,038 members of the
National League for Democracy were reportedly forced to resign from the party
following intimidation and threats. The Special Rapporteur has consistently indicated
that national reconciliation requires meaningful and inclusive dialogue with and
between political representatives. He firmly believes that the national reconciliation
and the stability of Myanmar are not well served by the arrest and detention of
several political leaders or by the severe and sustained restrictions on fundamental
freedoms.
The persecution of members of political parties in the opposition and human
rights defenders shows that nowadays the road map for democracy faces too many
obstacles to bring a genuine transition. In the past, the Special Rapporteur
acknowledged that the road map could play a positive role in the political transition.
Sadly, the positive momentum in the early years of his mandate is apparently stalled.
The Special Rapporteur remains particularly concerned about the continuing
impunity, which has become systematic and must be urgently addressed by the
Government of Myanmar. It has become increasingly clear that the persistent
A/61/369
06-53070 3
impunity does not only stem from a lack of institutional capacity. Impunity has
allowed accountability to be avoided for acts that have oppressed voices questioning
existing policies and practices. Several individuals and groups responsible for
committing serious violations of human rights, in particular members of the military,
have not been prosecuted. There is also little evidence that these serious crimes have
been investigated by relevant authorities.
Grave human rights violations are received among the established structures of
the State Peace and Development Council and indulged not only with impunity but
authorized by the sanction of laws. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur is also
very concerned by the continued misuse of the legal system, which denies the rule of
law and represents a major obstacle for securing the effective and meaningful
exercise of fundamental freedoms by citizens. He considers especially as a matter of
grave concern the criminalization of the exercise of fundamental freedoms by
political opponents, human rights defenders and victims of human rights abuses.
The Special Rapporteur is very concerned by the ongoing military campaign in
ethnic areas of eastern Myanmar and by its effects on human rights, especially on
civilians who have been targeted during the attacks. The situation should be
considered in connection with the widespread practice of land confiscation
throughout the country, seemingly aiming to anchor military control, especially in
ethnic areas. Such a practice has led to numerous forced evictions, relocations and
resettlements, situations of forced migration and internal displacement. Given the
scale of the current military campaign, the situation may lead to a humanitarian crisis
if it is not addressed immediately.
The Special Rapporteur takes note of the recent vote of the Security Council on
15 September 2006 to include Myanmar in its agenda. He believes that a
forthcoming debate of the Council on Myanmar may offer an opportunity to speed up
the process of transition towards democracy.""....N.B. CORR.

OBL:64098;Community Forestry in Myanmar: Some field realities;;"INTRODUCTION:
""Myanmar’s Community Forestry programme began in with the Community Forestry Instruction of 1995. Since then over two hundred and fifty Forest User Groups have been formed across the country, and have taken responsibility for controlling, managing and sustainably using a wide range of forest. How have they faired?
In an effort to answer that question this paper presents the experiences from 16 randomly selected Forest User Groups across the country. They were visited by a research team in late 2010 during a Community Forestry study conducted by ECCDI, with technical support from the School of International Development, University of East Anglia, under funding support from the Pyoe Pin programme. Full findings from the study are presented in a separate report (Tint et al. 2011 ‘Community Forestry in Myanmar: Progress and Potentials’). This companion paper presents the local realities of community forestry experiences on a case by case basis.
The diverse range of stories here show that Forest User groups are struggling against a wide range of challenges, with very limited support in most cases, and only some are able to overcome them effectively. Regional conditions are a key factor, with the dry zone and Shan FUGs struggling much more than the more supportive environmental conditions in Kachin and the Delta...";"Oliver Springate-Baginski

OBL:46023;"""I Will Not be Forced From My Own Land"" - internal displacement in Burma";;In a nation of 50 million people there are estimates that up to 1 million are Internally Displaced Persons (IDP). Despite the relatively recent use of the phrase internally displaced people in the context of Burma, there is evidence that the practices that lead to this displacement have been in place for a long period of time. While discussion of IDP’s tends to revolve around immediate assistance to concerns of health, housing and food, the sustained existence of this problem needs future efforts to take into account the root cause and structural patterns that often instigate the displacement as well as resolutions on how to offer and implement humanitarian assistance. This article will discuss further some of the root causes of displacement caused by Burmese military operations and look at the outcomes of displacement. The second part of this article will look at future resolutions and how long-term structural assistance needs to compliment immediate humanitarian assistance...;R Sharples;;"Burma Issues;Peace Way Foundation";Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2003;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/46023;http://www.burmaissues.org/En/Newsletter/BINews2003-11.php#IDP;;;;

Villagers continue to face movement restrictions, specifically a curfew which prevents villagers from leaving T--- after 6:00 pm, as well as demands from people's militia and Tatmadaw troops for food on a bi-monthly basis following troop rotations, and monthly demands for a big tin (16 kg. / 35.2 lb.) of rice. Payments are also reported in lieu of sentry duties for the Tatmadaw. An incident involving the disappearance and suspected killing of a previous village head in the past was also mentioned. Relocation is reported to have severely undermined villagers’ food security; food scarcity in the relocation village has been exacerbated by the area being more highly populated, with less agricultural land available for villagers to cultivate or on which to graze cattle, and as a consequence they are forced to purchase the bulk of their food in order to survive.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;18-05-2012;en;"land conflicts;local community;food security;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/63827;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2012/khrg12b42.pdf;;;;

OBL:60591;Without Respite: Renewed Attacks on Villages and Internal Displacement in Toungoo District;;"With the annual monsoon rains now falling over Karen State, the SPDC’s military offensive
against civilian villagers in northern Karen State would normally be drawing to a close.
However, quite the opposite is happening. The resumption of SPDC Army attacks on
villages and the increased patrols in Toungoo District shows that the offensive is far from
over. Thousands more landmines have been reportedly deployed across Toungoo District to
isolate certain parts of the district and restrict villagers’ movements. An analysis of SPDC
Army troop movements and tactics suggests that the offensive is now set to expand
eastward across the Day Loh River where it can be expected that SPDC units will soon
commence shelling and destroying villages. In addition to this, the situation in the southeast
of the district has become dire as the villagers are now caught between two advancing
columns and have nowhere left to flee. It is likely that dozens more villages will be
destroyed and thousands more villagers will be displaced in the coming months.

Civilian villagers living in Toungoo District (Taw Oo in Karen), the northernmost of the seven
Karen districts in eastern Burma, have been under attack since November last year. In its
latest military offensive against the civilian population, the State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC) military junta has been targeting Karen villagers living in the hills of northern
Karen State in the ongoing attempt to consolidate its control and bring the whole of the
population under its rule. Over the past six months, thousands of villagers have been
displaced and dozens of villages have been abandoned and/or destroyed. The wet season
has now commenced, but the attacks show no sign of slowing down. Unlike in previous
years, when offensive activities would cease with the onset of the rains, the SPDC has
actually recently intensified its activities against Karen civilians in Toungoo District. The
situation for the villagers is now growing increasingly desperate as more and more troops
flood into the district to inflict wholesale human rights violations...""... Table of Contents:

OBL:60599;Burma: Displaced Karens. Like Water on the Khu Leaf;;"War disrupts the normal relationship between people and place.
Displaced by war, people must adapt to survive, both physically and
socially. When people are displaced for a long time, these
adaptations become normal; thus displacement starts as an
aberration but becomes a constant way of life. In eastern Burma,
'normal' displacement has led to significant changes in the political,
cultural and economic relationships between Karen people and their
'place' - both the physical space they occupy and their position in
society. Those changes, and particularly the Karens' own revised
perceptions of their place in the world, provide insights into how
they, and others in Burma, cope with displacement.
In Burma,1 population displacement is widespread, though little
understood. Armed conflict, disputes over land and natural
resources, and poverty drive people from their homes; but there has
been little research on displacement's effect on people's lives.2 Many
internally displaced persons live in remote areas that are also theatres
of war; and the government of Burma denies permission to
researchers or aid workers hoping to visit these contested regions.
Furthermore, until a few years ago, Burma's displaced population
attracted little international attention. Few, apart from a handful of
Thailand-based aid organisations, knew about conditions in the war
zones. By the late 1990s, however, the world became more aware of
conditions inside Burma, thanks to reports of displacement,
increasing numbers of would-be refugees seeking asylum in
Thailand, the controversial repatriation of Burmese refugees from
Bangladesh, deteriorating tolerance for refugees in Thailand, and the
burgeoning influence of Burma's democracy movement...";Chris Cusano;;Norwegian Refugee Council;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-2000;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/60599;http://burmalibrary.org/docs3/Cusano-Displaced_Karen.pdf;;;;

OBL:71640;Analysis of Customary Communal Tenure of Upland Ethnic Groups, Myanmar;;"Customary Tenure and Land Alienation in Myanmar:
""Customary communal tenure is characteristic of many local upland communities in S.E. Asia. These
communities have strong ancestral relationships to their land, which has never been held under
individual rights, but considered common property of the village. Communal tenure has been the
norm and land has never been a commodity. This is an age-old characteristic of many societies
globally. Prior to the publication in 1861 of Ancient Law by the English jurist Henry Sumner Maine,
the accepted view among Western jurists in the nineteenth century had been that the origin of the
concept of property was the occupation of land by a single proprietor and his family. However,
Maine insisted that for India, for example, “it is more than likely that joint ownership, and not
separate ownership, is the really archaic institution, and that the forms of property that will afford
us instruction will be those that are associated with the rights of families and of groups of kindred.”1
The international recognition of this had earlier emerged in developed countries such as Australia,
New Zealand and Canada and it became manifest in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples in 2007. The Declaration specifies individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples, as
well as their rights to culture, identity, language, land and natural resources, employment, health,
education and other issues. It was voted for in the UN by 144 countries, including Myanmar.
In Myanmar customary tenure arrangements date back centuries. They are linked to the
characteristics of the landscape and its resources, to the kinship systems, to population density and
to the actual history of the area and settlement. In general the ethnic upland villagers’ identity is
clearly linked to the land constituting a dense network of particular places, each having different
cultural and material value and containing a mosaic of resources. There is an inner connection
between history, identity and land...";"Kirsten Ewers Andersen (Member of the Land Core Group

Environmental Conservation and the General Administration Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs,
and the Yangon City Development Committee. It is intended to assess and inform the land related
discourse in Myanmar on the status of governance and administration of land with strategic options and
recommendations on the way forward. The policy notes aim to promote consensus over priorities under
the following five key themes of the land sector: (i) Land Policy and Regulatory Framework; (ii) Forestland
Administration and Management; (iii) Land Administration; (iv) Geospatial Infrastructure and Services;
and (v) Property Valuation and Taxation....Key elements for effective policy and regulatory framework on land that should be developed are:
*Developing an effective land governance system should
begin by using of the current legal framework to implement
new land policies such as: (i) protections for customary users’
tenure rights; (ii) the promotion of diverse agricultural
practices such as livestock breeding and aquaculture; (iii)
directing land allocation policies to improve land access for
marginal farmers and landless households; (iv) and
establishing programs such as a model land office to guide
the development of a national land administration system
that covers all areas (rural, urban, forest) and all tenure types
(individual, group, communal).
* The establishment of a union-level body or council to carry
out the National Land Use Policy and allow land sector
coordination between land related line ministries.
* The amendment of current land laws to expand the roles of
farmers and community members in land use decision
* The promotion of the revised community forest instruction,
which broadly reinterpreted the forest law to remove
restrictions on shifting cultivation to protect customary land

September, 2017 in Yangon and in Nay Pyi Taw, and the policy notes will be finalized by the end of 2017.

Well the whole phenomenon needs to be looked at in terms of the history of the country when it comes to land ever since independence, whereby a system of law, which essentially gave all power to the state when it came to the control, use and allocation of land, was used and very often abused by those who were members of the state or closely associated with the state to acquire land for personal benefit.

That process may take a slightly different form today and may manifest itself in slightly different ways than it did in the past, but the environment now – with greater openness and greater commercial possibilities, business possibilities and investment possibilities – has put ever greater and increasing pressure on land with the net result being that values go up, expectations go up, and therefore the incentives to acquire land and benefit from it personally have also consequentially expanded.

OBL:75037;Global Witness submission on Myanmar’s draft national land policy (English);;"Summary:
""As part of its transition to democratic reform, in October 2014, the Government of Myanmar released a draft national land policy and plans for a subsequent Land Law, for public consultation. The importance of this cannot be understated and Global Witness welcomes both the potential for a strong codified framework for land, and the opportunity for public participation. It is crucial, however, that consultation is meaningful and genuinely participatory, and the resulting feedback is incorporated into the policy and Land Law in a process that is fully transparent. What’s more, the final land policy and subsequent land law should be robust and in line with international standards, most notably, the UN Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests1.
The guiding principles of the draft national land policy state that its objectives are to ‘benefit and harmonize the land use, development and environmental conservation of the land resources of the State, to protect the land use right of the citizens and to improve land administration system.’ This aim is extremely welcome as an essential step in achieving the urgently needed reforms in the country’s land governance. However what is notably absent from the policy is a clear roadmap of priorities to be addressed: genuine sustainable development should prioritise the land and user rights, livelihoods and food security of its population, followed by participatory land-use mapping to help guide decisions around the management and use of land. Only then should an assessment be made of what is required in terms of land investments and what, if any, areas of land should be allocated for commercial investment purposes. In its current form, however, the draft land policy makes no reference to poverty alleviation or food security, and instead appears to be openly promoting commercial investment in large-scale projects, potentially at the expense of Myanmar’s rural smallholders – the majority of the population.
The draft land policy has come under criticism for being pro-business; however, industry should still remain cautious about the reforms being proposed. In its current form, the draft policy presents an uncertain legal landscape which requires much clarification, particularly on several contradictory articles on how land and user rights will be protected. Insecure land and user rights can present a financial risk to both governments and companies as demonstrated through recent research at the global level: both The Munden Project2 - a global think-tank working on finance and sustainability - and the international coalition group Rights and Resources Initiative have demonstrated the financial risk to both governments and businesses associated with land investments in countries where tenure rights are unclear through a number of global case studies.
It is therefore recommended that the Government of Myanmar, with the assistance of its development partners, revise the current draft of the land policy to ensure it has clear aims and objectives, and is based on international standards in particular, the UN Voluntary Guidelines of the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security.";;;Global Witness;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2014;en;"land policies;property rights;land use planning;land governance;land administration;land rights;land law;land tenure systems";;"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Policy Papers & Briefs;http://burmalibrary.org/node/75037;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/Global_Witness-2014-Feedback_on_draft_national_land_policy-en.pdf;;;;

OBL:62665;Destination Unknown: Hope and Doubt Regarding IDP Resettlement in Mon State;;"Executive Summary: ""The growing optimism surrounding Burma’s political and social
transitions has begun to be accompanied by ambitions to resettle
displaced communities along the country’s border with Thailand. As
the notion and its attendant proposals continue to proliferate, it
seems timely to assess how the communities directly affected by this
prospect feel about resettlement. Interviews were conducted with 61
Mon internally displaced people (IDPs) who expressed an array of
views ranging from excitement for better jobs in new locations to
utter refusal for fear of renewed conflict.
Concerns in the IDP community that relocation could lead to a
recurrence of violence or exploitation may seem unfounded to those
flushed with enthusiasm for Burma’s brisk pace of reform. However, it
is precisely because of this rapid shift, after fifty years of a deeply
entrenched system of repression, that many ethnic communities are
unable to abruptly shed their enduring memories of systematic
injustice. Similarly, for people in remote areas, there has not yet been
adequate evidence of improvements to daily life or sufficient trust
built between disparate groups to warrant immediate, broad-based
support.
Importantly, almost all interviewees that addressed resettlement
used “if” to describe their opinions, explaining that relocation is
attractive only if adequate security, employment, education, and
healthcare services are provided. This highlights fundamental

priorities among IDPs, but also showcases the lack of information
currently granted to internally displaced people. For those that had
heard about relocation, many did not know if it was true, or where
and when they might go, or if it even applied to them.
This incomplete information sharing has led to resettlement
constituting little more than a rumor in IDP sites, and the consequent
anxiety and confusion has been unnecessary and detrimental. The
process needed to develop resettlement programs offers a singular
opportunity to build trust with IDP communities by employing an
inclusive and participatory approach.
The varying opinions and levels of support for resettlement
demonstrated in this report serve as a key indicator that the IDP
community is not a homogeneous group about which conclusions can
be easily or independently reached. Some IDPs reported enjoying new
freedoms and infrastructure projects, while other accounts were
framed by doubt, exhibiting vivid memories of past abuses and few
observations of significant change. In any case, each individual IDP or
IDP family has a unique set of values and experiences that will define
what an agreeable future looks like, and each must be given the
chance to make free, prior, and informed decisions regarding
engagement with resettlement programs.
This report’s primary aim is to amplify the voices of Mon IDPs and
encourage the incorporation of their opinions into the development
of resettlement agendas. We urge that the President Thein Sein
government, the New Mon State Party, and associated international
organizations be directly accountable to IDP populations by respecting
their narratives and promoting full transparency in every stage of the
process. While recent, positive changes may provide compelling
reasons for people to return, they should not completely overwhelm
considerations of why they left.";;;Human Rights Foundation of Monland;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;18-10-2012;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62665;http://www.rehmonnya.org/upload/Destination-Unknown.pdf;;;;

problems which pose the greatest challenge to Myanmar. Therefore, it is expected that the 
""Voice From The Farm"" paper will be supportive to a certain extent. This paper was compiled 
based on cases that reached the office of 88 Generation Peace and Open Society from 
respective region and reinforced with discussions resulting from the VOICE OF 
FARMERprogramme which collects and organizes farmers' voices as well as with observations 
during field trips to rural areas.
Out of those which reached the office, 800 were selected and reviewed. The review of the cases 
was made after dividing them into six categories, namely, 1) problems concerned with the 
government, 2) problems concerned with the army, 3) problems concerned with companies, 4) 
problems concerned with organizations, 5) other problems and 6) farm land crimes. Upon 
reviewing, the problems concerned with the government counts 394 (49%) and stand as the 
greatest number. Problems concerned with the government involve ministries, administration 
departments, corporations, respective levels of local administrative bodies and individuals from 
them. Upon categorizing the cases based on their type, the cases about land seizures count 606 
(76%) and end up being highest. Out of these land seizures, the army's seizures count 99 (16%) 
and stand as the second highest. (This numbers are based on the count of the cases not on the 
total number of acres.). Out of cases from respective states and regions, 232 cases are from 
Ayeyarwaddy Region, 149 from Yangon Region, 88 from Mandalay Region and they stand at 
the top among Regions. Out of the states, Shan State has 33 cases and is at the top among 
States.
It is found that most of the cases involve township and village authorities and individuals from 
Land Record Department. Besides, local military units, police forces and the wealthy are also 
found involved in the cases. Names of top-ranking government members, parliamentarians and 
military officials are also found among those who carried out seizures.
Land problems arise because of projects and town area and military area expansions. Seizures 
greater than necessary are found in many. It is also found that seized landhas been left vacant 
without any businesses operations on them, leased back to former owners or others on a rental 
basis, made over into plots and sold out and shared for self interests. Farm land pieces with 
legal deeds and grant certificatesare also found to have been seized. Besides, it is found that 
authorities and the wealthy connived at seizing public religious land pieces, cemetery land 
pieces and pasture land pieces. It is also observed that people with low basic education and 
little knowledge were tricked by various means including undue pressure and threats into 
signing their consents. That power was abused against the law is obviouslyfound in incidents 
whereland pieces were seized and returned by verbal orders and promises were not delivered. 
Worst, there are cases where land pieces were seized in a style of robberies with such bullying 
acts as show of guns or gun fires into the air. Farmers are being bullied to the point that not

only their land pieces were seized, but also they were framed up with charges and sent to jail. 
It is also found that farmers came to face difficulties because land pieces given as replacements 
for seized ones are not cultivable, raw andsituated on sides of ravines. Such injustice is also 
found as compensations were not obtained in full amount, promises were not delivered and 
only 20 feet x 60 feet plots were given despite 40 feet x 60 feet ones were promised. There are 
incidents where companies and the army turned their land tenants against former land owner 
farmers.
It is viewed that most of above-mentioned land problems have arisen because of power abuses, 
corruptions and poor administration and management.Therefore, in resolving land problems, 
rule of law is crucial. Power abuse and bribery needs to be effectively combated. Legislation 
and statements by the Union Government and the Parliament alone will not be able to resolve 
the problems; accountability at various regional levels is needed.
Responsibilities that must be urgently undertaken are drawing and amending laws, bye laws 
and land policies which can guarantee the interests of vast majority of national rural populace. 
Most of land problems are found to have arisen due to weaknesses of Land Record Department. 
Reforming Land Record Department in line with the current era, taking of a land census and 
readjusting maps with ground situations need to be undertaken without delay. Moreover, since 
promotion of role of farmers' unions can directly secure public participation, it can be largely 
supportive to resolving land problems. In a nut shell, the extent to which land problems can be 
resolved greatly hinges on how willing the government in power is to serve the interests of 
farmers.";;;88 Generation Peace and Open Society (Agri-business and Farmer Affairs Department);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-12-2014;en;"land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71732;http://burmalibrary.org/docs22/88Gen-2014-12-30-Voice_from_the_Farm-en-tpo.pdf;;;;
OBL:71731;Securing the Right to Land;;"Set against the backdrop of escalating food prices
and worsening food insecurity, the issue of land
becomes more relevant and urgent. The facts and figures
speak of a great irony. More than half a billion people
in Asia suffer from hunger and food insecurity, and too
often these are the small food producers, who comprise
farm laborers, tenants and small farmers. The region is
home to 75% of the world’s farming households, 80%
of which are resource-poor, and lack access to productive
land.
Farmers’ and rural food producers’ lives are closely
bound up with their lands, which are their source of food
and livelihood as well as their best chance of escaping
poverty. For indigenous peoples (IPs), securing recognition
of their customary rights to ancestral lands is indispensable
to their right to self-determination, cultural integrity
and identity. Unfortunately, these and other groups that
till the land and depend on it for their survival have
least access to it.
Across many countries, improving access to land is
key to solving many social problems, including rural
unemployment, poverty, food insecurity, rural-urban
migration, and political stability. Increasingly, the land
access issue has been seen as a major reason behind
armed conflict, domestic violence, corruption, internal
displacement, structural violence and other social ills......

OBL:71730;Water Security Critical for World Fastest-Growing Economy;;" Lack of water management and limited access to data risk hindering Myanmar’s economic growth, making water security a top priority of the new government.

Climate change and increased urbanisation, along with earthquakes, cyclones, periodic flooding and major drought, require an urgent infrastructural upgrade if the country is to undergo a successful integration into the global economy after five decades of economic isolation under military rule.

“Water resources are abundant in Myanmar. However, we need to manage it properly to get adequate and clean water,” said Yangon regional government chief minister U Phyo Min Thein, attending a high-level roundtable on water security organised by Stockholm-based facilitator Global Water Partnership on May 24 in Yangon.

According to IMF data, Myanmar is the fastest growing economy in the world, following an easing of sanctions in 2011, when the military handed power to a semi-civilian reformist government.

“Water security is a priority for the new government,” said Myanmar’s deputy minister of Transport and Communication U Kyaw Myo.

The challenges inherited by the now de facto leader of the country Aung San Suu Kyi, however, are enormous. An expected industrial development and urbanisation boom are only going to make more urgent the need for efficient water management solutions in one of the most challenging areas of South Asia...";;;Inter Press Service (IPS);Online Burma/Myanmar Library;24-05-2016;en;water management;;Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/71730;http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/05/water-security-critical-for-world-fastest-growing-economy/;;;;

OBL:62069;Losing Ground: Land conflicts and collective action in eastern Myanmar;;"Analysis of KHRG's field information gathered between January 2011 and November 2012 in seven geographic research areas in eastern Myanmar indicates that natural resource extraction and development projects undertaken or facilitated by civil and military State authorities, armed ethnic groups and private investors resulted in land confiscation and forced displacement, and were implemented without consulting, compensating or notifying project-affected communities. Exclusion from decision-making and displacement and barriers to land access present major obstacles to effective local-level response, while current legislation does not provide easily accessible mechanisms to allow their complaints to be heard. Despite this, villagers employ forms of collective action that provide viable avenues to gain representation, compensation and forestall expropriation. Key findings in this report were drawn based upon analysis of four trends, including: Lack of consultation; Land confiscation; Disputed compensation; and Development-induced displacement and resettlement, as well as four collective action strategies, including: Reporting to authorities; Organizing a committee or protest; Negotiation; and Non-compliance, and six consequences on communities, including: Negative impacts on livelihoods; Environmental impacts; Physical security threats; Forced labour and exploitative demands; Denial of access to humanitarian goods and services; and Migration.";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;05-03-2013;en;"security of tenure (land);land grabbing;expropriation";;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/62069;http://burmalibrary.org/KHRG/KHRG%202013/KHRG-2013-03-05-Losing_Ground_Land_conflicts_collective_action_in_eastern_Myanmar_report-en.pdf;;;;

nationalities are residing collectively and widely in 7 Regions, 7
States and Union Territory. The country is located in Southeast
Asia and is important geographically, economically and politically
in the region.
2. Moreover, Myanmar is a country that has rich natural resources and
environment, including valuable forests, fertile planes, natural gas
and mineral deposits, long coastline, mountain ranges, and rivers
such as the Ayeyarwaddy, Chindwin, Thanlwin, Sittaung, which
are the lifeblood of the country.
3. The land resources shall be managed, administered and used, with
special attention, by adopting long-term objectives for the
livelihood improvement of the citizens and sustainable
development of the country. When the land resources are
systematically used and well managed, the more it will be possible
to fulfill the basic needs of the citizens, develop the social and
economic life of the people, and develop the country harmoniously.
4. Under section 37 of the Constitution of the Republic of the Union
of Myanmar, it is provided that the Union is the ultimate owner of
all lands in the Union, shall enact necessary law to supervise
extraction and utilization of State-owned natural resources by
economic forces; shall permit citizens right of private property,
right of inheritance, right of private initiative and patent in accord
with the law. According to such provision, the President of the
Union also guided on 19th June, 2012 to adopt a necessary, strong
and precise policy for the sustainable management, administration2
and use of the land resources of the country, as such, ""the National
Land Use Policy ""has been developed.
5. This National Land Use Policy aims to implement, manage and
carry out land use and tenure rights in the country systematically
and successfully, including both urban and rural areas, in
accordance with the objectives of the Policy and shall be the guide
for the development and enactment of a National Land Law,

OBL:100428;Securing Livelihoods and Land Tenure in Rural Myanmar;;"Executive Summary: ""In the context of transition to a more open form of
 government, the Myanmar government has 
begun to liberalize land markets and, in 2012, enacted two major land-related laws. 
Implementing these new land laws has proven challenging, however, as it has been difficult to 
integrate these laws with the existing customary practices of various ethnic minorities. To 
address these and other issues UN-HABITAT Myanmar is assisting the Myanmar government in 
developing a 
Land Administration and Management Program 
(LAMP). 
As part of this process a team of Masters Students 
from Columbia University’s School of 
International and Public Affairs (SIPA) was invited
 to carry out a detailed study on customary 
land tenure in the southern area of Myanmar’s Shan 
State with a focus on three ethnic groups: 
the Shan, Pa-o, and Danu. The SIPA team completed a
 desk review of secondary source material 
and conducted two phases of field research. The first phase of field research was conducted in 
Yangon in January 2013 with the purpose of identifying opportunities and challenges the new 
land laws present. The second phase of field research sought to gather the impressions of 
farmers, community leaders, and local government representatives in southern Shan State. 
Information was gathered during a three-day “worksh
op” conducted in Taunggyi, the capital city 
of Shan State. 
The SIPA team’s objectives were to provide UN-HABIT
AT Myanmar and the Myanmar 
government with needed information on three topics:
 1) prevailing ideas on best practices in 
land management and registration procedures, 2) successful and unsuccessful land management 
practices in comparable countries in the region, and 3) the current status of customary land 
tenure and of the implementation process of the new
 land laws in Southern Shan State...";"Jesse Baver

OBL:64850;Damming at Gunpoint (Burmese);;"BURMA ARMY ATROCITIES PAVE THE WAY FOR SALWEEN DAMS IN KAREN STATE... ""As Thailand proceeds with plans to join Burma’s military regime in building a series of dams on the Salween River to gain “cheap” electricity, this report reveals the atrocities being inflicted on the people of Northern Karen State to pave the way for two of the planned dams. The Upper Salween (Wei Gyi) Dam and Lower Salween (Dar Gwin) Dam are planned to be built on the river where it forms the border between Thailand’s Mae Hong Son province and Burma’s Karen State. Together they will produce about 5,300 MW of electricity. It is estimated that the reservoir for the Upper Dam will stretch for 380 kilometers inside Karen and Karenni States of Burma. Both dams are located at the eastern edge of Papun district in Karen State. Once a Karen liberated area, during the last decade Papun has been the site of repeated military offensives and anti-insurgency campaigns by the regime’s troops to crush the Karen resistance. Before 1992, there were only ten Burma Army garrisons in Papun district. Today there are fifty-four garrisons, including twelve along the Salween river bank, fortified with heavy artillery. The military campaigns have decimated the local population. 210 villages have been destroyed, and villagers forcibly relocated to 31 relocation sites, where movement has been strictly controlled, and villagers are subject to forced labour and other human rights abuses. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled to Thailand as refugees; others live in hiding in the jungle, where they live in constant fear of being found and tortured or killed. In 1992, there were estimated to be about 107,000 people in Papun district. Now this has been halved to about 54,000, of whom about 35,000, or 60%, are internally displaced in the jungles. The rest have fled to Thailand or other parts of Burma. Out of 85 original villages in the mountainous area of Eastern Papun directly adjoining the planned dam sites, only a quarter remain. Most of the communities who had farmed and traded along the Salween River have fled to Thailand, and many farms in the fertile tributary valleys have been lying fallow for over a decade. Over 5,000 villagers remain hiding in the jungle, facing severe food shortages and health problems. Roads to the planned dam sites have been built using forced labour, and landmines have been planted alongside the roads. There has been no consultation with local communities about the dam plans. If the dams are built, the floodwaters will permanently displace many of the communities currently in hiding or living as refugees in Thailand. The increased military security for the dam sites will also inevitably mean further abuses against local populations. The Salween dams fit into the ongoing strategy of the Burmese military regime to use “development” projects to gain funding and collusion from neighbouring countries to subjugate ethnic resistance movements, and exploit the natural resources in the ethnic areas.

European countries –increased development aid and 
allowed their businesses to operate in Myanmar for the 
first time in decades.
This 
investment has been touted as a way to improve 
economic conditions for the people of Myanmar, one of 
the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, following years 
of government mismanagement, corruption, and 
economic sanctions that destroyed the country’s 
economy.2
While the opening in Myanmar has allowed 
foreign investment to soar and made new capital 
available for plantations, logging, special economic 
zones, deep sea ports, hydroelectric dams, and mining 
concessions, all of these types of projects have been 
associated with unlawful land confiscations from 
individuals and communities with little or no 
compensation.
Economic development projects in Myanmar are causing 
widespread displacement and are having devastating 
impacts on those communities living in project 
locations, including human rights violations and adverse 
effects on livelihoods, food security, and health. For 
those subjected to unlawful evictions 
and 
land grabs, 
the consequences are dire, driving many 
people 
into 
poverty. Government policy has encouraged the 
development of these projects, and weak and unclear 
land policies, including some new land laws written to 
support investment and economic growth, have 
provided the government, military, and businesses with 
legal cover to confiscate people’s land without a 
transparent process for determining and awarding 
compensation.
In the following report, Physicians for Human Rights 
(PHR) builds on its previous research on land 
confiscations in Myanmar by using an epidemiological 
survey tool to assess the human rights, livelihood, and 
health impacts on communities displaced by the 
reservoir created by Paunglaung dam in southern Shan

OBL:72924;Are the Odds for Justice ‘Stacked Against’ Them? Challenges and Opportunities to Securing Land Claims by Smallholder Farmers in Myanmar;;"Abstract: 
""In 2012, the Government of Myanmar (GoM) passed 
the Farmland Law and the Vacant, Fallow, Virgin 
(VFV) Land Law—creating a formalized land market. In essence, this created a formalized land 
market. Land titling is often considered “the natural end point of land rights formalization” (Hall et al. 
2010: 35). This thinking has become dominant among most governments and development agencies 
ever since De Soto (2000) popularized it in 
The Mystery of Capital
, in which he argued that the 
developmental successes of the West has relied on a 
strong legally-enforceable
 institution of property 
rights, without which assets, particularly land, would become “dead capital.” 
In reality, there are at least two major obstacles in achieving this in Myanmar. The
 first
 is around the 
legacy of multiple regimes in creating “stacked laws” 
(Roquas 2002). This term refers to a situation in 
which a country has multiple layers of laws that exist simultaneously, creating conflicts and 
contradictions in the legal system, as well as challenges to creating a well-regulated land market 
envisioned by the Myanmar state with 
the passage of the two land laws. The 
second
 obstacle has to do 
with the fact that like many countries in the world, access to legal justice in Myanmar is dependent on 
one’s access to different material, social and political resources—directly to a history of patron-clientelism. Through a number of select case 
studies, this paper seeks to provide preliminary 
reflections on the following question: In Myanmar, a country with a porous legal framework, how do 
smallholder farmers engage with the law, and where 
relevant, informal norms to strengthen legitimacy 
of their claims to land against confiscations? 
This paper seeks to contribute to the literature on 
agrarian rural movements by focusing specifically on 
the way farming communities in Myanmar engage with the law, while paying attention to the 
complications they face when they engage with 
legal institutions that are porous and ‘stacked’—a 
phenomena that is common to many countries in the early phases of rural democratization......

potential and environmental protection takes greater priorities within the country. In this paper delivered at at a China - ASEAN power forum attended by hundreds of executives of leading PRC power companies, Zao Noam and Piaporn Deetes of Thailand argue that the social and environmental impacts from hydropower development in the Mekong countries must be seriously addressed in order to mitigate damaging impacts to regional economies, food security and rural livelihoods.

careful consideration of hydropower's multi-faceted impacts, millions of small farmers and fisher folk whose livelihoods depend on the richness of the Mekong ecosystems will bear most of the costs of the infrastructure development. Civil society in the Mekong region urges the Chinese corporate

OBL:43758;The Shwe Gas Movement;;"The SHWE Gas Movement is concerned with a natural gas pipeline project presently unfolding in Western Burma...

In cooperation with Burma's military junta, a consortium of Indian and Korean corporations are currently exploring gas fields off the coast of Arakan State in Western Burma. Discovered in December 2003, these fields--labeled A-1, or ""Shwe"" (the Burmese word for gold)--are expected to hold one of the largest gas yields in Southeast Asia. These Shwe fields could well become the Burmese military government's largest single source of foreign income...

However, for the people of Burma this project will likely bring more suffering than benefits. It is the opinion of the SHWE Gas Movement that the following issues are very likely outcomes if the pipeline project goes ahead unchecked:...
Exploitation of the Voiceless:

In order to transport the gas to India, a pipeline corridor is already being cleared in the minority Burmese states of Arakan and Chin. Moreover, the area is becoming increasingly militarised and forced labour is occurring in the context of infrastructure development...
Large-scale Human Rights Abuses and Militarisation:

As experience with two previous international Burmese gas pipeline projects -- the Yadana and the Yetagun -- suggest, forced relocation of villagers, forced labour, torture, rape and extrajudicial killings will result from the Shwe project...
Environmental and Cultural Destruction:

Because proper social and environmental impact assessments have not been carried out, the extent of the project's impact on the local population and environment can hardly be determined, but the Burmese military has a long history of environmental and cultural degradation...
The Entrenchment of the Burmese Military Regime:

Just as the Yadana and Yetagun projects provided a context for the Burmese military regime to extend its reach into minority and opposition areas, so too is the Shwe project providing an excuse to further militarize and exploit the frontier areas of Arakan and Chin state. Meanwhile, when the money from this project begins flowing into the junta's coffers, this will only increase the military's grip over the rest of Burma.

Burma's current state of affairs is well known. The regime's poor human rights record has led most governments and many international organisations and institutions to condemn Burma's state terror and pass sanctions and investment bans against the country. This approach, also supported by the majority of Burma's opposition movement and Nobel Peace Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is meant to apply economic and political pressure on the regime and kick-start a process of democratisation.

At the same time, several countries, such as the regional neighbours Thailand, India, China and Malaysia, promote constructive engagement with the regime as opposed to international isolation. According to their arguments, constructive engagement will promote economic development, integrate the country into the international community, and eventually instigate a full transfer to democracy.

To date, however, progress in democratisation and human rights is yet to show, which seriously questions the viability of constructive engagement. Indeed, most foreign investment and development projects have caused more suffering than good because of the direct involvement of Burma's military. Thus, as argued by the Nobel Laureate and winner of the 1990 elections in Burma, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, ""until we have a system that guarantees rules of law and basic democratic institutions, no amount of aid or investment will benefit our people.""

We, the SHWE Gas Movement, ask the governments and corporations involved to halt the project until there is assurance that the people of the whole of Burma and Western Burma in particular can participate in the decision-making process and benefit from this project and not suffer the same fate as the people affected by the Yadana and the Yetagun pipelines. We ask you for your support in achieving this goal.";;;Shwe Gas Movement;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;;en;"land investments;extractive industries";Land & Investments;"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/43758;http://www.shwe.org/;;;;

OBL:66745;The “Everyday Politics” of IDP Protection in Karen State;;"Abstract: ""While international humanitarian access in Burma has opened up
over the past decade and a half, the ongoing debate regarding the appropriate
relationship between politics and humanitarian assistance remains unresolved.
This debate has become especially limiting in regards to protection
measures for internally displaced persons (IDPs) which are increasingly seen
to fall within the mandate of humanitarian agencies. Conventional IDP
protection frameworks are biased towards a top-down model of politicallyaverse
intervention which marginalises local initiatives to resist abuse and
hinders local control over protection efforts. Yet such local resistance strategies
remain the most effective IDP protection measures currently employed
in Karen State and other parts of rural Burma. Addressing the protection
needs and underlying humanitarian concerns of displaced and potentially
displaced people is thus inseparable from engagement with the “everyday
politics” of rural villagers. This article seeks to challenge conventional notions
of IDP protection that prioritise a form of state-centric “neutrality”
and marginalise the “everyday politics” through which local villagers continue
to resist abuse and claim their rights..."".....

OBL:74774;ADDRESSING THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF ‘LAND GRABBING’;;This Study discusses the human rights issues raised by large-scale land deals for plantation agriculture (‘land grabbing’) in low and middle-income countries. Firstly, the Study takes stock of available data on large land deals, their features and their driving forces. It finds that ‘land grabbing’ is a serious issue requiring urgent attention. Secondly, the Study conceptualises the link between land deals and human rights, reviews relevant international human rights law and discusses evidence on actual and potential human rights impacts. It finds that important human rights dimensions are at stake, and that compressions of human rights have been documented in some contexts. Thirdly, the Study identifies the areas of EU policy that are most directly relevant to addressing the human rights impacts of ‘land grabbing’, and in so doing it also briefly discusses developments in home and host countries as well as internationally. Fourthly, the Study proposes courses of action by which the EU, and the European Parliament in particular, can further prevent or remedy human rights violations linked to large-scale land deals.;Lorenzo COTULA;;International Institute for Environment and Development;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;10-12-2014;en;"land governance;land grabbing;land tenure;forestry;land rights;land tenure systems";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/74774;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/IIED-2014-%20Land_Grabbing_%26_HR-en.pdf;;;;

The report includes information submitted by KHRG community members on a range of human rights abuses and issues of importance to local communities including land confiscation, militarisation, fighting between armed groups, commercial activity carried out by military actors, violent abuse, access to education, access to healthcare, and development projects.
• There have been ongoing cases of land confiscation at the hands of the Tatmadaw, for the purpose of building Burma/Myanmar government offices, establishing military target practice areas and increasingly, for plantations, commercial projects, and sale to private companies.
• Militarisation in Toungoo District has continued, despite the 2012 preliminary ceasefire between the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Burma/Myanmar government, with the Tatmadaw rotating troops and replenishing their rations and ammunitions at camps in remote areas.
• A local militia, the Thandaung Special Region Peace Group, have been engaged in several commercial activities, including running gambling areas, logging, and stone mining, in order to raise funds to support their operations. All of these activities have had a disruptive effect on villagers, in particular the school students.
• The Burma/Myanmar government has invested in providing financial support for school students in standards one to four in Toungoo District, however this has not always been effective as in some cases the money does not reach the students.
• There continues to be a lack of access to adequate healthcare in Toungoo District; the Burma/Myanmar government has only built clinics in the village tracts close to main roads, there is a shortage of properly trained healthcare workers and in the case of villagers with lower incomes, treatment is often too expensive.

OBL:43245;"""They Came and Destroyed Our Village Again""-- The Plight of Internally Displaced Persons in Karen State";;"...While the nonviolent struggle of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi against the Burmese military government’s continuing repression has captured the world’s attention, the profound human rights and humanitarian crisis endured by Burma’s ethnic minority communities has largely been ignored.4

Decades of armed conflict have devastated ethnic minority communities, which make up approximately 35 percent of Burma’s population. The Burmese army, or Tatmadaw, has for many years carried out numerous and widespread summary executions, looting, torture, rape and other sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and torture, forced labor, recruitment of child soldiers, and the displacement and demolition of entire villages as part of military operations against ethnic minority armed opposition groups. Civilians bear the brunt of a state of almost perpetual conflict and militarization.

Violations of international human rights and humanitarian law (the laws of war) by the Tatmadaw have been particularly acute in eastern Karen state, which runs along the northwestern border of Thailand...One result of the Tatmadaw’s brutal behavior has been the creation of large numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees among Burma’s ethnic minority communities. Conflict and its consequences have been going on for so long that in many ethnic minority-populated areas, continuous forced relocations and displacement––interspersed with occasional periods of relative stability––have become a fact of life for generations of poor villagers.

The scale of the IDP problem in Burma is daunting. Estimates suggest that, as of late 2004, as many as 650,000 people were internally displaced in eastern Burma alone. According to a recent survey, 157,000 civilians have been displaced in eastern Burma since the end of 2002, and at least 240 villages destroyed, relocated, or abandoned. The majority of displaced people live in areas controlled by the government, now known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), or by various ethnic armed groups that have agreed to ceasefires with the government. But approximately eighty-four thousand displaced people live in zones of ongoing armed conflict, where the worst human rights abuses continue. Many IDPs live in hiding in war zones. Another two million Burmese live in Thailand, including 145,000 refugees living in camps.

Karen State is the location of some of the largest numbers of IDPs in Burma. Since 2002, approximately 100,000 people have been displaced from Karen areas,which include parts of Pegu and Tenasserim Divisions. Though a provisional ceasefire was agreed in December 2003 between the SPDC and the Karen National Union (KNU), sporadic fighting continues. Tatmadaw military operations against the KNU’s army, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), in the first months of 2005 caused numerous deaths and injuries to civilians in poor villages along the Thai border. They also forced many civilians to flee internally or to Thailand. For example, at least 9,000 civilians were displaced in Toungoo District, in the far north of Karen State bordering Karenni State, and in Nyaunglebin District in northwest Karen State, during major Tatmadaw offensives between November 2004 and February 2005.

The majority of Karen IDPs have been forced out of their homes as a direct result of the Tatmadaw’s “Four Cuts” counter-insurgency strategy, in which the Burmese army has attempted to defeat armed ethnic groups by denying them access to food, funds, recruits, and information from other insurgent groups...";;;Human Rights Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;09-06-2005;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/43245;http://hrw.org/reports/2005/burma0605/burma0605.pdf;;;;

OBL:65134;Land confiscation threatens villagers' livelihoods in Dooplaya District;;In September 2011, residents of Je--- village, Kawkareik Township told KHRG that they feared soldiers under Tatmadaw Border Guard Battalion #1022 and LIBs #355 and #546 would soon complete the confiscation of approximately 500 acres of land in their community in order to develop a large camp for Battalion #1022 and homes for soldiers' families. According to the villagers, the area has already been surveyed and the Je--- village head has informed local plantation and paddy farm owners whose lands are to be confiscated. The villagers reported that approximately 167 acres of agricultural land, including seven rubber plantations, nine paddy farms, and seventeen betelnut and durian plantations belonging to 26 residents of Je--- have already been surveyed, although they expressed concern that more land would be expropriated in the future. The Je--- residents said that the village head had told them rubber plantation owners would be compensated according to the number of trees they owned, but that the villagers were collectively refusing compensation and avoiding attending a meeting at which they worried they would be ordered to sign over their land. The villagers that spoke with KHRG said they believed the Tatmadaw intended to take over their land in October after the end of the annual monsoon, and that this would seriously undermine livelihoods in a community in which many villagers depended on subsistence agriculture on established land. This bulletin is based on information collected by KHRG researchers in September and October 2011, including five interviews with residents of Je--- village, 91 photographs of the area, and a written record of lands earmarked for confiscation.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-10-2011;en;"land conflicts;farmland;food security;expropriation;farming systems;land grabbing;land rights;security of tenure (land)";"Land Conflicts;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/65134;http://burmalibrary.org/docs20/KHRG-2011-10-31-Land_confiscation_threatens_villagers_livelihoods_in_Dooplaya_District-en.pdf;;;;

Specifically, the report describes Tatmadaw IB #57 imposing taxation over 40 villagers mining gold for their livelihoods. The report also describes the attempt of the Myanmar Peace Support Initiative to send food supplies by truck to Hsaw Mee Luh base camp in August 2012, as well as the placing and marking of an anti-vehicle mine by KNLA Battalion #9 soldiers between Kat Pe base camp and Mu Theh village. Flooding in Kyauk Kyi area that started in July is also reported, which caused villagers problems with travel and work and destroyed rice paddies. World Food Programme staff visited flood victims and provided some relief during this time as well and, in August, Back Pack Health Worker Team members distributed rice on behalf of Emergency Assistance Team-Burma and also delivered soap and medicine to flood victims in Ma Au Pin village tract. During the period of flooding, villagers were worried that if gold mining operations continued along the Tha Ye stream that polluted water would contaminate their paddies and cause destruction. Villagers thus requested that gold mining stop during the floods. This request was not heeded, and all paddies in 30 acres of flat field farms died during flooding. The report also details that road builders and village officials demanded 200 kyat (US $.21) from each traveler along the road through M--- village, including students from the M--- primary school.

OBL:72060;Legally and Illegally Logged Out: Drivers of Deforestation & Forest Degradation in Myanmar;;"... Myanmar’s forest and timber sector has been central to the country’s economy and society, particularly over the last century. Since the colonial era, timber has been a major export revenue earner to Burma/Myanmar and thus subject to much political debate (Bryant 1996). In addition to timber export revenues, the forests of Myanmar have always provided timber and non-timber forest products for domestic consumption as well as a range of environmental services including water catchment, habitat for flora and fauna, carbon storage, and soil nutrient recovery in rotational agriculture.

Myanmar’s forests have contained some of the most valued timbers in the world – particularly rosewoods and teak. Now, amidst unprecedented political reforms in Myanmar, the forest and timber sector is currently undergoing a process of reform. This is indicated by a number of policy changes, most significantly:
1. The 2014 Log Export Ban – which has made it illegal to export unprocessed logs
2. The Government’s engagement in a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) process with the European Union’s Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative, requiring transparency and compliance improvements that are mutually agreed upon between the government, the timber sector and civil society.

This policy redirection is essential, although long overdue. Practical implementation is inevitably going to take time and face obstacles as powerful political-economic interests allied to the former military regime will seek to maintain their access to timber and land as well as control over revenue flows associated with the commercial utilisation of these national resources.

Meanwhile the Ministry of Environment Conservation and Forestry (MOECAF) is under strong pressure from international timber traders to increase supply, more evidently recent pressure from China, and also missions from European and US timber sector representatives. This pressure is due to a combination of factors; growing demand around the world, declining supply of tropical hardwood from shrinking forests, and growing stringency around compliance concerning illegal sourcing.

In order to respond to these pressures the authors have tried to clarify the status of the timber industry, the status of the forest resource including its management, and the challenges for reform...";"Thorsten Treue

OBL:75558;A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma: Forced Displacement in the Thilawa Special Economic Zone;;"Conclusion:
""The displacement in Thilawa took place amid a broader
climate of state-sponsored abuse in Burma, where
people have no recourse to challenge illegal government
action. Specifically, the displacement process in Thilawa
violated residents’ human rights, negatively affected
their ability to provide for themselves, and resulted in
deteriorating food security and limited ability to access
health care. The TSEZMC will relocate 846 more
households when development begins on phase two of
the project. If the TSEZMC, the Burmese government,
and JICA continue to operate as they did in the first
phase of the project, these households will suffer the
same fate.
Burma requires economic development, but given the
historical context of forced displacement, impunity for
human rights violations, weak rule of law, and
corruption, there is great risk that economic
development projects will benefit a select few in power
at the expense of deepened deprivation and poverty for
many others. Although the results of this survey cannot
be generalized for the country as a whole, the survey
does highlight risks inherent to any major development
project in Burma. Having recently emerged from more
than 50 years of military dictatorship, it will take time
and commitment to build a strong civil society that is
capable of educating people in Burma about their rights.
Residents generally fear their government, which for
decades has controlled the population by force. The
government has yet to implement sufficient
mechanisms to protect people from human rights
abuses and ensure justice for victims.
Given this context, any development project in the
country carries great risk of human rights violations.
JICA and other organizations implementing such
projects should make every effort to proactively identify
the potential negative outcomes and consult with the
affected community about how best to minimize or
eliminate these risks. The Thilawa case suggests that
foreign organizations cannot rely on the Burmese
government to protect the human rights of forcibly displaced
populations...";"Andrea Gittleman

The focus of the study concentrates on four different ethnic groups, Karen, Karenni, Palaung and Shan by looking at children from the age between 4-13 years old to identify factors that are involved when these migrant children move back to Burma. At the same time, for many children who spent most of their lives in Thailand, it is interesting to see the possibilities and challenges for them in relating to accessing to education since Burma is a new home for many of them. Therefore, it is also interesting to see how the Burma government as well as the Thai education system will respond to this issue of educational development in the changing economic and democratic processes of these countries."".....Paper delivered at the International Conference on Burma/Myanmar Studies: Burma/Myanmar in Transition: Connectivity, Changes and Challenges: University Academic Service Centre (UNISERV), Chiang Mai University, Thailand, 24-­26 July 2015.";Sutthida Keereepaibool;;"International Conference on Burma/Myanmar Studies.

OBL:72061;Land Suitability for Oil Palm in Southern Myanmar;;"... The first commercial small-scale oil palm plantations were introduced to Myanmar in 1926 covering 120 ha. In the 1980’s the European Economic Community and Swiss
government implemented a palm oil project to stimulate growth in the sector. As of 2014 401,813 ha have been allocated and 134,539 ha planted. The government
target is to plant 282,470 ha by 2030. The land is allocated to 44 companies, comprising 43 local companies and one Foreign Direct Investment. Three foreign
companies have joint-ventures with local companies. Although much land is now planted, there appears to be significant scope to improve yields with better technical
capacity and planting material. Down-stream, there are five mills owned by three companies with crude palm oil (CPO) processing capacity varying from 1.5 to 60 tonnes of fresh fruit bunch per hour (Zaw Win, 2014). Expansion of mills currently faces financing constraints.

The main driver for expansion is to meet domestic demand for edible oil; there are 60 million people in Myanmar consuming 400-500,000 metric tonnes of edible oil (palm
oil, sesame and ground nut). Myanmar is importing palm oil; in 2012 this was 330,000 metric tonnes with a value of $376 million from Indonesia and Malaysia. Self sufficiency in edible palm oil is a national target, but local production is currently dwarfed by these imports.

Oil palm plantations in Myanmar are principally found within a narrow belt of coastal lowlands in Myeik and Kawthaung Districts (Figure 1). Donald et al. 2014 report that potential productivity in this area is low by international standards (Figure 2) due to climatic conditions.

As a contribution to assessing the long term commercial viability of Myanmar’s oil palm industry, as well as its social and environmental impacts, we surveyed the agroecological conditions where it presently occurs and where it could be further developed. The Agritech Portal of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University states that,
“Oil palm requires evenly distributed annual rainfall [of at least] 2000 mm without a defined dry season. In areas with a dry spell, deep soil with high water holding capacity and a shallow water table augmented with copious irrigation will satisfy the water requirement of the oil palm.

“Temperature can be a limiting factor for oil palm production. Best oil palm yields are obtained in places where a maximum average temperature of 29o-33oC and minimum average temperature of 22o-24oC are available. Higher diurnal temperature variation causes floral abortion in regions with a dry season.”

Within Myanmar, annual rainfall, the presence of a distinct dry season (Figure 3) and elevation (an indicator of local variation in diurnal temperature range) already limit the
area suitable for plantations. Sandy loam soils restrict the potential for irrigation and make the requirements for fertilizer high. Across the entire country, the duration and
reliability of the wet season has decreased as climate variability has increased, and this trend is likely to continue...";"Stuart M. Sheppard

OBL:99303;Land in Myanmar: The Year in Review;;"Since 2012, land governance in Myanmar has been undergoing major changes. This article aims to capture the changes of the last year, framed through my perception of working as a consultant for a range of local NGOs, INGOs and donors. While this will inevitably be coloured by my own experience, I hope that I can present for wider discussion and reflection some of the key events and issues that I have found interesting over the past year...The Myanmar National Land Use Policy (NLUP) was published in March 2016, after 2 public consultations that took place during 2014 and 2015. This document represents an important step forward in land governance, not only due to its content, but also due to the consultative process through which NGOs and farmers across the country provided input and ideas for an initial draft, which was then used to develop the final version of the policy. This process was unprecedented in law development in Myanmar.

Since the new NLD government came to power at the end of March 2016, the status of the NLUP has become somewhat unclear, as authorities have not officially supported the policy’s implementation or the proposed National Land Law (an umbrella law for land under which the NLUP is situated). More recently, the Commission for the Assessment of Legal Affairs and Special Issues has put forward a series of proposed amendments to the NLUP which include removing sections on gender equality as well as protections around customary land governance. These are controversial recommendations for changes to articles that many civil society groups felt were key elements of the policy. At present, it is unclear if these amendments will be accepted by Parliament.

OBL:74398;How China Fuels Myanmar’s Wars;;"...When an estimated 50,000 ethnic Kokang civilians poured into southwest China last month to escape fighting between the Myanmar Army and Kokang rebels, Beijing called for peace and provided food, medical supplies and camps for the refugees. But China’s stance as a benevolent mediator in Myanmar’s many internal conflicts and its treatment of asylum seekers is far less altruistic than Beijing cares to admit.

The Myanmar military has been at war with dozens of ethnic groups for decades, fueled by long-burning animosities, competition over natural resources and minority demands for more autonomy. Kokang fighters, seeking to regain territory lost in 2009, are jockeying for a better position in nationwide cease-fire talks set to resume this month in Yangon.

OBL:57607;Conflict and displacement in Burma/Myanmar;;"...This chapter has described aspects of forced migration in Burma that
are under-researched, including the phenomenon of serial displacement,
and has proposed a three-part typology. Many internally displaced
persons and others move repeatedly, sometimes for a combination
of reasons; others have been displaced for some time and have found
at least semi-durable solutions to their plight; many are living mixed
with communities who are not—or have not recently been—displaced.
Forced migrants’ needs can be assessed and appropriate interventions
planned only if the full complexity of displacement situations in Burma
is understood. Humanitarian (and political) actors should therefore
respect and respond to the voices and agency of forced migrants
and enrol their participation in all aspects of program planning and
myanmar – the state, community 78 and the environment
implementation. In most cases, forced migrants and communities
threatened by displacement have special protection vulnerabilities
related to the causes of migration (especially armed and state–society
conflict). These concerns link humanitarian needs to explicitly political
issues. Ultimately, substantial and sustained protection from forced
migration, as well as the rehabilitation of displaced populations and
reconstruction of communities, depends on resolutions to the conflicts
that cause displacement in Burma. Unfortunately, efforts at conflict
resolution have thus far met with only limited success.,,";Ashley South;;2006 Burma Update Conference via Australian National University;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-12-2006;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/57607;http://burmalibrary.org/docs4/BU-2006-South.pdf;;;;

OBL:63587;Burning Homes, Sinking Lives - A situation report on violence against stateless Rohingya in Myanmar and their refoulement from Bangladesh;;"...this report documents the severity of the human rights abuses suffered by Rohingya within Myanmar – including mass violence, killings and attacks, the burning and destruction of property, arbitrary arrests, detention and disappearances, the deprivation of emergency healthcare and humanitarian aid. Such human rights abuses are being carried out with impunity by civilians and agents of the state alike. The organised and widespread nature of this state sponsored violence raises serious questions of crimes against humanity being committed by Myanmar.
This report also documents the refoulement of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh and related human rights violations, including the push-back of boats carrying Rohingya into dangerous waters and the failure to provide refuge, shelter and humanitarian aid to those fleeing persecution. Historically, the Rohingya have faced acute discrimination and human rights abuse in Myanmar, and Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution to Bangladesh have faced severe hardships including the lack of humanitarian aid, shelter and security. This present crisis is a tragic reminder of the vulnerabilities of stateless people when their countries of habitual residence and the international community fail to protect them. Urgent action is required to end the violence, protect the victims and bring those responsible to justice. Of equal importance is the need for a long-term process of reinstating Myanmar nationality to Rohingya who were arbitrarily deprived of a nationality in 1982, resolving ethnic conflicts and protecting the human rights and freedoms of Rohingya within Myanmar and in other countries.

OBL:42910;An Overview of the Market Chain for China's Timber Product Imports from Myanmar;;This article on China's forest trade with Myanmar builds on an earlier study by the same authors: “Navigating the Border: An Analysis of the China-Myanmar Timber Trade” [link]. The analysis in this study moves on to identify priority issues along the market chain of the timber trade from the Yunnan-Myanmar border to Guangdong Province and Shanghai on China’s eastern seaboard. Give the increased intensity of logging in northern Myanmar after the introduction of stringent limits on domestic timber production in China in 1998, the authors argue it is now downstream buyers on China’s eastern seaboard who are driving the timber business along the Yunnan Myanmar border. While the boom in the timber business has provided income generating opportunities for many, from villagers in Myanmar to Chinese migrant businessmen, forests that can be cost-effectively harvested in Myanmar along its border with Yunnan are in increasingly short supply. This entails a need to explore priority areas such as transitioning border residents away from a reliance on the timber industry, assessing and mitigating the cross-border ecological damage from logging in Kachin and Shan States, and developing a more sustainable supply of timber in Yunnan through improving state plantations and collective forest management.;"Fredrich Kahrl

Elsewhere in the article, however, it is clear that the analysis is of the adopted Law...

""The Farmland Law was enacted and approved by Burma Pyi Daung Su Hluttaw (Burma Union Parliament) on
March 30th, 2012.
According to the Farmland Law section 3 (a), “farmland means paddy land, ya land, kiang land, shifting-cultivated
land (taung ya), perennial plant land, dhani (coastal) land, orchards, and alluvial land.”
Under section 3 (b), “farmland means the land which is mainly for boosting agricultural production, and producing
naturally growing or man-made products that can be cultivated with an irrigation system.”
Analysis: Because farmland is defined as land primarily for the growth of agricultural production, it is an obstacle
for the farmers to cultivate their land freely. It gives the right to cultivate agricultural crops solely for the purpose
of agricultural production.

In September 2011, over 200 villagers from Th---, Sh---, G--- and M--- were forced to harvest beans and corn, an incident which is also described in the report ""Pa'an Situation Update: September 2011"", published by KHRG on November 25th 2011.

Information is also provided on the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) ceasefire with the Tatmadaw and their subsequent transformation into the Border Guard, and how this has reduced the capacity of soldiers to engage in mining and logging enterprises. The subsequent increase in pressure on villagers by DKBA and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) troops to resist Border Guard military recruitment demands had meant that village heads often fled, rather than serve their one-year term.

OBL:42823;Preliminary Survey Results about Burmese Migrant Workers in Thailand: State/division of origin, year of entry, minimum wages and work permits;;"1. INTRODUCTION:
People from Burma have been entering Thailand since the Ne Win coup in 1962. Most of these people have fled civil war, hunger, poverty, unemployment and political oppression. A significant proportion of these Burmese are employed in the lower rungs of the Thai labour market. Despite the large numbers of people from Burma working in Thailand, there has been very little reliable statistical analysis undertaken in order to understand the situation faced by these people. The paucity of reliable information in this area led us to conduct a survey of about 1,400 people from Burma working in Thailand.1 The survey was undertaken between October 2003 and March 2004, in the following 12 provinces:
• Bangkok
• Singburi
• Lopburi
• Saraburi
• Tak (Mae Sot District)
• Ratchaburi
• Kanchanburi (Kanchanaburi and Sangklaburi Districts)
• Ranong (Ranong District)
• Samut Sakhon (Mahachai)
• Phetchaburi
• Chiang Mai (Chiang Mai and Fang Districts)2
• Mae Hong Son (Mae Hong Son District)...The following is a discussion of the results of a partial preliminary statistical analysis of a sample of about 1,100 of these workers with regard to their place of origin, time of arrival, income in the last 20 years, receipt of a minimum wage and their possession of a work permit.3 The analysis does not involve the estimation of population parameters and any consequent inferences about the nature of the population (though inferences about the population will be published later). Rather, the following is a statistical description of Burmese workers in Thailand, which we, argue is important given the paucity of reliable and credible work in this area.";"Wylie Bradford &amp; Alison Vicary";;Burma Economic Watch;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-08-2005;my;displacement;Land Conflicts;Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/42823;http://burmalibrary.org/docs3/BEWsurvey.pdf;;;;

The earthquake, an interplate event, caused by the subduction of Indo-Australian) plate beneath the Andaman (or Burma) microplate was the largest in size (Mw 9.1) in the world for the last 40 years. While the epicenter was located west off Sumatra Island, the aftershock zone extended through the Nicobar to the Andaman Islands. This earthquake generated a tsunami which devastated the shores of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, South India, and Thailand as far as the east coast of Africa. More than 200,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the tsunami. In Myanmar, however, the damage and casualties were relatively small compared to other countries that were impacted.This report summarizes the results of a survey to documents the effects of the tsunami along the Myanmar coast and seeks to identify why the damage was much smaller than the neighboring Thai coast, and how vulnerable the Myanmar coast may be for future tsunamis.;"Kenji Satake

and nongovernment—high degrees of autonomy. The recent government changes, including the
more civilian representation in parliament and its shift to engage with Western economies, raise
questions regarding the future of the military, as well as local autonomy and the rural peasantry’s
access to land. As increasing numbers of international investors are poised to enter the Myanmar
market, this article will revisit notions of land use and appropriation, and finally the role of the
army and its changing relationship with Waste Lands...

“Our government wishes to give back land to the rightful owners,” said Tun Win, referring to the smallholder farmers who still make up the bulk of Burma’s population. He was speaking to reporters from his office on Tuesday.

A legacy of land seizures by the former military government, in collaboration with crony companies, has in recent years been compounded by large-scale investments from neighboring countries, notably in extractive industries and energy production. Some of the more high-profile examples, such as the vast Letpadaung copper mine in Sagaing Division, operated jointly by Chinese company Wanbao and a Burmese military conglomerate, have been met by the sustained mobilization of dispossessed farmers claiming higher compensation or the return of their land.

OBL:62671;Land Grabbing in Dawei (Myanmar/Burma): a (Inter) National Human Rights Concern;;"Land grabbing is an urgent concern for people in Tanintharyi Division, and
ultimately one of national and international concern, as tens of thousands of people are being displaced
for the Dawei Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Dawei lies within Myanmar’s (Burma) southernmost
region, the Tanintharyi Division, which borders Mon State to the North, and Thailand to the East, on
territory that connects the Malay Peninsula with mainland Asia. This highly populated and prosperous
region is significant because of its ecologically-diversity and strategic position along the Andaman coast.
Since 2008 the area has been at risk of massive expulsion of people and unprecedented environmental
costs, when a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Thai and Myanmar governments,
followed by a MoU between Thai investor Italian-Thai Development Corporation (ITD) (see Box 1) and
Myanma Port Authority, granted ITD access to the Dawei region to build Asia’s newest regional hub.
Thai interest in Dawei is strategic for two reasons. First, the small city happens to be Bangkok’s
nearest gateway to the Andaman Sea, and ultimately to India and the Middle East. Second, the project
links with a broader regional development plan, strategically plugging into the Asian Development
Bank’s (ADB) East-West Economic Corridor, a massive transport and trade network connecting
Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam; the Southern Economic Corridor (connecting to Cambodia);
and the North-South Economic Corridor, with rail links to Kunming, China. If all goes as planned,

large petrochemical industrial complex, heavy industry zone, oil and gas industry, as well as medium
and light industries), and a road/pipeline/rail link that will extend 350 kilometers to Bangkok (via

OBL:62674;GUIDANCE NOTE ON DEVELOPING POLICY OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING LAND GRABBING AND SPECULATION IN MYANMAR JULY 2012;;"Land grabbing and speculation, which can both manifest in a multitude of forms, are
unfortunate, often-inter-twined, yet common practices in countries undergoing structural
political transition. If unchecked, unregulated, or unintentionally encouraged by the very
governments that replace formerly authoritarian regimes, these two land realities can serve to
undermine democratic reforms, entrench economic and political privilege and seriously harm
the human rights prospects of those affected, in particular internationally recognised housing,
land and property (HLP) rights. Land grabbing and speculation can increase inequality, harm
economic prospects and create conditions where social tensions and even violence may
become inevitable. Unless law and policy explicitly address the negative consequences of
these practices, land grabbing and speculation can erode citizen confidence in government,
reduce incomes and livelihoods and increase poverty and broad declines in a range of vital
social indicators.
And yet, there is nothing inevitable or inherent about the inequitable acquisition and control
of ever-larger quantities of land in fewer and fewer hands. Indeed, governments wishing to
protect the HLP rights of rural and urban dwellers and properly regulate the land acquisition
and transfer process can succeed in reducing the prevalence of both land grabbing and
speculation, improve the human rights prospects of current landholders and ultimately
strengthen both democratic processes and macro-economic perspectives.
It is clear that these issues are affecting Myanmar at the moment, and that it is up to the
Government to take steps to address these problems in a fair, effective and equitable manner

Salvation Army (ARSA), attacked approximately 30 security force outposts in northern Rakhine State.1 In its
response, the Myanmar Army, rather than targeting ARSA, launched an attack on the Rohingya population
in northern Rakhine State as a whole. Often working with Border Guard Police (BGP) and local vigilantes, the
military has carried out a campaign of violence that has been systematic, organized, and ruthless.
In this briefing, Amnesty International presents evidence that the Myanmar military has killed at least
hundreds of Rohingya women, men, and children; raped and perpetrated other forms of sexual violence on
Rohingya women and girls; and carried out organized, targeted burning of entire Rohingya villages. This
briefing builds on Amnesty International’s published findings since the crisis began, including on the
Myanmar military’s use of anti-personnel landmines. In seven weeks, the relentless human rights violations
have forced more than 520,000 Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. More cross the border daily.
The attack on the Rohingya population has been both systematic and widespread, constituting serious
human rights violations and crimes against humanity under international law (see text box below). The
violations and crimes have been committed within a context of decades of systematic, state-led
discrimination and persecution of the Rohingya population and occasional large-scale outbursts of violence.
After ARSA attacks on security force outposts in October 2016, the Myanmar military carried out “clearance
operations” marked by widespread and systematic human rights violations, including unlawful killings,
sexual violence and other forms of torture, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary arrests, which Amnesty
International concluded may have amounted to crimes against humanity. The current campaign is an
escalation, with the targeted burning of villages on a massive scale seemingly designed to push the Rohingya

Eh Mo Thaw and his family were herded into a relocation camp where they had to work for the Burma Army, digging ponds and growing rice to feed the Burmese troops. They had no time to grow food for themselves and many were not able to survive. Villagers caught foraging for vegetables outside the camp perimeter were shot on sight.

Eh Mo Thaw managed to escape from the camp with his family. For 20 years, he hid in the jungle, moving from place to place whenever Burmese troops drew near.

OBL:44303;Internal Displacement and Vulnerability in Eastern Burma;;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
""In September 2002 the Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC), formerly the
Burmese Border Consortium, compiled a report “Internally Displaced People and
Relocation Sites in Eastern Burma”. The report was written because although the
Royal Thai Government was reluctant to accept more refugees and believed repatriation
should occur as soon as conditions were judged suitable, new refugees were still
arriving in Thailand. Since most of the new arrivals reported that they had formerly
been living as internally displaced persons, TBBC considered that it was important to
understand what was happening in the border areas before any planning for repatriation
could begin.
Since that time, the nature and scale of internal displacement in eastern Burma has
been generally acknowledged, and humanitarian agencies based in Burma have been
increasingly requesting and gaining access to some border areas. In particular, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Myanmar has negotiated
roving access to a number of townships of ‘potential refugee return’. UNHCR Thailand
has also been engaging the Royal Thai Government, donors and non governmental
organisations (NGOs) in a conceptual planning exercise for the eventual repatriation
of the refugees.
Much of Eastern Burma is, however, still inaccessible to international observers from
inside the country and the initial steps being taken towards planning for repatriation
make it even more important to understand what is happening in these areas. This
report draws together the results of new surveys carried out by local community
organisations who collectively have broad access to the border areas.
Community organizations conducted field surveys across eastern Burma between April
and July 2004.1 Population estimates have been gathered from key informants in 36
significant townships and cross-checked with estimates from other local humanitarian
and human rights agencies wherever possible. Vulnerability indicators were also
developed from a multi-stage cluster survey of 6,070 people and 1,071 households
in 60 areas spread over six states and divisions. The sample population for this
quantitative survey was distributed between internally displaced persons in free-fire
areas, government relocation sites, ethnic ceasefire areas and mixed administration
areas.
Estimates recorded during this survey in 2004 indicate at least another 157,000
civilians have been displaced by war or human rights abuses since the end of 2002.
This includes people from at least 240 villages which have been documented
as completely destroyed, relocated or abandoned during the past two years. The
current status of villages forcibly relocated prior to 2002 has not been comprehensively
assessed, but attempts to return and re-establish more than 100 such villages
in Tenasserim Division have been documented as thwarted by further displacement.
Civilian displacement has continued at a high rate even though there has been a significant decrease in the number of villages forcibly relocated since the mid-late
1990s. This trend is indicative of the extent to which government troops had been
deployed and villages forcibly evicted prior to 2002. Since then, the military government
has been consolidating, rather than expanding, areas of control. High rates of civilian
displacement in areas where forced village relocations have decreased are attributed
to the harassment of people who had already deserted SPDC relocation sites to
attempt returning to their village or resettlement nearby. The total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced
or obliged to leave their homes and have not been able to return or resettle and
reintegrate into society as of late 2004 is estimated to be at least 526,000 people.
The population consists of 365,000 people in the temporary settlements of ceasefire
areas administered by ethnic nationalities, while 84,000 civilians are estimated to be
hiding from the military-government in free-fire areas and approximately 77,000
villagers still remain in designated relocation sites after having been forcibly evicted
from their homes. This represents a decrease since 2002 when 633,000 people were
estimated to be internally displaced in hiding sites, temporary shelters and relocation
sites. This decrease can be attributed to a mix of sustainable return or resettlement,
forced migration into the fringes of urban and rural communities, flight into refugee
and migrant populations in Thailand and methodological differences in data
collection. Speculation remains as to how many people on the fringes of rural and
urban communities have been obliged to leave their homes and are unable to resettle
and reintegrate, but whose status as internally displaced persons can not be verified. Indicators of vulnerability for the internally displaced population reflect a critical
situation. The survey found that more than half of internally displaced households
have been forced to work without compensation and have been extorted of cash or
property during the past year. While these and other human rights abuses were
widespread and a lack of protection was common in all areas, people in relocation
sites have reportedly been affected the most.
Livelihoods in free-fire areas are demonstrated as largely dependent on subsistenceoriented
slash and burn agriculture, yet still they are undermined by government
patrols searching for and destroying crops. Conversely, less households were
documented in relocation sites than elsewhere as being involved in any type of rice
farming, indicating a lack of access to land and greater restrictions on movement.
Yet the survey also found the highest rates of hunting and gathering were in densely
populated ceasefire areas, which is indicative of the livelihood constraints of
resettlement into these areas.
This report presents indicators which suggest there is a public health emergency
amongst internally displaced persons in eastern Burma. A third of households
surveyed had not been able to access any health services during the past year,
contributing to high mortality rates from infectious diseases which can be prevented
and treated, such as malaria. Child mortality and malnutrition rates are double Burma’s
national baseline rate and comparable to those recorded amongst internally displaced
populations in the Horn of Africa.
The population structure shows significantly more children dependent on a smaller
proportion of working age adults compared to official data sources for Burma. This
working age adult population consists of a high proportion of women representing
greater rates of mortality, economic migration, flight from abuse and military
conscription amongst young adult men. Low levels of access to durable shelter are
recorded and associated not only with limited protection from the climate but also
adverse impacts on health and human dignity. Similarly, low levels of educational
attainment are likely to restrict the capacity of internally displaced persons to cope
and recover from all of these aspects of vulnerability.
The surveys demonstrate that the problem of forced migration in Eastern Burma
remains large and complex and that internally displaced populations are extremely

OBL:44300;Enduring Hunger and Repression: : Food Scarcity, Internal Displacement, and the Continued Use of Forced Labour in Toungoo District;;"This report describes the current situation faced by rural Karen villagers in Toungoo District (known as Taw Oo in Karen). Toungoo District is the northernmost district of Karen State, sharing borders with Karenni (Kayah) State to the east, Pegu (Bago) Division to the west, and Shan State to the north. To the south Toungoo District shares borders with the Karen districts of Nyaunglebin (Kler Lweh Htoo) and Papun (Mutraw). The westernmost portion of the district bordering Pegu Division consists of the plains of the Sittaung River, which are heavily controlled by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) military junta which presently rules Burma. The rest of the district to the east is covered by steep and forested hills that are home to Karen villagers who live in small villages strewn across the hills. For years, the SPDC has endeavoured to extend its control through the hills, but their efforts thus far have been hampered by the continued armed resistance of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Within the areas that are strongly controlled by the SPDC, the villagers must live with constant demands for forced labour, food, and money from the SPDC battalions that are based in the area. Villages that do not comply with SPDC demands risk being relocated and burned. Many villages have been burned and their inhabitants forcibly relocated to sites where the SPDC may more easily control and exploit them. Those villagers who do not move to the relocation sites flee into the jungles where they live as internally displaced persons (IDPs). Several thousand villagers now live internally displaced in the mountains of Toungoo District. These villagers live in almost constant fear of SPDC Army units, and must run for their lives if they receive word that a column of soldiers is approaching. SPDC Army columns routinely shoot displaced villagers on sight. The villagers here continue to suffer severe human rights violations at the hands of the SPDC Army soldiers, including, but not limited to summary arrest, torture, forced labour, extortion, extrajudicial execution, and the systematic destruction of crops and food supplies.

Although a verbal ceasefire is in place between the Karen National Union (KNU) and the SPDC, not much has changed for the villagers in the district. KNLA and SPDC military units still occasionally clash. The SPDC has taken advantage of the ceasefire to move more troops into the area and to build new camps. These new camps and troops have meant that the villagers now have to do forced labour building the new camps and portering supplies up to the camps. There are also more troops and camps to demand food and money from the villagers. The many new camps have made it more difficult for internally displaced villagers work their fields or to go to find food...";;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;31-08-2004;en;"agricultural land management;food security;farmers;land governance;displacement;indigenous peoples;local community";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/44300;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2004/khrg0401a.html;;;;
OBL:47970;Operation Than L'Yet: Forced Displacement, Massacres and Forced Labour in Dooplaya District;;In January 2002 it appeared that the SPDC considered most of Dooplaya district of southern Karen State to be pacified and under their control. But then Light Infantry Division 88 was sent in and commenced Operation Than L'Yet, forcibly relocating as many as 60 villages by July. Villagers were rounded up and detained without food for days, or force-marched to Army-controlled relocation sites after their houses were burned. Village heads, women and children were tortured. People who tried to flee into the forests were shot on sight, including one brutal massacre of ten people, six of them children under 15. Over a thousand people fled into Thailand, and several thousand more are still trying. Another five thousand are in Army relocation camps, where they have been provided with nothing and are struggling to survive on rice gruel and whatever roots they can forage. Their movements are tightly controlled and they are being used as forced labour to build roads, bridges and Army camps which will help Division 88 to clamp down further on the district. They are also forced to work as porters for the Army columns which go out to loot and destroy even more villages. KHRG researchers expect a renewed onslaught after the rains end in October, when Division 88 will probably set out to hunt down those still in hiding and may extend the forced relocations to more areas.;;;Karen Human Rights Group;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;25-09-2002;en;"local community;displacement;indigenous peoples";"Land Conflicts;Land Stakeholders & Institutions;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";Access to Land & Tenure Security;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/47970;http://www.khrg.org/khrg2002/khrg02u5.html;;;;

to extract, process, and export the Shwe
gas - as well as oil trans-shipments from
Africa and the Middle East - is now well
underway. Local peoples are losing their land
and fishing grounds without finding new job
opportunities. Workers that have found lowpaying
temporary jobs are exploited and fired for
demanding basic rights. Women face unequal
wages, discrimination in the compensation
process, and vulnerabilities in the growing sex
industry around the project.
Resentment against the so-called Shwe Gas
Project is growing and communities are beginning
to stand up against abuses and exploitation.
Despite threats and risk of arrest, farmers and
local residents are sending complaints to local
authorities. Laborers are striking for better pay
and working conditions and women running
households are demanding electricity.
Burma’s military government is exporting massive world-class natural gas
reserves found off the country’s western coast, sacrificing the country’s future
economic security and dashing chances of electrification and job creation. The
“Shwe” offshore fields will produce trillions of cubic feet of natural gas that
could be used to spur economic and social development in one of the world’s
least developed nations. Instead it will be piped across the country to China,
fuelling abuses and conflict along its path.
Meanwhile active fighting has broken out between
armed resistance groups and government troops
in the area of the pipeline corridor in northern
Burma.
The Korean, Chinese and Indian companies
involved in this project are taking tremendous
risks with their reputations and investments.
Social tensions, armed conflict, human rights
abuses, and lack of project standards have
raised concerns in investor circles and caused at
least one pension fund to divest from the Korean

the gas fields.

OBL:66171;Displacement and Poverty in South East Burma/Myanmar - 2011 Survey - TBBC (English);;"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (extract): Poverty alleviation has been recognised by the new government as a strategic priority for human
development. While official figures estimate that a quarter of the nation live in poverty, this survey suggests
that almost two thirds of households in rural areas of South East Burma/Myanmar are unable to meet
their basic needs. Impoverishment is particularly severe in the conflict-affected townships of Kyaukgyi
and Shwegyin in Pegu/Bago Region and Thandaung in Karen/Kayin State. Comparative analysis with
household surveys conducted by the World Food Program suggest that that standards of living in rural
areas of the South East are similar to conditions in Northern Rakhine State and far worse than those
those reported from the central Dry Zone.

OBL:50424;Logging Burma's Frontier Forests;;"Lots of maps...Burma holds half of the remaining forest in mainland Southeast Asia. Having lost virtually all of their original forest cover, Burma's neighbors -- China, India, and Thailand -- rely increasingly on Burma as a source of timber. Most of the regional timber trade is illegal. (See The Regional Timber Trade in Southeast Asia.)

The rate of deforestation in Burma has more than doubled since the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), the military regime that rules the country, came to power in 1988. (See Timber Production in Burma and The State Law and Order Restoration Council.)

Increased deforestation is primarily due to a rapid growth in logging in Burma's border areas. Timber exports have helped pay for the regime's arms purchases and a doubling in the size of the army. (See Deforestation Rates in Burma.)

Seventeen of the 20 ethnic minority armies, many of which have been in insurrection since independence in 1948, have negotiated cease-fires with the regime, but not peace agreements. The current situation of ""no peace, no war"" has encouraged unbridled logging in some of the border areas. (See The Chinese-Burmese Border.)

Wasteful and destructive logging by the regime, some of the ethnic minorities, and foreign companies along the borders with China and Thailand has resulted in extensive deforestation that has caused massive soil erosion, sedimentation of rivers, increased flooding, and acute dry season water shortages in some areas. (See The Thai-Burmese Border.)

Satellite data show that forest clearing in Kachin State more than tripled between 1978-1989 and 1989-1996, and that logging is responsible for almost half the deforestation. Kachin State holds one of the region's last large tracts of relatively undisturbed forest. The rapid fragmentation of this forest, and the biodiversity conservation and watershed protection it provides, is of national and international concern. (See Kachin State: A Frontier Forest.)

Opinion is divided on whether the international community should engage the regime to support forest conservation in Burma. Only limited opportunities exist for the international community to provide effective support to local communities or to the Forest Department, or to engage the regime through Burma's signatory status to international agreements. (See The Role of the International Community and Community Forestry.)

Under current political circumstances, there is no scope for direct engagement by the international community. It is therefore recommended that an independent satellite-based forest monitoring system be established to report on the state of BurmaÃ¯Â¿Â½s forests, that environmental issues be included in the international dialogue about how to influence the regime, and that the international community take advantage of international agreements to request information from the regime about forest management and timber production...";;;World Resources Institute;Online Burma/Myanmar Library;30-11-1997;en;deforestation;"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";Land Use, Management & Investment;MMR;Reports & Research;http://burmalibrary.org/node/50424;http://archive.wri.org/publication_detail.cfm?pubid=2928;;;;

Due to high population and very low rainfall the area is very serious effected and sustainable agriculture is facing with problems of land degradation and desertification. For this it was found that Government is supporting for rehabilitation and reforestation.Second area need attention is the mangrove of Ayeyarwady Delta.
