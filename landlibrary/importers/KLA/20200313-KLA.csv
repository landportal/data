"kla:2723";"Righting The Wrongs: Historical Injustices and Land Reforms in Kenya";"";"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For historical reasons, Kenya inherited a highly skewed system of land ownership at independence in 1963. British colonialism in Kenya was not merely administrative. Rather, it was accompanied by massive and widespread land alienation for the benefit of settler agriculture. As a result the best agricultural land-the White Highlands and the adjacent rangelands were taken from the Africans, without compensation, and parceled out to white settlers. Colonial legislation was enacted to legalize this process. As a result, whole communities lost valuable land that they had occupied over generations.</p>";"";"Kenya Land Alliance";"Kenya Land Alliance";"Kenya Land Alliance";"2007-05-07";"en";"displacement;eviction;land;land administration;land conflicts;land dispute;land governance;land ownership;land policies;land reform;land rights;land tenure";"Land Conflicts;Land in Post-Conflict Settings";"KEN";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/download/righting-the-wrongs-historical-injustices-and-land-reforms-in-kenya/";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/download/righting-the-wrongs-historical-injustices-and-land-reforms-in-kenya/?wpdmdl=2723";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/righting-the-wrongs-historical-ijustices-and-land-reforms.png";"";"";"";"";""

The approval by the public of the Constitution at the referendum on August 4, 2010 and its promulgation on August 27, 2010 heralded a new dawn of governance in Kenya. Through its broad provisions, it is expected that it will spur social and economic development and secure the land rights of all Kenyans, by among others guaranteeing them ownership, control and access to natural resources. It is also expected to ensure their participation in decision-making processes. Significantly, it is also expected to introduce governance structures that are projected to improve Kenya‟s democracy. The many references to land, natural resources and environment within the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and the provisions carefully crafted to deal with these issues are clearly indicative of the very high value that Kenya attaches on the question of land and associated resources. The adoption of the Sessional Paper No. 3 of 2009 on National Land Policy attests to the same. And this is with very good reason. Land is indeed a critical resource for economic growth, social development, and poverty reduction. Thus, the terms on which land is held, used and transferred have important consequences for economic growth, the distribution of wealth, social cohesion and reduction of poverty.</p>";"";"Kenya Land Alliance";"Kenya Land Alliance";"Kenya Land Alliance";"2011-09-30";"en";"cadastres;capacity building;commons;customary tenure;equal rights;gender equity in access to land;indigenous lands;land access;land administration;land allocation;land contracts;land cover mapping;land governance;land improvement;land investments;land management;land ownership;land policies;land reform;land registration;land tenure systems;land use mapping;natural resources management;negotiated land reform;rural development;rural population;state property;sustainable land management;tenure security;women";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights;Land & Gender;Land & Investments;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/download/the-land-sector-non-state-actors-lsnsa/";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/download/the-land-sector-non-state-actors-lsnsa/?wpdmdl=2629";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.png";"";"";"";"";""

While some complain that the Commission did not complete its task per all its terms of reference, the land gurus are thrilled by the fact that the report makes many far reaching recommendations on the principles of formulating a National Land Policy Framework and the Constitutional Framework for Land Administration and Management. While reminding everyone of the numerous steps involved in the development of a National Land Policy, Kenya Land Alliance (KLA) notes that the release of the ‘Njonjo Commission’ report marks the crucial second stage of the National Land policy development process which involves debating of the report.</p>";"";"Kenya Land Alliance";"Kenya Land Alliance";"Kenya Land Alliance";"2000-09-01";"en";"land administration;land improvement;land management;land rights";"";"KEN";"Institutional & Promotional Materials;Policy Papers & Briefs;RARO508";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/download/a-critical-analysis-of-the-report-of-the-presidential-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-land-law-system-of-kenya-sampled-reactions/";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/download/a-critical-analysis-of-the-report-of-the-presidential-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-land-law-system-of-kenya-sampled-reactions/?wpdmdl=2766";"http://www.kenyalandalliance.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oland-update.png";"";"";"";"";""

The project embraces a multi-stakeholder approach in the envisioned dialogues/consultation to build a deeper understanding of the issues under consideration and in implementing project activities, within Narok County. Beyond the multi-stakeholder approach, the project is primarily focused on women and youth within indigenous peoples’ groups in the County. This is despite the passage of the 2019 Charcoal Rules and Regulations and existence of key regulatory institutions such as the Narok County
