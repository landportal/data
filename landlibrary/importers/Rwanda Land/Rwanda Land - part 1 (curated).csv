An Assessment of Land Use Planning in Rwanda;Ian Munt, Mireille Ikirezi;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Land use planning is critical to sustainable development in Rwanda, given the finite and irreplaceable nature of land. This assessment examines three dimensions of land use planning practice in Rwanda: a) the institutional and organizational framework for land use planning, b) the plan development process and implementation issues arising from the plan, and c) the capacity of organizations and individuals to implement the land use planning system. The assessment finds that while levels of awareness and understanding of land use planning amongst ordinary citizens are increasing, the efficiency of land use planning is challenged by limited capacity and a lack of coordination among government institutions. The assessment recommends that the Government of Rwanda: 1) nurture professional skills and knowledge around land use planning; 2) expand the scope of annual Land Week campaigns beyond land administration issues to also address land use planning; and, 3) harmonize existing legislation to ensure that planning terms and methods are consistent.

Rural Settlement in Rwanda: An assessment of land  management and livelihoods.;Thierry Hoza Ngoga;;"International Alert; USAID";Residential land in Rwanda is scarce due to hilly terrain, a high population and a focus on agricultural growth to address food security concerns. The situation worsened following the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, which led to extensive destruction of houses and infrastructure, leading to thousands of Rwandans becoming homeless. To address these concerns, the government embarked upon a resettlement programme to regroup people into planned residential areas, ‘imidugudu’, the aim of which is to provide improved quality of life for the population through the provision of basic needs. This study seeks to understand some of the issues faced by imidugudu residents. The study finds that local authorities and residents generally view the programme positively, but that residents have a strong sense of reliance on the government and other stakeholders to supply what is needed to improve livelihoods, rather than to take ownership for improving their own situations. In this regard, there is a need to encourage developing resilience and a more independent outlook among imidugudu residents.;http://www.rwandaland.org/images/pdf/Landuse/Rural%20Settlement%20in%20Rwanda%20v1.0%20-%20DIGITAL.PDF;2015/12;English;Rwanda;USAID;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 2;
Final Report: Land Use Consolidation and Crop Intensification in Rwanda;;National University of Rwanda;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;The Land Use Consolidation Act (LUC) was introduced in 2008 and is an important component of agricultural policy in Rwanda. As part of the Government of Rwanda’s broader Crop Intensification Program (CIP), LUC entails participating farmers consolidating aspects of their operations with neighboring farmers, while retaining individual ownership of their parcels. The rationale for LUC is that joining small plots together to farm as a single unit would deliver important economies of scale in agricultural production, resulting in improvements to efficiency and sustainability, which would in turn boost household well-being and promote greater equity. Despite the importance of LUC, research related to the program has been limited, and there is a wide range of sometimes contradictory perspectives on its impacts. This report aims to fill this gap and reconcile these divergent views by providing a thorough and detailed analysis of the realities, perceptions, and impacts of LUC/CIP on socioeconomic and environmental outcomes.;http://www.rwandaland.org/en/partner-products/item/download/81_8db93304387fe0061edb043decb7c69e;2014/01;English;Rwanda;Chemonics;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 3;

Farmers’ soil knowledge for effective participatory integrated watershed management in Rwanda: Toward soil-specific fertility management and farmers’ judgmental fertilizer use;N.P. Rushemuka, R.A. Bizoza R.A, J.G. Mowo, L. Bock;;Elsevier;"In the complex soilscape of Rwanda, failure to tailor soil fertility management technologies to specific soil types is the major constraint to their adoption. A study was undertaken to understand how scientists can introduce new soil-related technologies as part of the already functioning farmers’ soil knowledge (FSK) system and achieve soil-specific fertility management interventions. Farmer participatory research and biophysical diagnostic methods were used in Akavuguto watershed, southern Rwanda. Results from this study show that the FSK system is not only rational but also practical and consistent with the technical soil knowledge and has the potential of being user-friendly for local fertility experts, agronomists and extensionists compared to the international soil classification systems. The farmers’ rationality is demonstrated by a clear agreement between farmers’ cognitive soil knowledge and farmers’ soil-related practices. The farmers’ practices follow a clear coping strategy in a poor and complex biophysical environment. In the Akavuguto watershed case study, the mountains, with their Urubuye (Entisols), are limited by the slope gradient and stoniness; they are planted with trees. The upper hills, with their Urusenyi (Entisols) and Inombe (Ultisols), do not have major edaphic limitations; they are used for growing beans and sorghum, crops that are demanding but key in farmers’ food security strategy. The back slopes, with their Umuyugu/Mugugu (Oxisols), are limited by poor fertility status; they are used for growing cassava and sweet potato which are acid tolerant and less demanding. The valley bottoms, with their Nyiramugengeri (Histosols) and Ibumba (Ultisols), are limited by very strong acidity; they are used for growing sweet potatoes. It was concluded that understanding the biophysical environment in terms of land units and associated farmers’ soil types constitutes an appropriate entry point to achieve soil-specific and replicable fertility management technologies";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913003605 ;2013;English;Rwanda;Elsevier;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 5;
Manipulating the Rural Landscape: Villagisation and Income Generation in Rwanda ;Ann-Sofie Isaksson;;University of Gothenburg;The aim of the present paper is to investigate whether households relocated to government- built village settlements, as part of Rwanda’s Villagisation programme (‘Imidugudu’), diversify into non-farm income-generating activities to a greater extent than other rural households in Rwanda, and if so, to what extent the variation can be explained by differences in micro-level asset and meso-level access factors. Despite the programme objective to stimulate non-farm activity, the results of empirical estimations drawing on household and community-level data suggest that Imidugudu households differ surprisingly little from other rural households in terms of diversification into non-farm income sources. The slightly greater participation in non-farm income-generating activities observed among the Imidugudu households can be attributed to regional variation and household characteristics mattering for selection into the programme rather than to asset endowments and improved service access.;https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/25865/1/gupea_2077_25865_1.pdf ;2011/06;English;Rwanda;University of Gothenburg;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 6;
Large-Scale Land Deals and Local Livelihoods in Rwanda: The Bitter Fruit of a New Agrarian Model;An Ansoms;;African Studies Review;In a context of globalization and liberalization, Africa is increasingly confronted with the commercialization of its space. Various large-scale actors, including international private investors, investor states, and local entrepreneurs, are constantly seeking to expand their land holdings for the production of food crops or biofuels. This article presents two Rwandan case studies and analyzes how large-scale land acquisition by foreign and local elite players affects local livelihoods. It identifies broader agrarian and social changes taking place in Rwanda and Africa and provides suggestions as to how the tables might be turned in order to protect local livelihoods in the further evolution of Rwanda’s agriculture.;http://mtw160-198.ippl.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/african_studies_review/v056/56.3.ansoms.pdf;2013/12;English;Rwanda;African Studies Review;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 7;
"Land Use Consolidation in Rwanda:
A Case Study of Nyanza District, Southern Province";Alfred R.Bizoza, Jean Marie Havugimana;;Science Target;The study assessed the adoption of land use consolidation and its determinants in Nyanza District of Southern Province, Rwanda. Land use consolidation is part of the on-going crop intensification program led by the Ministry of Agriculture in Rwanda. The extent to which this policy has been adopted is less spatially known. In addition, there is scarce knowledge about the factors affecting the adoption of this policy at household level. A sample of 132 households was randomly selected for the interviews conducted in August 2010. The analysis focused on farm, household, and institutional factors to investigate how these determine household’s decision to adopt land use consolidation. The findings show that gender, family size, trust, distance, cropping/farming practices are important determinants of a farmer’s decision to adopt land use consolidation in Nyanza District, Southern Rwanda.;http://www.rwandaland.org/images/Alfred%20Bizoza%20and%20Havugimana%20on%20Land%20Use%20Consolidation%202013.pdf;2013;English;Rwanda;National University of Rwanda;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 8;
Multitemporal LANDSAT Imagery Analysis to Study the Dynamics of Land Cover over Lake Kivu Region;Bikash Basnet, Anthony Vodacek;;Rochester Institute of Technology;In this study, maximum likelihood supervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied to cloud-free Landsat mosaic scenes formed for three years, 1987, 2001 and 2010, to map land cover changes in the Lake Kivu region in Central Africa. A supervised classification was carried out on the stacked vector of six reflective bands and two vegetation index images for the three years individually with the aid of ground data. Since ground data was not available for 1987, visual interpretation was used to aid supervised classification. The overall seven-class classification accuracies averaged to 77% for the three years. Post-classification change detection technique was used to evaluate land cover change statistics in the region using cross-tabulation. Changes among different land cover classes were accessed. A very severe land cover change has taken place in the region over the past 25 years as a result of human migration and agriculture practices. The major land cover changes in the area include rapid deforestation, urbanization and cropland expansion.;http://www.earsel.org/SIG/timeseries/2012mykonos/pdf/proceedings/proceedings_015.pdf;2012/05;English;Rwanda;Rochester Institute of Technology;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 9;
Emerging in a Changing Climate – Sustainable Land Use Management in Rwanda;Mathew Warnest, Bahrain, Didier G. Sagashya, Emmanuel Nkurunziza;;International Federation of Surveyors (FIG);"Durban COP17 December 2011 (UNFCCC 2011). The World held its breath for a global commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to steady human-induced climate change. During the proceedings, one unique country, Rwanda, set fourth its ambitious national strategy for charting a green growth and climate resilient future.
The mountainous central African nation of Rwanda (refer map 2009) is one of the World’s least developed countries with one of the highest population densities, and is notably one of the lowest emitters of Green House Gases (GHGs). Rwanda is an early mover in tackling its economy’s exposure to external oil prices and commodity market fluctuations at a time its development and investment growth is expanding. Rwanda’s appetite for greater access to energy, resources and land is rapidly increasing at full crescendo.
To achieve Rwanda’s ambitions, to transform to a prosperous, food secure, knowledge based economy, the Government has embarked on a low carbon development path that works to address renewable energy access and use, resource efficiency and climate resilience. Central to this strategy is optimal use of land. Rwanda’s land size is just 26,338 sq km for a population of 11 million increasing at nearly 2.8 per cent per annum. Urbanisation is increasing at 4.4 per cent, and agricultural production contributes more than 36.7 per cent of export earnings. Pressure on land is extremely high.
Key to Rwanda’s success, the landlocked and populous nation is rapidly establishing an integrated approach to planning its urban and rural environments, finalising land tenure reforms, and improving land information systems to support these activities. This paper brings to light Rwanda’s national green growth and climate resilience strategy. It provides a glimpse into Rwanda’s broad achievements in sustainable land use management that are regional and African continent best practice, and provides lessons of guidance for other emerging nations setting upon a course of low carbon development and climate change resilience. Readers are encouraged to explore the national strategy and supporting sector working papers from which this paper draws.";http://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2012/papers/ts07f/TS07F_warnest_sagashya_et_al_5991.pdf;2012/05;English;Rwanda;FIG;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 10;
Farm Land Use Consolidation in Rwanda: Assessment from the perspective of the Agriculture Sector;Arumugam Kathiresan;;Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Resources, and Forestry;Food crop production in Rwanda is predominantly dependent on the productivity in small- and fragmented farms. Raising productivity levels in smallholder farms therefore represents a vital means to economic growth and poverty reduction in Rwanda. Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) has embarked on a simplified land use consolidation model whereby farmers in a given area grow the priority food crops  in a synchronized fashion while keeping their land rights intact. Although consolidation is voluntary, it is a pre requisite for availing the benefits such as subsidized inputs under Crop Intensification Program (CIP), a revolutionary flagship program promoting food production. This report evaluates the progress, implementation and impacts of land use consolidation on food crop production, and draws insights on matching the strengths with opportunities and converting weaknesses to strengths.;https://www.google.rw/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjClpXS6cXOAhXEVRoKHeUwDFgQFggaMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minagri.gov.rw%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_upload%2Fdocuments%2Fagridocs%2FFarm_Land_Use_Consolidation_in_Rwanda.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEk20xWlvEdsGIJCjqk8eoaZBmSJQ&sig2=NRwg5hlLozMZd_bKftBXxA;2012/06;English;Rwanda;Government of Rwanda;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 11;
Linking Vulnerability, Land and Livelihoods: Literature Review;Tsegaye Moreda;;International Institute of Social Studies;"This chapter accomplishes several purposes, in which it shares the reader the theoretical orientation and empirical evidences of numerous studies that are closely related to the issues being raised in this study. It deals with the review of theoretical and empirical literature mainly related to rural poverty and livelihoods. In doing so, the chapter intentionally includes discussions on a wider scale to look at pertinent literature from many sub-Saharan African countries and beyond that have some resonance to better understand and relate the Ethiopian case to the wider literature.
The chapter begins with the discussion of the backgrounds on the persistence of poverty and food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa followed by subsequent general discussions on the link between agriculture and poverty reduction drawing evidence from some case studies across the developing world. Basically, the chapter is organized in two main sections each with subsections. The first main section reviews the main arguments and the available empirical evidence in the debate over the role of agriculture in economic growth and poverty reduction specifically whether smallholder agriculture in particular can provide a viable means to reduce poverty and persisting livelihoods insecurity in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Then it continues to discuss the challenges mainly the political economy of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, and provides an overview on linking land and livelihoods in the region as land continues to occupy at the centre of rural livelihoods.
The second main section presents the Ethiopian case. It is organized in four subsections. The first one outlines the issues of land, vulnerability and livelihoods. Here, emphasis has been placed to the agricultural sector since agriculture and agriculture related activities largely provide the means of living for the vast majority of rural households. The second subsection looks at and reflects on the links between land degradation, land tenure and livelihoods. It examines the effect of land tenure on land degradation and its implications to livelihoods as well as the implication of land scarcity on rural livelihoods drawing from evidence documented by other research undertaken over various parts of the country. The third considers the literature on livelihood diversification followed by discussions on migration issues. The final part of the chapter presents a short conclusion.
It is worth noting that this chapter indeed deserves a special attention because it provides a framework for relating this present study to the larger ongoing dialogue in the literature, identifying gaps and extending existing studies. In addition, it will provide a benchmark for comparing the results of this particular study with the other existing findings.";http://www.iss.nl/fileadmin/ASSETS/iss/Documents/PhD_Abstracts_and_theses/SAMPLE_CHAPTER.pdf;2012/02;English;Rwanda;International Institute of Social Studies;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 12;
The Impact of Land Lease Fee on Landowners: Rwanda Case Study;Eluis Mbemba Mbinda, James Daale, Annie Kairaba;;Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development ;The majority of rural Rwandans are dependent on land for their livelihoods. Recognizing the critical nature of land to peace, stability, and economic development, Rwanda began implementing the Land Tenure Regularisation Process (LTRP) in 2008. While the Rwanda government has made highly commendable efforts in implementing the LTRP, some challenges have been faced, including a challenge whereby landowners only came to learn about the requirement of paying land lease at the time of collecting the Ownership Documents. Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development  made a decision to launch a quick study that would establish the facts on the ground, by providing evidence based data to policy makers, local leaders and the population through reliable data and public awareness. This study was conducted as an effort to gauge the accuracy and legitimacy of people?s concerns in relation to the impact of land taxation on their livelihood. The main study findings revealed that, most popular concerns are based on lack of proper information for both the population and responsible personnel for land registration.;http://www.Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development rwanda.org/IMG/pdf/THE_IMPACT_OF_LAND_LEASE_FEE_ON_LANDOWNERS_.pdf;2012/02;English;Rwanda;Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development ;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 13;

"Farmers, Institutions and Land Conservation
Institutional Economic Analysis of Bench Terraces in The Highlands of Rwanda";Alfred R. Bizoza;;Wageningen School of Social Sciences;"This study consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 sets the stage of the thesis in terms of problem statement, theoretical perspective, objectives and research questions, the research area and data collection procedure, and ends with this outline. Chapter 2 will provide an account of soil erosion against the background of the environmental discourses that have emerged over time in Rwanda. Chapter 3 will discuss how farmers perceive their participation, the role of their organizations and institutions in soil and water conservation in Northern and Southern Rwanda.
Chapter 4 will focus on the financial profitability and technical effectiveness of established bench terraces in the research area, while Chapters 5 and 6 are concerned with the adoption of bench and progressive terraces in the study area. Thanks to information obtained from farmers during the survey, the impact(s) of various local institutions on the adoption of these terrace structures is estimated in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 will ‘unpack’ the adoption process of bench terraces to estimate current and future adoption upon farmers’ capacity to invest in existing and new terraces. Finally, Chapter 7 will provides some major conclusions and policy and research options for future generation of soil and water conservation in Rwanda.

Environmental and Gender Impacts of Land Tenure Regularization in Africa;Daniel Ayalew Ali, Klaus Deininger, Markus Goldsteir;;World Bank Group;"Although increased global demand for  land has led to renewed interest in African land tenure, few
 models to address these issues quickly and at the required  scale have been identified or evaluated. The case of  Rwanda's nation-wide and relatively low-cost land  tenure regularization program is thus of great interest.  This paper evaluates the short-term impact (some 2.5 years  after completion) of the pilots undertaken to fine-tune the  approach using a geographic discontinuity design with  spatial fixed effects. Three key findings emerge from the analysis. First, the program improved land access for legally married women (about 76 percent of married couples) and prompted better recordation of inheritance rights without gender bias. Second, the analysis finds a very large impact on investment and maintenance of soil conservation measures. This effect was particularly pronounced for female
 headed households, suggesting that this group had suffered
 from high levels of tenure insecurity, which the program
 managed to reduce. Third, land market activity declined,
 allowing rejection of the hypothesis that the program caused
 a wave of distress sales or widespread landlessness by
 vulnerable people. Implications for program design and
 policy are discussed.";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3527/WPS5765.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y;2011/08;English;Rwanda;World Bank Group;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 16;
Land Issues in the Rwanda’s Post-Conflict Law Reform.;Geoffrey Payne;;Pretoria University Law press;"Rwanda is a small, landlocked country with an area of 26,338 square kilometres, only 52% of which is used or developed. The country has a population of nearly ten million people, with a population growth rate of 3.1% and a high urbanisation rate of 8% a year. The average population density for the country as a whole has been estimated at 330 persons per km in 2002, making it one of the highest density levels in Africa. This stimulates a high demand for housing, especially in urban areas where 25,000 new dwelling units are said to be needed annually. Land is used intensively, and, while a formal market is expanding, most land continues to be held under customary tenure.
In Rwanda, the existence of the Napoleonic Civil Code offered formal legal titles, but these were only available in the towns and cities and in effect they were available only to those who made substantial investments in the land. This right was not accessible to the majority of ordinary Rwandans; with only 1% of the land registered, almost all of Rwanda’s land is still held under customary or local tenure. Successive waves of violence between 1959 and 1994 have weakened these informal structures. Population pressure, land scarcity and economic development are now increasing the demand for and hence the value of land. An active informal market in land has arisen to meet that demand. Customary tenure, such as it is, is no longer enough. As a result, all citizens are increasingly demanding access to formal systems to register their rights in land.1
In 2003, Government started a long process of consultation on land tenure. That revealed broad support for land tenure reform and led to the drafting of the National Land Policy (2004) and the enactment of the Organic Land Law (OLL) in 2005. In 2006, the Ministry of Land, Environment, Forestry, Water and Natural Resources (MINITERRE) carried out detailed field consultations in rural, urban and suburban settings. This was followed in 2007 by field trials that tested formal tenure regularisation procedures and processes that would lead to simple registration of land. These procedures were implemented by locally appointed committees and technicians to see how the population would respond to formal systems and what the practical difficulties would be in its implementation. The trials also served to ensure all of the issues were properly tested to inform the legal and institutional development process.2 After the successful trial of land registration, the Government of Rwanda introduced a roll out of land tenure regularisation countrywide and this programme is supposed to be completed within three years (2013). The sections below analyse this programme and how land related legislation is implemented. It also discusses the likely consequences and policy implications of the programme.";http://www.pulp.up.ac.za/pdf/2011_16/2011_16.pdf;2011;English;Rwanda;Pretoria University Law Press;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 17;
Socio Economic Impact of Commercial Exploitation of Rwandan Marshes : A Case Study of Sugar Production in Rural Kigali;Muriel Veldman, Marco Lankhorst;;International Land Coalition (ILC);"In 2005 the Government, aiming to encourage more intensive forms of agriculture to supply new markets, passed a land law which brought all marshes and river valleys under State control. In 1997 the State leased 3,100 hectares of land in the Nyacyonga and Nyabarongo marshes outside the capital Kigali to a Ugandan-based enterprise, the Madhvani Group, which also acquired control over the country’s sole sugar mill. Most of the local people who had previously exploited the marshland experienced its takeover by the company as a dispossession. Around 1,100 farmers remain as outgrowers; most cultivate less than one hectare each. Many local people, especially women, have become labourers, working either for Madhvani or for the outgrowers. A small portion of the local population has benefited, but the majority feel impoverished. This study indicates that if a local population is largely dependent on an incoming investor for securing their livelihoods, but they have few enforceable rights to bargain with, the chances that they will benefit from the investment are reduced.";http://www.rcn-ong.be/IMG/pdf/RCN-ILC_Rwanda.pdf;2011;English;Rwanda;International Land Coalition (ILC);Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 18;
Practical Tools on Land Management - GPS, Mapping and GIS:  Rwanda;;Rwanda Environmental Management Authority;Rwanda Environment Management Authority;"Sustainable land management best practices on integrated approaches to natural resources management covers all the major rural land use systems including agriculture, rangeland, and forestry. Environmental sustainability and sustainable livelihoods can be achieved only through a holistic approach in which different resource users and decision makers come together to agree on common objectives that also maintain the ecological integrity of the resource base.In Rwanda, farmers integrate both crop and livestock operations. Recognizing that the two are highly complementary biologically and economically, promotion of sustainable management of rangelands along with sustainable agriculture are beneficial.
Agricultural activities in the face of the high demographic pressure on limited land resources has resulted into land fragmentation, reduction of farm sizes and continued intensive cultivation of land with no fallow subjecting land to alarming soil erosion. The land policy and land law discourages land fragmentation and minimum allowed farm size is 1 ha. It promotes long-term land security that would promote investment in long-term infrastructure viable commercial ventures in agricultural sector. It also provides opportunities for gradual farm consolidation and increasing farm size and encouraging those who are capable to go into farming business. If the land policy and land law continues to be implemented slowly, its foregoing benefits can not be realized.
The concept of sustainable forest management recognizes the connections among the health of forests, communities, the economy, and the environment. Sustainable forest management
4
implies viewing the forest as an integrated whole rather than as the source of any one economic product or service (for example, timber or climate regulator). Sustainable forest management respects and integrates the full range of forest environmental, social, and economic values. The introduction and strengthening of sustainable forest management schemes, includes meaningful participation and benefit sharing by forest users, clear and respected tenure and use rights, sustainable market chain, development and implementation of forest management plans, and reforestation. Rwandan national policies and strategies provide a framework for increased efforts, including the development and strengthening of institutions and programs for forest management, protection, and sustainable development.
Issues surrounding land-use and planning need to be addressed. In Rwanda, the subject of land ownership and use is surrounded by imprecision, an imprecision reflected in the available cartography and data. Land can be located and registered in both graphical and attribute terms starting from a situation with almost no data is available. Land ownership in both public and private sectors forms the basis for development. Most disputes in general stem from legal claims to parcels of land. Constitutional provisions and new policies on land can help governments implement effective land reform programs.
Application of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and mapping tools to land related projects is now a widespread phenomenon. The advantages have proven substantial in improving access to information. The use of high, but robust, technology such as GPS technology and mapping tools provides more simplification, increased efficiency, less cost, and sufficient accuracy. For such policies to be effective, it is important to embrace advancement in technology. Technologies such as GPS and mapping models are valuable decision-making tool for land managers. These technologies are advantageous because they are easy to use.";http://www.rema.gov.rw/rema_doc/Environmental%20Managemnent%20Plractical%20Tools/2-%20Practical%20Tools%20on%20Land%20Management%20-%20GPS,%20Mapping%20and%20GIS%20_Final%20Version_%2017-07-2010.pdf;2010;English;Rwanda;Rwanda Environment Management Authority;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 19;
GIS Model for the Land Use and Development Master Plan in Rwanda;Willem Tims;;University of Gävle;This thesis was aimed at the development of a Geographical Information System (GIS) based model to support the Rwanda Land Use and Development Master Plan. Developing sustainable land management is the main task of this master plan. Stakeholder’s involvement was of key importance. Their demands should be analysed and visualised to support discussions and the decision-making process. Spatial Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a proven method for land-use planning purposes. However, most land-use planning applications focus on a specific theme, such as urban development. In addition, land-use planning is often limited to a relatively small area. This thesis focused at the development of a countrywide GIS model, containing all land-uses accommodated in three main land-use categories: urban, agriculture and conservation. The GIS model was largely based on the Land-Use Conflict Identification Strategy (LUCIS) model. Many of the goals, objectives, and subobjectives that described the earlier mentioned land-use categories were adopted from the original model. However, a significant number of them were dropped, and new were created to suit the Rwandan situation. Stakeholder’s involvement was realized by assigning weights to the goals and preference maps. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used as weighting method. ESRI’s ArcGIS ModelBuilder was used to give the model shape in the GIS. Firstly, suitability maps were created of all elements in the model. The suitability maps were then transformed into preference maps by weighting them. In the next step the preference maps were collapsed in three classes: low, medium and high preference. Finally, the preference maps of the three land-use categories were combined, in order to visualize conflict areas. Ortho photos proved to be useful when acting as reference for the suitability and preference maps. Despite a large number of missing datasets, the GIS model was executed to simplify the understanding. However, many of the obtained results were unreliable because of the incompleteness of datasets, and can therefore not be used for decision-making.  Unfortunately, due to the stage of the project it was not possible to obtain weights from the stakeholders, and should therefore be done when the time is right. Right Choice DSS, a very user-friendly decision support application, was proposed to use for calculating weights. To conclude, the developed GIS model integrated countrywide land-use suitability mapping and stakeholders’ wishes that can be used for discussions and decision making.;http://hig.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:227842/FULLTEXT01.pdf;2009/06;English;Rwanda;University of Gävle;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 20;
Strategic Road Map for Land Tenure Reform in Rwanda;;Rwandan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources;Rwandan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources;Government of Rwanda has set out its long and medium term objectives for economic development and poverty reduction in its Vision 2020 and its Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). A wide ranging reform of land tenure and land management forms a central part of Rwanda’s strategy to meet those objectives. To realise these objectives, the Ministry has developed a Strategic Road Map for Land Tenure Reform as a framework for implementation of the National Land Policy and the Organic Law determining the use and the management of land in Rwanda.;http://rnra.rw/index.php?id=47&tx_armfiledownload_file%5Barmfiles%5D=StrategicRoadMapforLandTenure_Reform.pdf&tx_armfiledownload_file%5Baction%5D=download&tx_armfiledownload_file%5Bcontroller%5D=Armfiles&cHash=f88b1ee4ca23211cff503f9c60d37856;2009/04;English;Rwanda;Government of Rwanda;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 21;
Land, Business and Human Rights ;;Institute for Human Rights and Business;Institute for Human Rights and Business;"This is the first of a series of consultations on the human rights challenges and dilemmas involved in the acquisition and use of land – held individually or collectively - for private or state-owned business and economic purposes. The aim of the series of consultations is to develop a framework that leads to an end of human rights abuses at any stage of the process – before acquisition, during acquisition, and after operations have commenced and, if necessary, relocation and rehabilitation arranged, and compensation paid.
This requires strengthening and enforcing the existing legal mechanisms; identifying situations in which the land acquisition should not take place; highlighting gaps in administration of laws, practices, and policies; and recommending a framework that businesses should follow as part of their land acquisition process.
The purpose of this paper is to inform and stimulate discussion for the human rights and land roundtable. Some of the questions being raised are meant to provoke a robust discussion, and there is no pre-determined outcome.
The Institute aims to organise up to three more consultations of this nature, in different cities, over the next 15 months. Possible locations include Bogota, Colombia; Lagos, Nigeria; and London, UK.

Land Issues in International Human Rights Law;Elizabeth Wickeri, Anil Kalhan;;Institute for Human Rights and Business;"Up to one quarter of the world’s population is estimated to be landless, including 200 million people living in rural areas,1 and approximately 75% of the world’s population living in extreme poverty (less than $1/day) live in rural areas.2 According to the Food and Agriculture Agency of the United Nations (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)), “rural landlessness is often the best predictor of poverty and hunger.”3 “While not the only pathway out of poverty, ample evidence suggests that access to land is effective in helping rural households generate higher incomes” through the sale of crops and the money saved when the family feeds itself from the land.4 Yet, even though “land constitutes the main asset from which the rural poor are able to derive a livelihood . . . . [m]illions of families, though they toil on the land, do not enjoy ownership rights over it and are considered landless.”5
The condition of landlessness threatens the enjoyment of a number of fundamental human rights. Access to land is important for development and poverty reduction, but also often necessary for access to numerous economic, social and cultural rights, and as a gateway for many civil and political rights. However, there is no right to land codified in international human rights law.
Land is a cross-cutting issue, and is not simply a resource for one human right in the international legal framework. And yet, while rights have been established in the international legal framework that relate to land access for particular groups (e.g. indigenous people and, to a more limited extent, women), numerous rights are affected by access to land (e.g., housing, food, water, work), and general principles in international law provide protections that relate to access to land (e.g., equality and nondiscrimination in ownership and inheritance), an explicit consideration of the legal implications of access to land for a broad range of human rights is necessary.";http://www.ihrb.org/pdf/Land_Rights_Issues_in_International_HRL.pdf;2009;English;Global; Institute for Human Rights and Business;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 23;

Regional Differences regarding Land Tenancy in Rural Rwanda, with Special Reference to Sharecropping in a Coffee Production Area;Shinichi Takeuchi, Jean Marie Marara;;Institute of Developing Economies;"This paper examines land tenancy systems and tenant contracts in Rwanda, with respect to socioeconomic contexts. Our research in southern and eastern Rwanda produced data suggesting that land borrowing with xed rents has been generally practiced, and that rent levels have been low in comparison to expected revenues from eld production. In the western areas of coffee production, however, the practice of sharecropping has recently appeared. This system is advantageous to landowners, as they are able to acquire half of the harvests; in addition, the xed rent levels in this region are much higher than those of other regions. In the southern and eastern regions, because land borrowing with xed rents has been the only tenancy pattern and rent levels have remained low, the economic situation should be interpreted in the context of a continuing traditional Rwandan land tenure system. In contrast, in the western coffee production area, the soaring of xed rents and the emergence of sharecropping have been brought about by high pressures for land use, which were caused not only by a population increase but also by the development of cash crop production and the existence of a labor exchange system. The increase in rent levels has therefore been offset by a corresponding increase in agricultural productivity.";http://www.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_suppl/abstracts/pdf/ASM_s35/5TAKEUCHI.pdf;2007/03;English;Rwanda;Institute of Developing Economies;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 25;

The Urgency of Land and Agrarian Reform in Rwanda;Saskia Van Hoyweghen;;Oxford University Press;The challenges which lie ahead for post-genocide Rwanda's economic, social and political development are closely related through the issue of land. The pressure from a high rate of population growth, added to the paucity of economic opportunities outside the agricultural sector, is forcing people off the land and into poverty. Society is under extreme stress. Over the last decade the fabric of Rwandan society has been torn, resulting in ethnic and social divisions which culminpted in the events of 1994. Since then, new groups have entered the competition for land. Decisions concerning land and agrarian reform will unavoidably benefit some groups within this fragmented society while disadvantaging others. This article approaches the land problem from two perspectives: first, by situating its socio-economic dimension in a deeper historical context and second, by considering it as a specifically contemporary socio-political problem. The article discusses the latest proposals for land and agrarian reform. While pressure on land has, over time, weakened social bonds, it remains doubtful whether the government has the political strength—in the present unstable national and regional political climate—to carry out the necessary reinforcement of communal bonds which economic development appears to require.;http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/392/353.abstract.%20;1999;English;Rwanda;Oxford University Press;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 31;
Land Use, Soil Loss and Sustainable Agriculture in Rwanda;Dan Clay, Laurence A. Lewis;;Human Ecology;The conservation of scarce land resources is essential to the long-term viability of agriculture in Rwanda. High population density, steep slopes, and abundant rainfall prevail in the highland portions of this African country, making the task of erosion control uncommonly difficult for the peasant farmer. The specific use to which land is put, e.g., cultivation, fallow, pasture, woodlots, and, if it is cultivated, the particular combination of crops grown, can be seen as contributing to both the cause and the solution of the land degradation problem. Based on data from a nationwide survey of over 4800 agricultural fields in Rwanda, this study reviews the extent to which the land use and cropping patterns employed by farmers are appropriately suited, in terms of erosion control, to the topographical and environmental characteristics of their landholdings. Analyses of other aspects of the traditional agricultural system, e.g., variations in relative soil fertility, the use of organic fertilizers, and the location of fields relative to the household, are introduced to help explain why farmers often fail to maximize erosion control through land use and cropping practices. Adjustments to current land use practices that can be expected to reduce soil loss are discussed.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00889179;1990/06;English;Rwanda;Human Ecology;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 32;
Policies on Population, Land Use, and Environment in Rwanda;John. F. May;;Population and Environment;The paper first describes the interactions between population growth, land use, and environment in Rwanda, a small, densely populated landlocked nation in the East-African Great Lakes region. These interactions are modelled using a conceptual framework applied to the neighboring Kivu region in Zaire, but adapted to the Rwandan case study. Second, the paper contends that the emphasis put on increasing agricultural production, mostly through the use of marginal land, as well as the lack of a timely implementation of a family planning program and a national population policy, have led to a worsening of the interactions between population growth, land use, and environment. In an attempt to demonstrate this hypothesis, demography-driven projection scenarios are applied to the agricultural colonization and intensification processes.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02208117?LI=true.%20;1995/03;English;Rwanda;Population and Environment;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 33;
Indigenous Land Rights Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Constraint on Productivity?;Shem Migot-Adholla, Peter Hazell, Benoit Blarel, Frank Place;;World Bank Group Economic Review;This article uses cross-sectional evidence from Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda in 1987–88 to examine the question, Are indigenous land rights systems in Sub-Saharan Africa a constraint on productivity? The evidence supports the hypothesis suggested by historical studies, that African indigenous land rights systems have spontaneously evolved from systems of communal control towards individualized rights in response to increases in commercialization and population pressure. Cross-sectional data on the incidence of land improvements and on land yields provide little support for the view that limitations under indigenous law on the right to transfer land are a constraint on productivity.;http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/155.abstract.%20;1991;English;Sub- Saharan Africa;The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/THE World Bank Group;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 34;

Farm size, land fragmentation, and economic efficiency in Southern Africa;Bizimana C, Nieuwoudt W.L, Ferrer S.R.D.;;National University of Rwanda;"Butare, where this study was conducted, exhibits one of the highest population densities in Rwanda. As a direct result of population growth, most peasants have small fields and land fragmentation is common. The purpose of this article is to examine the effect of land fragmentation on economic efficiency. Regression analysis shows that area operated is primarily determined by the population-land ratio, non- agricultural employment opportunities, ownership certainty and adequate information through agricultural training. Results from a block-recursive regression analysis indicate that the level of net farm income per hectare, which indirectly reflects greater economic efficiency, is determined by the area operated, use of farm information, field extension staff visits, formal education of a farm operator, and the fragmentation of land holdings. Economies of size are evident in the data. The results obtained using ridge regression support the findings of two-stage least squares. Policies should be implemented to improve the functioning of land rental markets in order to reduce land fragmentation, improve rural education and access to relevant information; and strengthen extension facilities to individual farmers.";http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/9489/1/43020244.pdf;2004/06;English;Rwanda;National University of Rwanda;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 36;
Agricultural Intensification in Rwanda. An elusive goal  fertilizer use  and conservation investments ;Kelly, Mpyisi, Shingiro, Nyarwaya;;Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Resources, and Forestry;"Prior to the 1994 war, Rwanda had one of the best agricultural data bases on the African continent with a consistent time series on production, area, and yield data spanning the period from 1984 through 1992. This data base, drawn from annual surveys of a nationally representative random sample of approximately 1,240 farm households, was supplemented with a variety of specialized surveys conducted intermittently on topics such as input use, livestock production, natural resource management practices, non-farm income, etc. A key finding of these pre-war studies was that yields of most crops declined from 1984 through1991. 
Objectives. The objectives of this policy brief are to (1) describe the post-war situation concerning production practices, comparing the post-war situation (when possible) to the pre- war situation, and (2) discuss the implications of the findings for the design of programs and policies to promote agricultural intensification through the use of improved inputs and conservation practices.";http://fsg.afre.msu.edu/rwanda/agintensification.pdf;2001/01;English;Rwanda;Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Resources, and Forestry;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 37;
Land Use consolidation A  Home grown  solution for food security in Rwanda ;Mbonigaba Muhinda, Leonidas Dusengemungu;;Rwanda Agriculture Board;Rwanda’s economy is largely agrarian. More than 80% of the Rwanda’s projected population of 10.5 million1 depends on farming. The total land area of the country measures 24,700 square kilometers. Although about 79% of the country’s land is classified as agricultural, only 11% of the land represents permanent crop land2. The remaining agricultural lands are covered with forests, marshlands and marginal lands in the hillsides where permanent and routine cultivation of crops are not tenable. Of the total arable land of 2,294,380 ha, 1,735,025 ha is cultivated with food and cash crops3 and the remaining represents pastures and bushes.;http://rpfinkotanyi.org/en/IMG/pdf/Farm_Land_Use_Consolidation_in_Rwanda.pdf;2011;English;Rwanda;Rwanda Agriculture Board;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 38;

Rwanda State of the environment report : Chap 3 Land use and agriculture;;Rwanda Environmental Management Authority;Rwanda Environmental Management Authority;"The agricultural sector has been given a high priority in the government’s planning for development. The current national thrust is for the sector to move from subsistence to commercial mode of production. This strategy aims to increase household incomes and lead to a 50 per cent reduction in poverty over twenty years (ROR 2008). With its projected contribution to economic growth, modernisation of agriculture is seen as one of the six pillars of Vision 2020 along with sustainable land-use management and basic infrastructure (ROR 2000). Agriculture is also explicitly recognised in the EDPRS as one of the four priority sectors that will both stimulate economic expansion and make the greatest contribution to poverty reduction (ROR 2007). The other sectors are health, education and road maintenance

The economics of farm fragmentation:  evidence from Ghana and Rwanda;Benoit Blarel, Peter Hazell, Frank Place, John Quiggin ;;World Bank Group Economic Review;Farm fragmentation, in which a household operates more than one separate parcel of land, is a common phenomenon in Sub-Saharan Africa. Concerned by the perceived costs of fragmented as opposed to consolidated holdings, several countries have implemented land consolidation programs. But these interventions overlook the benefits that land fragmentation can offer farmers in managing risk, in overcoming seasonal labor bottlenecks, and in better matching soil types with necessary food crops. This article uses household data from Ghana and Rwanda to discuss the incidence and causes of fragmentation. It then formally tests the relation between fragmentation and land productivity and risk reduction. The conclusion is that consolidation programs are unlikely to lead to significant increases in land productivity and may actually make farmers worse off. Policymakers should focus instead on reducing the root causes of fragmentation: inefficiencies in land, labor, credit, and food markets.;http://oag.sagepub.com/content/30/4/281.full.pdf;1992;English;Ghana, Rwanda;The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/THE World Bank Group;Land Use;Land Use, Management & Investment;;land use;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 41;

Understanding Informal Urban Land Market Functioning in Peri-urban Areas of Secondary Towns of Rwanda: Case Study of Tumba Sector, Butare Town ;Emmanuel Twarabamenye;;National University of Rwanda;Since mid-1970s, a great number of rural-urban migrants are converging towards Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, and secondary towns, putting strain on land, especially of urban fringes. This is the case of Tumba Sector, a suburb of Butare Town, which attracts many people searching land for various uses. The purpose of  this paper is to analyse the land market process  in Tumba Sector.  Data used in this paper were collected through desk study, survey and from non-structured interview held with the Tumba Land Bureau Officer. Findings revealed land-owned was acquired through informal purchase and land sellers were mainly native people who acquired land through inheritance. Size of land to be sold is frequently fixed unilaterally by the seller. Land demarcation is done with indigenous plants. Land price is negotiable and varies greatly based on the land size and its specific location and is higher than the reference land price. Land right transfer is evidenced by a simple “sale contract”. All informal land purchases are not reported to the Land Bureau though the process is very easy, clear and cheap. Land buyers are primarily local tradespeople, and secondarily civil servants. Great involvement of tradespeople in land purchase and high price suggest that there is land speculation in the area. Though informal land market benefits to the land seller and the buyer, it can be detrimental the client. Informal land market develops as a response to the failure of formal land provision which leads people not to apply to Huye District/Tumba Sector for land provision. Therefore it is important for the District and the Sector be empowered to be land provider and enforce rules and the law governing land, especially in peri-urban areas.;http://www.rwoj.ur.ac.rw/index.php/lifesciences/article/view/60;2012;English;Rwanda;National University of Rwanda;Land Market;;;land markets, land investments;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 46;
The Impact of Land Lease Fee on Landowners: Rwanda Case Study;Eluis Mbemba Mbinda, James Daale, Annie Kairaba;;Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development ;The majority of rural Rwandans are dependent on land for their livelihoods. Recognizing the critical nature of land to peace, stability, and economic development, Rwanda began implementing the Land Tenure Regularisation Process (LTRP) in 2008. While the Rwanda government has made highly commendable efforts in implementing the LTRP, some challenges have been faced, including a challenge whereby landowners only came to learn about the requirement of paying land lease at the time of collecting the Ownership Documents. Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development  made a decision to launch a quick study that would establish the facts on the ground, by providing evidence based data to policy makers, local leaders and the population through reliable data and public awareness. This study was conducted as an effort to gauge the accuracy and legitimacy of people?s concerns in relation to the impact of land taxation on their livelihood.

[m]illions of families, though they toil on the land, do not enjoy ownership rights over it and are considered landless.”5
The condition of landlessness threatens the enjoyment of a number of fundamental human rights. Access to land is important for development and poverty reduction, but also often necessary for access to numerous economic, social and cultural rights, and as a gateway for many civil and political rights. However, there is no right to land codified in international human rights law.
Land is a cross-cutting issue, and is not simply a resource for one human right in the international legal framework. And yet, while rights have been established in the international legal framework that relate to land access for particular groups (e.g. indigenous people and, to a more limited extent, women), numerous rights are affected by access to land (e.g., housing, food, water, work), and general principles in international law provide protections that relate to access to land (e.g., equality and nondiscrimination in ownership and inheritance), an explicit consideration of the legal implications of access to land for a broad range of human rights is necessary.";http://www.ihrb.org/pdf/Land_Rights_Issues_in_International_HRL.pdf;2012;English;Rwanda;Institute for Human Rights and Business;Land Market;;;land markets, land investments;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 48;
Promoting Social Inclusion in Urban Areas: Policies and Practices;Alain Durand-Lasserve;;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France;"According to recent UN estimates, 924 million people - nearly one out of three urban dwellers – were living in slums in 2004. Of these, 874 million are from low and middle-income countries (Millennium Project, 2005). Urban poverty as a proportion of total poverty is clearly increasing: 43% of the population of developing cities are living in slums (28% in North Africa, 71% in sub-
1
Saharan Africa, 42% in Asia and 32% in Latin America) (Lopez Moreno, 2003 and UN-Habitat, 2003 b). By 2020, this figure is expected to increase to 1.5 to 1.7 billion, depending on estimates. Recent estimates (Cohen, 2004) suggest that about 2.8 billion will need housing and urban services by 2030. The slum population is expected to increase from 32% of the world population in 2001, to about 41% in 2030.
So far, no satisfactory solution for addressing the challenge of slums has been found. Conventional responses are usually based on the combination of three main types of intervention: (i) in situ upgrading in existing informal settlements; (ii) evictions followed by resettlement on serviced sites on the periphery of cities; (iii) the preventive provision of low-cost serviced plots for housing (UN-Habitat, 2003 b). These responses have achieved limited results. Despite some major successes at national level where political will and continuity, economic development and mobilization of resources in sufficient quantities have made possible the implementation at national level of innovative policies for housing the poor (South Africa, Brazil, Tunisia, etc.), scaling up remains a major problem. Most slum policies are simply treating the symptoms and cannot be considered as structural and sustainable policies. The Millennium Development Goal is to achieve a significant improvement in the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020 (Millennium Project, 2005).

LAND Project Policy Brief: Implementation of the Expropriation Law in Rwanda ;Mireille Ikirezi, Dr. Fidele Masengo, Anna Knox;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"This policy brief aims to inform policy and current practices governing land expropriation in Rwanda drawing on recent research carried out by the LAND Project. The brief elaborates on the legal framework and procedures guiding expropriation and on reported practice based on information gathered from primary and secondary sources. It then proposes measures that would potentially strengthen implementation of expropriation exercises countrywide.
In drafting this policy brief, the authors examined laws and policies governing expropriation, reviewed relevant literature and articles in the media, and interviewed key informant interviews from government institutions and civil society organizations (CSOs). Key informants1 were selected based on their knowledge of and involvement in expropriation issues.
Following this introduction, Section 1 presents legal definitions of expropriation and discusses the history land expropriation in Rwanda, including factors that led to the drafting and promulgation of law and policies that have influenced the practice of expropriation. In Section 2, we elaborate on domestic policies and laws as well as international legal instruments to which Rwanda is signatory that guide how expropriation is implemented. We examine in depth Law no 18/2007 relating to expropriation in the public interest and the different organs involved in expropriation.
In Section 3, we highlight factors driving expropriation in Rwanda and issues emanating from the implementation of expropriation of Rwanda, particularly in urban zones. Drawing on information reported by key informants, the media, and published papers; we examine the practice of expropriation and the outcomes experienced by those who have been expropriated. In the fourth section, we policy and other recommendations based on lessons learned from expropriation exercises in Rwanda and analysis of how they can be improved to facilitate more favorable outcomes.";http://www.rwandaland.org/en/products-for-land/item/125-implementation-of-the-expropriation-law-in-rwanda;2015/05;English;Rwanda;Chemonics;Displacement, Resettlement & Restitution;"Access to Land & Tenure Security; Land Policy & Legislation";;displacement, security of tenure (land), eviction, expropriation, compensation;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 52;
Socio Economic Impact of Commercial Exploitation of Rwandan Marshes : A Case Study of Sugar Production in Rural Kigali;Muriel Veldman, Marco Lankhorst  ;;International Land Coalition (ILC);"In 2005 the Government, aiming to encourage more intensive forms of agriculture to supply new markets, passed a land law which brought all marshes and river valleys under State control. In 1997 the State leased 3,100 hectares of land in the Nyacyonga and Nyabarongo marshes outside the capital Kigali to a Ugandan-based enterprise, the Madhvani Group, which also acquired control over the country’s sole sugar mill. Most of the local people who had previously exploited the marshland experienced its takeover by the company as a dispossession. Around 1,100 farmers remain as outgrowers; most cultivate less than one hectare each. Many local people, especially women, have become labourers, working either for Madhvani or for the outgrowers. A small portion of the local population has benefited, but the majority feel impoverished. This study indicates that if a local population is largely dependent on an incoming investor for securing their livelihoods, but they have few enforceable rights to bargain with, the chances that they will benefit from the investment are reduced.";http://www.rcn-ong.be/IMG/pdf/RCN-ILC_Rwanda.pdf;2011;English;Rwanda;International Land Coalition (ILC);Displacement, Resettlement & Restitution;"Access to Land & Tenure Security; Land Policy & Legislation";;displacement, security of tenure (land), eviction, expropriation, compensation;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 53;
Drawing a line under the crisis: Reconciling returnee land access and security in post-conflict Rwanda;John Wu Bruce;;Overseas Development Institute;"This report is part of a broader comparative effort by the Overseas Development Institute’s Humanitarian Policy Group on Land Tenure in Conflict and Post- Conflict Situations, which aims to inform and improve the policy and practice of humanitarian action and to inform related areas of international policy. It seeks to understand how land issues affect and are affected by violence and conflict resolution, what responses are appropriate and what lessons can be learned from specific contexts of land tenure interventions, both during and after conflict.
ODI selected Rwanda for one of the country studies because, as the project document suggests:
The experience of civil strife in Rwanda presents a stark example of the link between access to land and the precipitation of conflict ... It also provides an example of a situation where refugee and IDP resettlement, land claims and land reform were major features of the post- conflict setting.
As the author worked with colleagues in Rwanda, two other important dimensions of the Rwandan experience became clear. Refugee return and land access in Rwanda has been an extraordinarily complex matter, with some refugees leaving just in time for others returning to take up their homes and lands. Rwanda has important lessons to teach us about the need to maintain flexibility in dealing with complexity, and raises questions about whether obviously well-meant but very specific requirements in international conventions can be applied with full rigour in all cases. In addition, the Rwandan experience highlights the fact that conflict and post- conflict are not two ends of a simple spectrum, but overlap. Refugee return and economic reconstruction similarly overlap, and this creates challenges in framing policy and legal responses that address adequately the diverse claims and needs that arise.";https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/4174.pdf;2007/06;English;Rwanda;Overseas Development Institute;Displacement, Resettlement & Restitution;"Access to Land & Tenure Security; Land Policy & Legislation";;displacement, security of tenure (land), eviction, expropriation, compensation;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 54;

Emergency and Development: the Case of Imidugudu, Villagisation in Rwanda;Dorothea Hilhorst, Mathijs Van Leeuwen;;Journal of Refugee Studies;To accommodate the needs of hundreds of thousands of returnees after war and fgenocide in 1994, the new Rwandan Government launched a settlement programme, Imidugudu. Since early 1997, this programme has targeted the entire rural population: all scattered households in the country had to be regrouped in villages. What started as a response to an emergency turned into an ambitious but controversial development programme. The programme has been implemented with support from international organizations, including UNHCR and numerous NGOs. This paper shows that an emergency discourse was central in their considerations to give their support. Secondly, it considers local processes of implementation. Two case studies make clear that as of now, little has been achieved of the envisaged interated approach to settlement, land use and livelihoods.

Land Scarcity, Distribution and  Conflict in Rwanda;Jean Bigagaza, Carolyne Abong, Cecile Mukarubuga;;African Centre for Technology Studies;This chapter examines the relationship between land scarcity and conflict in Rwanda. Historically, land pressure has been a severe problem in Rwanda, where over 90% of the population practises agriculture. Land pressure has resulted in declining overall agricultural production, but increasing production for individuals and groups with favourable land and resource access. Cultivation is encroaching into wetlands, national parks and forest reserve areas to satisfy unmet demands for land by some, predominately underprivileged, groups. Large numbers of internally displaced persons have worsened stress in some ecologically sensitive areas, such as in forests, resulting in localised degradation of forest resources. ;https://s3.amazonaws.com/Landesa - Rural Development Institute_production/resource/2176/Bigagaza_Chapter2-Scacrity-and-surfeit_2002.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA&Expires=1471356614&Signature=%2BKhKT8Mq4AhZewpLzE0KkoplJ6U%3D;2004;English;Rwanda;;Land distribution;;;land distribution;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 59;
Problématique du Régime Foncier au Rwanda: Contexte et Perspectives, Relations avec l’Habitat Regroupé;Nkusi Juvénal;;Conseil de concertation des organisations d'appui aux initiatives de Base;"Le retour des réfugiés de 1959, la politique de regroupement de l'habitat adoptée en 1996, la disette qui frappe le pays depuis 1999, la faible pluviosité qui prévaut dans le pays depuis deux ans après le phénomène el nino, conduisent à une prise de conscience nouvelle de ce qu'il faut appeler la question foncière, de ses relations avec la production agricole dans le cadre de l'option de sécurité alimentaire. Les conditions dans lesquelles la problématique foncière s'est progressivement imposée dans les analyses et préoccupations des acteurs de développement expliquent sans doute les tergiversations et les complexités d'approche, les hésitations multiples et surtout l'absence d'une circonscription précise du problème. Le droit à la terre pour les réfugiés est inscrit dans la Loi Fondamentale, principalement dans le Protocole sur le retour des réfugiés; l'Etat a l'obligation de leur trouver et de leur donner des terrains. Les exigences d'une production agricole sous la forme intensive, commerciale et spécialisée, la prédominance de la propriété familiale, la fébrilité du statut juridique de la terre en droit écrit et coutumier rendent encore difficile l'identification des filières propres à déterminer les voies de solution du problème.
Les analyses faites cherchent à isoler la question foncière du contexte socio- économique dans lequel il s'inscrit; par la suite les solutions et les propositions restent cantonnées dans des perspectives étroitement sectorielles et visent à agir sur les situations foncières, notamment les mécanismes générateurs de ces situations, symptômes de formes et de niveaux de développement dépendant et de structures sociales inégalitaires. La complication de ce problème devient de ce fait un indicateur de pauvreté et sa prise en compte, ajoutée à son intégration dans l'ensemble des perspectives de développement économique définit sans équivoque la volonté de modernisation et d'adaptation au contexte global. Longtemps oublié ou ignoré, le problème foncier est un nœud important d'insertion de l'économie rurale dans l'ensemble de l'économie nationale monétarisée.";https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/5932/3185.pdf?sequence=1;2005/05;Français;Rwanda;Conseil de concertation des organisations d'appui aux initiatives de Base;Land distribution;;;land distribution;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 60;
The Urgency of Land and Agrarian Reform in Rwanda;Saskia Van Hoyweghen;;African Affairs;The challenges which lie ahead for post-genocide Rwanda's economic, social and political development are closely related through the issue of land. The pressure from a high rate of population growth, added to the paucity of economic opportunities outside the agricultural sector, is forcing people off the land and into poverty. Society is under extreme stress. Over the last decade the fabric of Rwandan society has been torn, resulting in ethnic and social divisions which culminpted in the events of 1994. Since then, new groups have entered the competition for land. Decisions concerning land and agrarian reform will unavoidably benefit some groups within this fragmented society while disadvantaging others. This article approaches the land problem from two perspectives: first, by situating its socio-economic dimension in a deeper historical context and second, by considering it as a specifically contemporary socio-political problem. The article discusses the latest proposals for land and agrarian reform. While pressure on land has, over time, weakened social bonds, it remains doubtful whether the government has the political strength—in the present unstable national and regional political climate—to carry out the necessary reinforcement of communal bonds which economic development appears to require.;http://africa.wisc.edu/rwandagpa/_documents/articles_development/VANHOYWEGHEN_Urgency-of-land.pdf;1999;English;Rwanda;Oxford University Press;Land distribution;;;land distribution;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 61;

Land Tenure under Unendurable Stress: Rwanda Caught  in the Malthusian Trap;Catherine André, Jean-Philippe Platteau;;Centre of Research in the Economics of Development;This paper reports the findings of an in-depth case study of a highly densely populated area in the Northwest of Rwanda which has been conducted during the period 1988-1993. It demonstrates that acute competition for land in a context characterized by too slow expansion of non-agricultural income opportunities has resulted in increasingly unequal land distribution and rapid processes of land dispossession through both operation of the (illegal) land market and evolution of indigenous tenure arrangements. It is also shown that pervasive incidence of land disputes and the threat of landlessness have led to rising tensions in social relations and even within the core of family li&, thus paving the way for more and more overt expressions of disharmony and violence. A connection between these ominous conditions and the civil rear that broke out in 1994 is established.;https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/5453/2744.pdf?...1;1996/01;English;Rwanda;Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix;Land distribution;;;land distribution;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 63;

Leave None to Claim the Land: A Malthusian Catastrophe in Rwanda;Marijke Verpoorten;;LICOS Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance;"More than 200 years after its Örst publication, the Malthusian thesis is still much debated, albeit in a modiÖed form. Rather than predicting a global catastrophe, most neo-Malthusians stress the local character of the relationship between population pressure, natural resource scarcity, and conáict as well as its dependency on the socio-political and economic context. This softened version of Malthusíthesis has received little empirical support in cross-country studies. In contrast, a number of sub-national analyses have provided some evidence for local conditional Malthusian catastrophes, although ""catastrophe"" is a big word since these studies have largely focused on low-intensity violence. This article adds to the small body of sub-national studies, but focuses on a high-intensity conáict, the Rwandan genocide. In particular, it provides a meso-level analysis of the relation between population pressure and the intensity of violence measured by the death toll among the Tutsi across 1,294 small administrative units. The results indicate that the death toll was signiÖcantly higher in localities with both high population density and little opportunity for young men to acquire land. On the one hand, this Önding can be interpreted as support for the neo-Malthusian thesis. On the other hand, it is possible that another mechanism played, i.e. in densely populated areas it may have been relatively easy for the elite to mobi- lize the population, because of dependency relations through the land and labor market. Alternatively, in densely populated areas, there may have been more lootable assets, and the violence may have been opportunistic rather than driven by need or by fear.";http://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/dp291.pdf;2011/08;English;Rwanda;LICOS Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 66;
Fonctionnement des comités de conciliateurs (ABUNZI) au Rwanda: Perceptions, Observation et Analyse;;RCN Justice & Démocratie;RCN Justice & Démocratie;"RCN Justice & Démocratie monitored the activities of the Mediation Committees (Komite y’Abunzi) in Rwanda for eighteen months from 2009 to 2011 and presents in this report its main findings and analysis. Such feed?back from the field enables the formulation of recommendations which aim to improve and reinforce the Abunzi’s performance.
Capitalizing on a vibrant tradition and knowledge of conflict mediation in Rwanda, the Rwandan government institutionalized the Mediation Committees for the first time in 2004. To date, Rwanda has 2150 Mediation Committees active at cell level (one per entity) and 416 Mediation Committees at Sector level. According to the law, Committees must first seek to mediate between the parties in conflict; where this is not possible, the mediators must take a decision which can be enforced if one of the parties refuses to comply with it. Cell?level and Sector?level Mediation Committees constitute pre?juRwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development ictional conflict resolution institutions. They aim to provide the citizens a quick and free of charge access to justice and accordingly reduce the case load of the Primary Courts.
RCN Justice & Démocratie evaluated the perceptions of over 500 individuals and 80 citizens’ groups on the practices of the mediators, observed more than 150 mediation hearings, and interviewed several Abunzi, Executive secretaries (cell or sector level) and judges. The analysis focused on four main aspects of the Mediation Committees’ proceedings:
1. Context of the hearings: Our study revealed that the mediators generally commence the hearing of a case less than a month after it has been presented to them. Litigants are usually allowed to choose one of the three selected mediators. Explanations given by the mediators at the beginning of the hearing are in most cases incomplete.
2. Quality of the mediators’ performance: According to our study, only a minority of the mediators take an active part in the questioning. Abunzi tend to limit to a minimum the number of field visits they make as part of their investigation, a fact negatively perceived by the litigants. In 25% of the cases, public participation is not properly considered; parties and their witnesses are listened to unequally depending on their influence and socio?economic status within the community.
3. Mediators’ favoured approach: In only a little more than half of the cases do the mediators seek to mediate between the parties. Hence, disputes are settled by the means of mediation only one time in four. ‘Mediated’ parties believed more in the durability of the resolution. Yet, in 2011 (Repeat Baseline Study) still 58% of the respondents indicated a preference for the workings of the Primary Courts; the judges’ professionalism, mastering of modern laws and impartiality were recognized. In turn, Mediation committees were preferred to engaging local authorities. At the same time, knowledge of the local context is a necessity, according to the respondents.
4. Closing of the hearings: In over half of the cases where a decision is taken more mediators than the three appointed for the case take part in the deliberation. Decisions are not necessarily explained and justified to the participants. 25% of the interviewees complained to be given the minutes of the decision too late to file an appeal; some mediators illegally request from the parties different kinds of ‘compensation’. 81% of the parties who were declared ‘losers’ intended to appeal the Abunzi’s decision. However, statistics show that since appellate Mediation Committees were established at the Sectors’ level in June 2010, very few unresolved disputes reach the Primary Courts. The duration of some disputes in the overall process constitutes a real concern where citizens submit their cases to several successive and overlapping mediating institutions with no satisfying outcomes.";http://www.rcn-ong.be/IMG/pdf/310112_VOUT_RCN-J_D-Rapp-Monit-Abunzi-_pdf-2.pdf;2011/09;Français;Rwanda;RCN Justice & Démocratie;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 67;
Land Issues in the Rwanda’s Post-Conflict Law Reform;Geoffrey Payne;;Pretoria University Law Press;"Rwanda is a small, landlocked country with an area of 26,338 square kilometres, only 52% of which is used or developed. The country has a population of nearly ten million people, with a population growth rate of 3.1% and a high urbanisation rate of 8% a year. The average population density for the country as a whole has been estimated at 330 persons per km in 2002, making it one of the highest density levels in Africa. This stimulates a high demand for housing, especially in urban areas where 25,000 new dwelling units are said to be needed annually. Land is used intensively, and, while a formal market is expanding, most land continues to be held under customary tenure.
In Rwanda, the existence of the Napoleonic Civil Code offered formal legal titles, but these were only available in the towns and cities and in effect they were available only to those who made substantial investments in the land. This right was not accessible to the majority of ordinary Rwandans; with only 1% of the land registered, almost all of Rwanda’s land is still held under customary or local tenure. Successive waves of violence between 1959 and 1994 have weakened these informal structures. Population pressure, land scarcity and economic development are now increasing the demand for and hence the value of land. An active informal market in land has arisen to meet that demand. Customary tenure, such as it is, is no longer enough. As a result, all citizens are increasingly demanding access to formal systems to register their rights in land. In 2003, Government started a long process of consultation on land tenure. That revealed broad support for land tenure reform and led to the drafting of the National Land Policy (2004) and the enactment of the Organic Land Law (OLL) in 2005. In 2006, the Ministry of Land, Environment, Forestry, Water and Natural Resources (MINITERRE) carried out detailed field consultations in rural, urban and suburban settings. This was followed in 2007 by field trials that tested formal tenure regularisation procedures and processes that would lead to simple registration of land. These procedures were implemented by locally appointed committees and technicians to see how the population would respond to formal systems and what the practical difficulties would be in its implementation. The trials also served to ensure all of the issues were properly tested to inform the legal and institutional development process.2 After the successful trial of land registration, the Government of Rwanda introduced a roll out of land tenure regularisation countrywide and this programme is supposed to be completed within three years (2013). The sections below analyse this programme and how land related legislation is implemented. It also discusses the likely consequences and policy implications of the programme.";http://www.pulp.up.ac.za/pdf/2011_16/2011_16.pdf;2011;English;Rwanda;The World Bank Group;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 68;
The Abunzi Mediation in Rwanda: the Opportunity for Engaging with Traditional Institutions for Conflict Resolution;Martha Mutisi;;African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes;This Policy & Practice Brief analyses the role of traditional institutions for conflict resolution, paying special attention to their relevance in post-conflict societies. Using Rwanda’s abunzi mediation system as an example, the brief considers traditional African mechanisms for conflict resolution as unique, context-specific, and responsive to the justice needs of societies emerging from conflict. The brief draws attention to synergies between the modern and the traditional by highlighting how traditional institutions have sometimes complemented the state, which is often too overwhelmed and under-resourced to be able to offer timely and effective justice. The abunzi mediation is part of the Rwandan justice system, whose restorative approach helps people to address their conflicts without resorting to litigation and other retributive approaches. While acknowledging these benefits, the brief also highlights some challenges of the abunzi system, and particularly cautions against too much state oversight in community-driven conflict resolution processes. For true local ownership of justice, the brief advocates diminished state interference in the affairs and processes of the abunzi. The brief further makes recommendations on how to enhance the functionality and relevance of abunzi to the present day realities of the post-conflict state of Rwanda.;http://www.accord.org.za/publication/the-abunzi-mediation-in-rwanda/;2011/11;English;Rwanda;African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 69;
La proximité de la justice : Rapport Socio-Juridique sur les Mode de Gestion de Conflits Foncier  ;Marco Lankhorst, Muriel Veldman;;RCN Justice & Démocratie;This study evaluates the level of access to justice and the quality of the justice rendered in Rwandese land dispute resolution and marks pathways to improvements in the benefits that those seeking justice may derive from the system. The analytical concept of proximity of justice provides the organising principle for our study and the present report. This notion distinguishes four different dimensions in which the level of access to and quality of justice can be measured: (1) timeliness (of decisions and the delays within which they can be enforced), distance (the geographical distance that has to be covered in seeking justice), (3) understanding (the extent to which those seeking justice understand the procedures followed and the decisions rendered), and (4) trust (the extent to which procedures and decisions correspond to their notions of justice and fairness, and are thus seen as legitimate). The focus in this report is on the quality of land dispute resolution in rural areas (as opposed to the cities), and specifically on the interventions of lower level administrative units, abunzi committees (somewhat akin to justices of the peace) and lower courts (tribunaux de base). This is because these institutions deal with and bring to an end the vast majority of land disputes that arise in the rural context.;http://www.rcn-ong.be/IMG/pdf/RW_tude_conflits_fonciers_2010_02.pdf;2009/06;Français;Global;RCN Justice & Démocratie;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 70;
Drawing a line under the crisis: Reconciling returnee land access and security in post-conflict Rwanda;John Wu Bruce;;Overseas Development Institute;"This report is part of a broader comparative effort by the Overseas Development Institute’s Humanitarian Policy Group on Land Tenure in Conflict and Post- Conflict Situations, which aims to inform and improve the policy and practice of humanitarian action and to inform related areas of international policy. It seeks to understand how land issues affect and are affected by violence and conflict resolution, what responses are appropriate and what lessons can be learned from specific contexts of land tenure interventions, both during and after conflict.
ODI selected Rwanda for one of the country studies because, as the project document suggests:
The experience of civil strife in Rwanda presents a stark example of the link between access to land and the precipitation of conflict ... It also provides an example of a situation where refugee and IDP resettlement, land claims and land reform were major features of the post- conflict setting.
As the author worked with colleagues in Rwanda, two other important dimensions of the Rwandan experience became clear. Refugee return and land access in Rwanda has been an extraordinarily complex matter, with some refugees leaving just in time for others returning to take up their homes and lands. Rwanda has important lessons to teach us about the need to maintain flexibility in dealing with complexity, and raises questions about whether obviously well-meant but very specific requirements in international conventions can be applied with full rigour in all cases. In addition, the Rwandan experience highlights the fact that conflict and post- conflict are not two ends of a simple spectrum, but overlap. Refugee return and economic reconstruction similarly overlap, and this creates challenges in framing policy and legal responses that address adequately the diverse claims and needs that arise.";https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/4174.pdf;2007/06;English;Rwanda;Overseas Development Institute;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 71;
A Thousand Hills for 9 Million People: Land Reform in Rwanda: Restoration of Feudal Order or Genuine Transformation?;Kathrin Wyss;;swisspeace;More than eleven years after the 1994 genocide, Rwanda might be an internally pacified, but by far not unified nation. There are different factors, which threaten the fragile social equilibrium. The issue of land is one of them. Land has long been a scarce and disputed resource in Rwanda. Ongoing shortages due to decreasing soil quality, growing population pressure and unequal distribution, as well as a lack of income generating alternatives beyond agriculture create an extremely precarious future to the national economy of the small, landlocked country. An all-embracing land reform based on a new land law and land policy is intended to remedy this situation. The main focus is on privatization and commercialization of land property. Yet, ongoing discrimination in the distribution of land, the growing concentration of large plots in the hands of political cronies as well as a tendency towards historical revisionism, raise doubts about the government’s true intentions. This impression becomes even more pertinent in relation to the de facto exclusion of civil society from the drafting process of the new land law and policy. Moreover – or as a result – neither the policy nor the law adequately guarantees the protection of the interests of large parts of the rural population. Local non-governmental stakeholders thus fear a further marginalization of discriminated groups and/or the establishment of a system following pre-colonial feudal rule. Today’s increasing disagreements over land property should be a warning sign that such a development would be anything but favorable to Rwanda’s reconciliation and the establishment of long-term peace in the country.;https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/4923/4029.pdf?sequence=1;2006/01;English;Rwanda;swisspeace;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 72;
Women’s Land Rights in Rwanda: How can they be protected and strengthened as the Land Law is implemented;Jennifer Brown and Justine Uvuza;;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;"The Landesa - Rural Development Institute (RDI) has been working on behalf of USAID on land law and policy issues in Rwanda since 2003. The main objective of this assistance has been to provide technical assistance to MINITERE on the drafting of laws and regulations to implement the Land Law. In order to help inform our technical assistance and to gain a better understanding of gender and land issues, RDI funded a short round of research on women’s land rights in April 2006. The costs of the research were greatly subsidized by USAID because the research was conducted as part of a trip that was otherwise funded by USAID. This research was conducted jointly by RDI staff attorney Jennifer Brown and Maître Justine Uvuza, a Rwandan lawyer who currently consults on gender and human rights and who formerly worked in the Ministry of Gender. This report describes their findings.
This research had several objectives. First, to directly inform the provision of RDI’s technical assistance in drafting the forthcoming complementary legislation and regulations to the Land Law. Second, to determine future needs, including more detailed research, policy discussion, possible legal amendments, and public education that may be needed to ensure that the Land Law is implemented in a gender sensitive manner. Third, to build a stronger dialogue between those creating land policy in Rwanda and Rwandan women. Finally, the study will also add to the broader corpus of information about women’s access and rights to land in Africa.
The keystone of this research was a series of focus group interviews with women in Butare, Kibungo, and Ruhengeri. In each location, groups of roughly 10-12 women were brought together to answer questions and discuss the present status of women’s land rights in Rwanda. The women participants were identified by a local contact and were selected to represent a wide rage of opinion and experience. Interviewees included young women, married women, separated women, women in polygamous relationships, widows, and orphans. They included both poor and middle class women, as well as women who grew up in Rwanda and those who returned to Rwanda after the genocide. In each case the women were asked a series of questions about their personal land rights and also about the typical land rights for women in their area. While a checklist of questions guided our discussion to ensure that major topics were covered with every group, the interviews were kept flexible to encourage the women to speak on topics of particular interest or importance to them. In addition to these focus group interviews, women’s group representatives in Kigali were also interviewed, including representatives from the National Women’s Council, Rwandan Women’s Network, Haguruka, the Beijing Secretariat, the Women’s Legal Rights Initiative, and Women Waging Peace.";http://www.Landesa - Rural Development Institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/RDI_123.pdf;2006/09;English;Rwanda;Landesa - Rural Development Institute;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 73;
Human Capital, Natural Resource Scarcity, and the Rwandan Genocide;Robert M. McNab, Abdul Latif Mohamed;;Small Wars & Insurgencies;Many authors contend that ethnic extremism coupled with political manipulation were the primary factors behind the Rwandan genocide. Yet, to oversimplify the cause of this tragedy makes one blind to the complicated nexus that generated the outcome. Even though this genocide was quick in its execution, the events that lead to this massacre took years to unfold. We argue that the evolution of human capital and the competition for scarce resources contributed to the genocide.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592310600672842;2006;English;Rwanda;Taylor & Francis Online;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 74;
Conflict in the Great Lakes Region - how is it linked with land and migration;Chris Huggins, Herman Musahara, Prisca Mbura Kamungi, Johnstone Summit Oketch, Koen Vlassenroot;;Overseas Development Institute;"Africa’s Great Lakes Region has in recent years experienced political strife, armed conflict and population displacements with severe humanitarian consequences. While these events have clearly revolved around political struggles for the control of the state, recent research has pointed to the significance of access to renewable natural resources as structural causes and sustaining factors in struggles for power in the region. Contested rights to land and natural resources are significant, particularly in light of land scarcity in many areas and the frequency of population movements.
Whilst there is a growing literature on the so-called ‘resource curse’ – i.e. the potential for abundant natural resources to hamper sustainable development (Collier and Hoeffler, 2001; Le Billon, 2001), this paper belongs to a smaller literature assessing the role of claims over primarily agricultural land in fomenting or sustaining conflict. It summarises the findings of studies led by ACTS in Rwanda (focusing on the potential contribution of the new land policy to national stability), in Burundi (in relation to the return of refugees and the resettlement of internally displaced persons (IDPs)), and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (the role of land in conflict).

Land Reform, Land Scarcity and Post-Conflict Reconstruction:  A Case Study of Rwanda;Herman Musahara, Chris Huggins;;Institute for Security Studies Africa;"This case study, based on interviews in Rwanda and an extensive review of secondary material, builds on previous analysis, and examines proposed land reforms as articulated in the National Land Policy. However, it does not attempt to be a comprehensive review of the land policy – more in-depth studies have already been conducted. Instead, it situates the policy and the process involved within the wider debates about governance and conflict resolution in the country. It examines some assumptions made in the policy, and essentially looks at the political aspects of questions which are often portrayed as purely ‘technical’ issues. We suggest that “policy implementation is more likely than not to be a process of policy interpretation”; and examine governance structures which are likely to guide this interpretation.";http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/108504/ichaptersection_singledocument/42dd35f3-391b-4830-9b3d-37abdcae7bab/en/6LAND.PDF;2005/06;English;Rwanda;Institute for Security Studies Africa;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 76;
Land Scarcity, Distribution and  Conflict in Rwanda;Jean Bigagaza, Carolyne Abong, Cecile Mukarubuga;;African Centre for Technology Studies;This chapter examines the relationship between land scarcity and conflict in Rwanda. Historically, land pressure has been a severe problem in Rwanda, where over 90% of the population practises agriculture. Land pressure has resulted in declining overall agricultural production, but increasing production for individuals and groups with favourable land and resource access. Cultivation is encroaching into wetlands, national parks and forest reserve areas to satisfy unmet demands for land by some, predominately underprivileged, groups. Large numbers of internally displaced persons have worsened stress in some ecologically sensitive areas, such as in forests, resulting in localised degradation of forest resources. ;https://s3.amazonaws.com/Landesa - Rural Development Institute_production/resource/2176/Bigagaza_Chapter2-Scacrity-and-surfeit_2002.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAICR3ICC22CMP7DPA&Expires=1471356614&Signature=%2BKhKT8Mq4AhZewpLzE0KkoplJ6U%3D;2004;English;Rwanda;African Centre for Technology Studies;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 77;
Preventing Conflict through Improved Policies on Land Tenure, Natural Resource Rights, and Migration in the Great Lakes Region;Christopher Huggins;;African Centre for Technology Studies;"Since the early 1990s, parts of Africa’s Great Lakes Region have experienced political strife, armed conflict and population displacements with severe humanitarian consequences. Processes to resolve and pre-empt violent conflict in these countries are vital in order to bring regional peace.

Problématique du Régime Foncier au Rwanda: Contexte et Perspectives, Relations avec l’Habitat Regroupé;Nkusi Juvénal;;Conseil de concertation des organisations d'appui aux initiatives de Base;"Le retour des réfugiés de 1959, la politique de regroupement de l'habitat adoptée en 1996, la disette qui frappe le pays depuis 1999, la faible pluviosité qui prévaut dans le pays depuis deux ans après le phénomène el nino, conduisent à une prise de conscience nouvelle de ce qu'il faut appeler la question foncière, de ses relations avec la production agricole dans le cadre de l'option de sécurité alimentaire. Les conditions dans lesquelles la problématique foncière s'est progressivement imposée dans les analyses et préoccupations des acteurs de développement expliquent sans doute les tergiversations et les complexités d'approche, les hésitations multiples et surtout l'absence d'une circonscription précise du problème. Le droit à la terre pour les réfugiés est inscrit dans la Loi Fondamentale, principalement dans le Protocole sur le retour des réfugiés; l'Etat a l'obligation de leur trouver et de leur donner des terrains. Les exigences d'une production agricole sous la forme intensive, commerciale et spécialisée, la prédominance de la propriété familiale, la fébrilité du statut juridique de la terre en droit écrit et coutumier rendent encore difficile l'identification des filières propres à déterminer les voies de solution du problème.
Les analyses faites cherchent à isoler la question foncière du contexte socio- économique dans lequel il s'inscrit; par la suite les solutions et les propositions restent cantonnées dans des perspectives étroitement sectorielles et visent à agir sur les situations foncières, notamment les mécanismes générateurs de ces situations, symptômes de formes et de niveaux de développement dépendant et de structures sociales inégalitaires. La complication de ce problème devient de ce fait un indicateur de pauvreté et sa prise en compte, ajoutée à son intégration dans l'ensemble des perspectives de développement économique définit sans équivoque la volonté de modernisation et d'adaptation au contexte global. Longtemps oublié ou ignoré, le problème foncier est un nœud important d'insertion de l'économie rurale dans l'ensemble de l'économie nationale monétarisée.";https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/5932/3185.pdf?sequence=1;2000/05;Français;Rwanda;Conseil de concertation des organisations d'appui aux initiatives de Base;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 79;
The Urgency of Land and Agrarian Reform in Rwanda;Saskia Van Hoyweghen;;Oxford University Press;The challenges which lie ahead for post-genocide Rwanda's economic, social and political development are closely related through the issue of land. The pressure from a high rate of population growth, added to the paucity of economic opportunities outside the agricultural sector, is forcing people off the land and into poverty. Society is under extreme stress. Over the last decade the fabric of Rwandan society has been torn, resulting in ethnic and social divisions which culminpted in the events of 1994. Since then, new groups have entered the competition for land. Decisions concerning land and agrarian reform will unavoidably benefit some groups within this fragmented society while disadvantaging others. This article approaches the land problem from two perspectives: first, by situating its socio-economic dimension in a deeper historical context and second, by considering it as a specifically contemporary socio-political problem. The article discusses the latest proposals for land and agrarian reform. While pressure on land has, over time, weakened social bonds, it remains doubtful whether the government has the political strength—in the present unstable national and regional political climate—to carry out the necessary reinforcement of communal bonds which economic development appears to require.;http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/392/353.abstract.%20;1999;English;Rwanda;Oxford University Press;Land dispute and conflicts;;;land conflicts;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 80;
