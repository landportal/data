"Policy Brief: The Impact of Gendered Legal Rights to Land on the Prevalence and Nature of Intra- and Inter-Household Disputes
";;"Havugiyaremye Aimable; Dr. Simeon Wiehler; Dr. Wibabara Charity; Ndayisaba Daniel; Prof. Susana Lastarria-Cornhiel";;"Institute of Legal Practice and Development (Rwanda);  USAID Rwanda LAND Project";"Before 1999, land rights in Rwanda were governed by three regimes: customary
(traditional) law, colonial laws still in effect, and laws enacted after independence. In each of
these, men were privileged in ownership and control of land whereas women were excluded
or had fewer rights.
The 1999 Succession Law restructured and harmonized land ownership in Rwanda,
superseding all prior legislation. A significant portion of these changes related to gender
equality. Equal rights to umunani (umunani or ascending partition is an act accomplished by
parents while they are still alive, by which they share their patrimony between their children
or their descendants who acquire, each for the portion devolved to him or her, full
ownership. This partition shall be regarded as the accomplishment of parents' duties to
educate their children and to provide them with a personal patrimony.) and land succession
were granted to both sexes, and legally married spouses (including widowed and divorced
spouses) were provided with joint property rights and gender-neutral protections. Gender
equality is also reflected in the Constitution of 2003 and Law N° 08/2005 of 14/07/2005
Determining the Use and Management of Land in Rwanda repealed by Organic Law N°
03/2013/OL of 16/06/2013 and replaced by Law N° 43/2013 of 16/06/2013 governing land
in Rwanda which focuses on standardizing land registration within a revised ownership
framework.
Sixteen years have passed since the adoption of the 1999 Succession Law and its
recognition of and protections for gendered land rights. Questions are now being raised
regarding the actual impact of this legislation: What is the level of awareness of the 1999
Succession Law's gendered provisions? How much has women's land ownership actually
increased? What measures are women taking to assert their rights? How successful are
they? How are disputes resolved? What is the level of gender-based violence related to
land disputes? Do disputes within families result in more gender-based violence than those
between families? Overall, have land disputes increased or decreased?
An evaluation of the progress made in women's access to and enjoyment of their land rights
was needed to answer these questions. To this end, the USAID LAND Project contracted
the Institute of Legal Practice (ILPD) in Nyanza to conduct a study measuring “The Impact
of Gendered Legal Rights to Land on the Prevalence and Nature of Intra- and InterHousehold
Disputes”.
The ILPD research team collected data in every region of the country, using a large-scale
randomized household survey, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and data
collected directly from Primary and Intermediate Court records.

Final Narrative and Evaluation Report on Gender and Land Rights;;Radio Ishingiro;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Between October 2014 and October 2015, Radio Ishingiro with the support of USAID
Land Project implemented a Communications Campaign focused on influencing the
attitudes and mindsets of men and boys about gender-equal land rights to overcome
traditional norms and beliefs that hinder women from exercising their rights to land. In
particular, the campaign focused on overcoming traditional beliefs and norms that
hinder women from exercising their rights to inter vivos gifts of land (“umunani”)1
, land
inheritance (“Izungura”), and equal participation in household decision-making over
land. To achieve this objective, Radio ISHINGIRO partnered Radio ISANGANO in
Western Province and Radio SALUS in Southern Province.
The Communications Campaign was designed based on the results of a baseline
survey and qualitative research methods, such as Focus Group Discussions and key
informant interviews, which were conducted to assess the attitudes of men and boys
towards gender-equal land rights. The baseline survey was conducted in the
campaign’s four target districts: Gicumbi in the Northern Province, Gatsibo in the
Eastern Province, Gisagara in the Southern Province, and Nyamasheke in the Western
Province. The findings from the quantitative and qualitative research conducted as part
of the baseline surey informed the campaign topics and messages, as well as the
channels of communication utilized by Radio Ishingiro.
This report is divided into two parts. The first section provides and overview of project
activities, describes input received from local authorities on the campaign, presents
challenges faced in implementing the campaign, and offers a set of conclusions. The
second section presents the results of an evaluation of the campaign’s effectiveness,
comparing changes in men’s and boys’ attitudes and awareness on gendered land
rights with those reported during the baseline research.

Baseline Report on Gender and Land Rights;;Radio Ishingiro;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"In Africa, land has an emotional and mystical value beyond the economic consideration and
represents the social security and the continuity and independence of a family. In much of rural
Africa, land constitutes the primary source from which millions of people derive their daily
livelihoods (Bhandari 2001)
1
. In sub-Saharan Africa, women contribute between 60-80% of labor
used to produce food for both household consumption and sale to agricultural production while
women’s access to and control over land in Africa remains minimal (FAO, 1998).
2

Many international and national organizations have advocated for equality between men and
women in ownership and control of resources by calling on country governments to review their
land laws and land policies to accommodate the women’s land rights protection. According to
the World Bank (2013),3
a woman’s ability to own, inherit and control land and property is
absolutely vital to her ability to access resources and participate in the economy. The Food and
Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO), the Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and the UN Human Rights Commission have all
called for equal treatment for women and men in access to land and land reform (UN
Commission on Human Rights 2002),4 However, research shows that despite greater
acceptance of women’s rights to land in laws and policies, their implementation often runs into
significant obstacles, and gaps persist between what is on paper and the reality on the ground.
The Rwandan government has ratified an international declaration (CEDAW) committing itself to
upholding gender equality as well as made considerable legal reforms to grant equality between
men and women in property rights. Yet many women are not fully enjoying their land rights
(Celestin, 2014).5 According to the Rwanda’s constitutional principle of equality of all citizens, all
Rwandans enjoy the same rights of access to land without any discrimination whatsoever.
According to this principle, women, married or not, should not be excluded from the process of
land access, land acquisition and land control, and female descendants should not be excluded
from the process of family land inheritance (Land Policy of Rwanda, 2004:23).6 Nevertheless, a
significant number of women in many parts of Rwanda are prevented from enjoying their land
and property rights due lack of implementation land laws at lower administrative levels,
customary practices, lack of clarity and information on their legal land rights, and incomplete
knowledge about how to exercise those rights (Landesa, 2013).7";/Deliverable_2_Baseline_Report_Final_1.pdf;2015/02;English;Rwanda;USAID;Gender & Land;;Land & Gender;"gender equity in access to land; women; land rights";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 83;/Deliverable_2_Baseline_Report_Final_1_thumb.png
The Gendered Nature of Land and Property Rights in Post-Reform Rwanda;;"Jones-Casey Kelsey; Laura Dick; Alfred Bizoza";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"While there has been some empirical research on the gendered outcomes of the
legislative framework governing land in Rwanda, the breadth of these studies has
been limited. This study seeks, through rigorous field research, to inform the further
development of policies in Rwanda that can create a gender equitable society, and
ensure women and men have adequate control over the land they need to be secure, to
flourish and to reach their full human potential.
Rwanda has provided a picture of promising change for improving gender equalities
in land rights. After the genocide, many households were headed by women and
orphaned children, and the urgent need to protect their rights to remain on and
manage the land of their husbands or fathers prompted the development of the Law
no. 22/99 of 12/11/1999, the Law of Matrimonial Regimes, Liberalities and
Successions, commonly referred to as the 1999 Succession Law.
Knowledge of this law and others is widespread, due to the substantial investments by
the Rwandan Government, civil society organizations and international partners in
awareness raising. Importantly, these land-related legal interventions and their
implementation have also been transforming not only the knowledge, but also the
actions and beliefs of both men and women.
The 1999 Succession Law, among others in Rwanda’s progressive legal framework,
has had a broad impact. Because of the law and because of extensive sensitization on
gender equality, more and more women are receiving inheritance and are more often
receiving it in equal shares. Daughters are increasingly laying claim to umunani,
which was almost unheard of before the genocide. Formally married women living
under community of property marital regimes are now joint owners of property and
have greater decision-making power over it, which according to participants has
decreased distress sales and mismanagement of household land resources.";/Gendered_Nature_of_Land_Rights_in_Rwanda_Final_9June2014.pdf;2014/04;English;Rwanda;USAID;Gender & Land;Land Policy & Legislation;Land & Gender;"gender equity in access to land; women; land rights; land policies; property rights; land reform";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 84;/Gendered_Nature_of_Land_Rights_in_Rwanda_Final_9June2014_thumb.png
Property Rights for Women in Rwanda: Access to land for women living in de facto unions ;;Vanhees Katrijn;;Ghent University;"To say that access to land is one of the most important conditions for the
empowerment of African women, would be an understatement. The cultivation of land is one
of the main sources of income and economic wealth depends strongly on a well-elaborated
system of land tenure. However, developing and protecting land rights1
for women in mainly
male-dominated societies is a long-term work. Even though law initiatives2 may guarantee a
de jure equal access to land for women, the outcome highly depends on the way the culturebound
relationship between women and men is constructed.
In Burkina Faso, for instance the proverb “a woman’s field is made at night” illustrates
the difficulties women experience and the limited bargaining space they have when claiming
land. The saying can be interpreted in two different ways. First of all, it addresses the issue of
women who are being forced to cultivate their own fields during the night since they have to
work on their husbands’ fields at daytime. Moreover, the saying means that men can claim
their land rights in broad daylight because their claims to land are not contested in society,
whereas women’s bargaining space is limited to the association with their husband. Thus,
they can only bargain in private spheres during nighttime because women “will know how to
obtain what they want.”3
Therefore, women’s position in society can be improved by granting women equal
rights to land. Nevertheless, one must be cautious and keep in mind that creating formal
rights does not automatically mean that these legal provisions are translated in reality. Legal
initiatives can result in ‘paper’ rights if societies are not eager to implement or respect them.
Therefore, sensitisation and decisive judicial system are known as important implementation
mechanisms. Without denying the importance of correct implementation of formal rights, this
dissertation will merely focus on rights that remain unprotected, neither by law nor by culture
or tradition.
Following argument can explain why improving land rights for women is such a
complex process to realize. The reasoning comes down to a vicious circle. In order to throw
their weight about land rights, women should have a strong position in society to lobby. This
objective can only be reached when women can become economically more independent
instead of relying on affiliation with her family or husband. In this way, they not only have
economic agency but also gain a stronger position in the household and on a broader
governmental level. However, in order to increase their economic power, one of the key
objectives should be the improvement of female access to land. In addition, the process of
bargaining must also be seen in the sociological context of land tenure. Land regulations are
a reflection of the power structure in a society.

Women’s  Empowerment  and  Development: The  Contribution  of  Parliamentary  Gender  Quotas  and the  Case  of Rwanda ;;Stacey, Justine ;;Saint Mary's University;"As  Parliamentary  gender  quotas  have  become  increasingly  popular,  so  too 
has  the  debate  surrounding  their  effectiveness  in  enhancing  women’s 
representation and gender equality in governments around the world. Women offer 
unique and important perspectives to the political process, and thus their increased 
political  representation  and  empowerment  can  advance  the  very  process  of 
development. In 2003, the Rwandan government Constitutionally enacted a gender 
quota, requiring at least 30 percent representation of women in all areas of decisionV
making, including Parliament. By 2010, Rwandan women MPs surpassed the quota’s 
requirement and represented 57 percent of Parliament. What must be determined is 
whether Rwanda’s gender quota and resulting increased number of women MPs has 
contributed to an increase in the number and effectiveness of womenVfocused laws 
and policies. I will examine the number of womenVfocused laws in Rwanda pre and 
post quota, consider their implementation mechanisms, and use statistical data and 
interviews with  Rwandan MPs  to  analyze  the implementation  and  effectiveness  of 
these  laws.  We  will  find  womenVfocused  legislation  has  increased  significantly  in

Women’s Land Rights in Customary Dispute Resolution in Rwanda: Lessons from a Pilot Intervention by RCN Justice et Démocratie;;Marco Lankhorst;;Focus on Land in Africa (FOLA);"This brief discusses a pilot intervention in Rwanda led by the Belgian
NGO, RCN Justice & Démocratie, with support from the International
Development Law Organization (IDLO) and the Belgian Government. A
more detailed and complete discussion of the pilot is given in Lankhorst
and Veldman (2011a). The pilot aimed to transform the customary
resolution of disputes involving women’s land claims concerning
inheritance or marital relations. The intervention examined whether
and to what extent it was possible to increase the scope for acceptance
of such claims under customary law, notably, by promoting a more
inclusive approach to dispute resolution based on mediation and
negotiation techniques.";http://www.focusonland.com/download/52d425919215a/;2012/08;English;Rwanda;Focus on Land in Africa (FOLA);Gender & Land;;"Land & Gender; Land Conflicts";"gender equity in access to land; women; land rights; land policies; property rights; land reform; customary tenure; customary law; land conflicts; land dispute; land dispute resolution";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 87;/gender_dispute_rwanda_thumb.png
Empowering women through land tenure reform:The Rwandan experience;;Thierry Hoza Ngoga;Rwanda Natural Resources Authority;"United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UNWOMEN); Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights";"Since 2004, Rwanda has embarked on an ambitious land tenure reform programme (LTR) aimed
at increasing security of tenure to all land owners and the elimination of all forms of
discrimination. This has largely been achieved through the establishment and implementation of
a new legal, regulatory and institutional framework.
This paper discusses the ongoing land tenure reform programme and its impact on women’s land
rights. It focuses on the role of women in the decision making in the course of developing the
legal and regulatory framework, the rights that those tools provide to women and the
inclusiveness and protection of women’s land rights in the ongoing land registration programme.
The aim of the paper is then to draw on some best practices gleaned from the programme in
protecting women’s rights to land.

Land Policy Reform in Rwanda and Land Tenure Security for all Citizens: Provision and Recognition of  Women’s Rights over Land;;"E. Uwayezuand; Theodomir Mugirenza";;International Federation of Surveyors (FIG);"In Rwanda, for many years ago, rights over land for women and female orphans were not
recognized. The main causes were the inexistence of efficient land administration systems and
the prevalence of traditional system of land tenure which were complex and did not favor
women and female descendants. In 2004, the Government of Rwanda had adopted a new land
policy which was complemented by the 2005 Organic Land Law and a series of laws and
regulations with regard to access to land, land management perspectives, and to the modalities
of land rights transfer. The main goal of land policy reform in Rwanda is to protect and to
enforce land holders’ rights and the provision of land tenure security for all citizens without
any discrimination. The study investigates the effects the land policy reform on rights over
land for widow and female orphans. Data collected from the field survey in five districts of
Rwanda and literature review were analyzed using qualitative and interpretative methods,
following the principles of impact/outcome evaluation approach. Findings show that the
implementation of a new land policy and associate regulations are having a positive impact in
safeguard, protection and enforcement of land rights for widow and female orphans. Widow
and female orphans are given back their lands previously grabbed by their relatives.
However, there is a need to continuously and widely empower widow and female descendants
for defending themselves against practices of land grabbing and/or land deprivation through
sensitization and reinforcement of land related laws and regulations in place.

Governing Land for Women and Men: Gender and Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land and Other Natural Resources;;"Elizabeth Daley; Clara Mi-young Park";;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);"In setting out principles and internationally agreed standards, the “Voluntary Guidelines on
the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land and Other Natural Resources” intend to
provide practical guidance to states, civil society and the private sector on responsible
governance of tenure. The Voluntary Guidelines (VG) will constitute a framework for
policies, legislation and programs, but will not establish legally binding obligations nor
replace existing national or international laws, treaties or agreements (FAO 2009c). The VG
are intended to be supported by a series of “Technical Guides” – practical, up-to-date
reference tools for those working on the day-to-day ground level implementation of the VG,
and which will represent the link between the VG and the implementation processes and
actions required to improve governance of tenure. Among these guides, the Gender Technical
Guide – with the proposed title of “Governing Land for Women and Men” – will focus on
gender-equitable land governance and what this means in practice for all the national and
local government officials, civil society groups, and land administrators, technicians and
professionals working in the land sector worldwide.
The present paper is written as part of the overall VG consultation and development process
and is a contribution to the subsequent preparation of the Gender Technical Guide. The
present paper is based both on the outcomes of the VG consultation process to date and on
supporting research, consultation and literature review on gender and governance of tenure. It
contextualises and defines gender for the VG, discusses what governance of tenure means
from a gender perspective, and identifies and analyses key issues and themes. It then
summarises the recommendations relevant to gender that emerged during the VG
consultations in different regions of the world before drawing some conclusions for the
continuing VG development process.

Environmental and Gender Impacts of Land Tenure Regularization in Africa;Pilot evidence from Rwanda;"Daniel Ayalew; Ali Klaus Deininger; Markus Goldstein";;World Bank Group;"Although increased global demand for land has led to renewed interest in African land tenure, few models to address these issues quickly and at the required scale have been identi ed or evaluated.  e case of Rwanda’s nation- wide and relatively low-cost land tenure regularization program is thus of great interest.  is paper evaluates the short-term impact (some 2.5 years after completion) of the pilots undertaken to  ne-tune the approach using a geographic discontinuity design with spatial  xed e ects.  ree key  ndings emerge from the analysis.

An Assessment of Land Use Planning in Rwanda ;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Land is a critical resource. It is finite and irreplaceable. The role and efficiency of land use planning is therefore of considerable national importance. The issues faced by Rwanda in relation to land and land use planning are well recorded. They include: a) a very high population density of, b) land scarcity (total land area of 24,688 km2) and a large percentage of land that is considered undevelopable (such as wetlands or steep slopes),1 c) increasing competition for land resources with a reduction in cultivable land due to soil erosion and inadequate soil and water management, d) comparatively low rates of urbanization (18%) but with projected increases that are significant, e) historically poor mechanisms to enforce the control of land use, f) a deficit in infrastructure and basic services, g) ineffective urban management systems, and h) an inadequate supply of affordable housing that is compounding.2 Equally there are well-documented causes of optimism with the adoption of proactive planning. In some important respects and in comparison with other countries, Rwanda might be considered to be making good progress in relation to the development of a land use planning system.3
This assessment focuses on three primary dimensions in land use planning practice: the institutional and organization framework for land use planning, b) the plan development process and implementation issues arising from the plan, and c) the capacity of organizations and individuals to operate the land use planning system.";/Assessment_of_Land_Use_Planning_in_Rwanda_Munt_Aug2015_FINAL.pdf;2015/08;English;Rwanda;USAID;Land Administration;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"land use planning; land management";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 96;/An Assessment of Land Use Planning_thumb.png
Research on Rwanda's Land Administration System;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Over the last decade, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has engaged in reforming the land sector through formulation and enactment of an enabling legal framework, establishment of land administration institutions, and land tenure regularization. In 2008, the GoR initiated the Land Tenure Regularization Program (LTRP) with two main objectives: (1) to ensure secure forms of land tenure for citizens and (2) to ensure efficient management and administration of land. The program set up procedures to carry out first-time systematic registration of land in the names of its owners with the aim of creating a complete public record of landholdings.
Based on the National Land Policy of 2004, the envisaged benefits of having a good land administration were included increased security of tenure through clearly and definitively established property rights; reduction of land disputes; open and flexible land market in both urban and rural areas; increased access to credit by ordinary citizens; increased investment on land and improvement of land productivity; augmented government revenue through the collection of land taxes; efficient and decentralized land administration institutions; improved land administration and management through the use of land information; and improved physical planning through the use of a cadastral system. The LTRP substantially concluded in 2013, resulting in the demarcation of about 10.3 million parcels, encompassing the vast majority of private land in Rwanda. This program, seen as ambitious, has become a model for other countries (Ayalew et al, 2012).";/Deliverable_14_INES_Final_report_Final_Approved.pdf;2015/07;English;Rwanda;USAID;Land Administration;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"land administration; land policies; land governance";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 97;/Study on access to the land tenure administration system_thumb.png
Rwanda Land Tenure Regularization Case Study ;;"Gillingham, P.; Buckle, F. ";;Evidence On Demand;"This case study has been produced in response to a request to the Evidence on Demand Helpdesk. The objective of the request was to provide a detailed case study on the approach taken to land tenure reform by the DFID-funded Land Tenure Regularisation Programme (LTRSP) in Rwanda. The case study should provide the reader with an understanding of how land tenure reform can work under particular social, political and economic conditions, as well as the approach taken to ensure gender equality in land rights.
The LTRSP registered all the land in Rwanda (10.3 million parcels) for the first time. It involved a one-off, low-cost, community-based process of land tenure regularisation (LTR), costing UK£3.42 (US$5.47) and UK£4.05 (US$6.48) per parcel. As well as identifying key success factors (political commitment; a detailed LTRSP developed in an earlier phase of the programme; flexibility), the case study also identifies some of the threats to the sustainability of the LTR process – namely, the sustainability of the Land Administration System (LAS), as well as financial and judicial sustainability.
This case study provides an example of rural LTR. Rwanda has only one significant urban centre (Kigali), but the vast majority of land within the province labelled ‘Kigali City’ is rural.

Pursuing Gender Equality in Land Administration;;"Helle Munk Ravnborg; Rachel Spichiger";;Danish Institute for International Studies;"Ensuring gender equality with respect to land rights is hailed as a key element of the recent land reforms, but actual results in this respect are limited.  Achieving gender equality requires a comprehensive focus on land, family and other laws, including customary, pertaining to land and on their implementation on the ground.

This DIIS Policy Brief summarises the findings from a series of reports made to review progress made and the challenges remaining to achieve gender equality with respect to land rights. On that basis, it proposes the following five recommendations for policy and practice:

Ensure that provisions ensuring non-discrimination in family law and customary law accompany recent provisions for gender equality in land legislation.
Strengthen the focus on comprehensive implementation and enforcement of land legislation. In doing so, draw upon the lessons learned by civil society organisations in their efforts to promote gender equality in land administration and dispute resolution.
Explore and institutionalise ways to enhance the effective accessibility to women of statutory as well as customary land administration and dispute resolution institutions at all levels – irrespective of their social and economic status – e.g. through promoting female representation in customary as well as statutory land administration and dispute resolution institutions.
Monitor and measure success of land administration institutions at all levels in terms of their contribution to achieving gender equality in land administration, e.g. through ensuring the registration of gender-disaggregated data.
Document and analyse the social, economic and political impacts of gender (in)equality on land access and land administration on a regular basis.";http://www.diis.dk/files/media/publications/import/extra/pb2014_gender-land-adm_hmr_rachel-spichiger_web_2.pdf;2014/02;English;Rwanda;DIIS;Land Administration;Access to Land & Tenure Security;Land & Gender;"gender equity in access to land; land administration";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 99;/Pursuing Gender Equality in Land Administration_thumb.png
Lay of the Land : Improving Land Governance to Stop Land Grabs;;"Isabel Crabtree-Condor; Leora Casey";;ActionAid;"Large-scale land acquisitions by investors, which are often called ‘land grabs’ (see next section for de nition), can deprive rural women and communities of their livelihoods and land, increasing their food insecurity. This report argues that the current rise in land grabbing needs to be urgently addressed, and focuses
on the actions that developing countries can take to mitigate land grabs through strengthening national land governance so that it is transparent, is accountable and protects communities’ rights.
For most rural communities and women in the developing world, access to land is the difference between being able to sustain a livelihood to support their families and going hungry. rural women in developing countries are among the poorest and most neglected people worldwide; despite the critical roles they play in promoting food security, women control less than 2 per cent of land globally.1 Half the world’s food is produced by small- holder farmers, the vast majority of them women – making land indispensable for their livelihoods and for global food security.2 but unless women have more secure tenure over land, food insecurity in developing countries will not improve, and women themselves will be the most likely to go hungry.
The importance of land to rural women goes beyond growing food. Having secure access to, and independent control over, land can mean the difference between, on the one hand, enjoying rights such as education and freedom from violence or, on the other, continual subjugation in society. The security of land tenure for impoverished rural communities is a fundamental component of digni ed, sustainable development and a crucial step towards reducing poverty and reducing inequality.
This report is divided into two parts. The  rst looks at the impact of land grabbing on com- munities and highlights three issues: that women’s rights to land are not being protected in practice; that communities do not have secure land tenure, which is adversely affecting their food security; and that the priorities of foreign investors are outweighing those of local people.
The second part of the report contains 24 country reviews that examine the strengths and weaknesses of each country’s regulatory frameworks, assessing their ability to: provide legislative protection for communities at national and local levels from land grabs; guarantee gender equality at national and local levels; and regulate investment through the measures in place. We also attempt to report the key challenges, innovative practices and lessons learned, which, although context-speci c, may be useful for other countries facing similar land governance challenges.";http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/lay_of_the_land_-_improving_land_governance_to_stop_land_grabs_low_res_1.pdf;2012/10;English;"Bangladesh; Brazil; Burundi; Cambodia; Democratic Republic of Congo; Ethiopia; Ghana; Guatemala; Haiti; Kenya; Liberia; Malawi; Mozambique; Nepal; Nigeria; Pakistan; Rwanda; Senegal; Sierra Leone; South Africa; Tanzania; Uganda; Vietnam; Zambia";Action Aid;Land Administration;Access to Land & Tenure Security;;"land grabbing; land grabs; land governance; land policies; land tenure systems; land access; land policies";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 100;/Lay of the land_thumb.png

Land Administration Developments in Rwanda;;Eugene Rurangwa;;International Federation of Surveyors (FIG);"The new Rwandan land policy consider appropriate land administration as a platform of land management and an ideal channel to provide security of livelhood to the people by securing land tenure system for their profit.
At present Rwanda carries out limited land registration on a centralised manual system on a demand led basis in rural and urban areas. Currently approximately 20,000 land applications are in process, mainly in urban areas.
In rural areas, initial documentation, including a sketch plan and a description of the property is issued to the user and held in a cadastral database at the Ministry in charge of lands.
In urban areas, municipal authorities are responsible for registering land and demarcate plots for urban development.
The land policy commits Rwanda to a comprehensive programme of land registration, in order to provide land users as a whole with more certain rights and thereby promote the investment of labour and capital in increased productivity, and the sustainable development and management of land resources. In addition land registration could extend the tax base in rural areas, and in any further development of further planned settlements or imidugudu.
The land policy stipulates the creation of land registries in each of the 104 rural districts and 8 urban municipalities. A dual system of land registration will be adopted. The formal system would apply to high value land, urban areas and commercial enterprises or other land users requiring detailed documentation for legal and financial purposes. A system of local land registration for the majority of rural areas will be developed and managed by the Districts. This process will be vastly aided by use of high resolution photomaps derived from aerial photography, also proposed as a tool for local level land use planning, to facilitate reconciliation of individual and family rights with land parcels.
In urban areas and all others where there are commercial incentives, formal titles to individual land parcels will be registered following enacted legislation with demarcated boundaries. The cadastral project now operational in Kigali City Council may be taken as a model of a demand-driven self-financing land register that utilises automated methods to capture and output land information.

Final Report: Rwanda’s Expropriation Law and Outcomes on the Population;;;Legal Aid Forum;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Rwanda is developing at a remarkably rapid pace, and with that development has come a
multitude of corresponding changes to the orientation and use of land throughout the country.
In light of these changes, law n°18/2007 of 19/04/2007 relating to expropriation in the public
interest was adopted to provide clear procedures for the government to follow in the taking of
privately-owned land for other uses deemed to be in the public interest.
This law provides procedures for notice to affected landowners, the determination of public
interest, and valuation of land, including how to challenge valuation when a landowner does
not agree with the valuation provided, and also provisions for timely payment of
compensation and damages if compensation is not paid on time. These are all important
principles in line with international standards and best practices for expropriation. The
implementation of the law, however, has caused some criticism and concern. This research
seeks to address those concerns by carrying out systematic quantitative and qualitative
analysis about the implementation of the expropriation law and its outcomes on the population
of Rwanda, and in particular expropriated households.
The two major themes of the research are: 1) the implementation of the law from the
procedural perspective; and 2) assessing the effects of expropriation law and policy on
expropriated households. The procedural rights examined in the research include aspects such
as whether the concerned communities were involved in determining the “public interest”
nature of the project, and whether expropriated households received sufficiently detailed
notice at the proper time to adequately inform them that their properties would be
expropriated. Procedural rights also concern whether expropriated individuals were given a
fair valuation of their property by impartial valuers, and whether they had an opportunity to
challenge aspects of the process they believed violated their rights, as well as whether
compensation was provided in the proper time, and to all rights-holders. The assessment of
socio-economic impacts of expropriation, the second prong of the research, aims to determine
what types of impacts, both positive and negative, expropriation may have had on
expropriated individuals’ lives and the communities in which these projects have been
implemented. This includes both objective analysis (changes in income, etc.), and subjective
analysis (changes in attitudes, perceptions, etc.).
In summary, the data obtained through this study revealed that insufficient and delayed
compensation were the most important issues to property owners, government stakeholders,
and expropriating institutions, which suggests the possibility for collaborative efforts to
decrease delays and improve the integrity of the valuation process. The research also measures
the price paid per square meter of expropriated land, revealing expected variations based on
the character and location of the land. However, unexpected variations emerged based on the
expropriating entity paying the compensation when controlling for the character of the land,
project type, and other potentially confounding factors. These arbitrary differences in land
values can be addressed by improving the independence of the valuation process and
providing improved channels for citizen involvement in the valuation process.";/LAF_Final_Research_Report.pdf;2015/07;English;Rwanda;USAID;Land Rights;Land Policy & Legislation;;"land policies; land law; expropriation; compensation; land law";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 104;/The implementation of rwanda's expropriation_thumb.png
LAND Project Policy Brief: Implementation of the Expropriation Law in Rwanda ;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"This policy brief aims to inform policy and current practices governing land expropriation in Rwanda drawing on recent research carried out by the LAND Project. The brief elaborates on the legal framework and procedures guiding expropriation and on reported practice based on information gathered from primary and secondary sources. It then proposes measures that would potentially strengthen implementation of expropriation exercises countrywide.
In drafting this policy brief, the authors examined laws and policies governing expropriation, reviewed relevant literature and articles in the media, and interviewed key informant interviews from government institutions and civil society organizations (CSOs). Key informants1 were selected based on their knowledge of and involvement in expropriation issues.
Following this introduction, Section 1 presents legal definitions of expropriation and discusses the history land expropriation in Rwanda, including factors that led to the drafting and promulgation of law and policies that have influenced the practice of expropriation. In Section 2, we elaborate on domestic policies and laws as well as international legal instruments to which Rwanda is signatory that guide how expropriation is implemented. We examine in depth Law no 18/2007 relating to expropriation in the public interest and the different organs involved in expropriation.
In Section 3, we highlight factors driving expropriation in Rwanda and issues emanating from the implementation of expropriation of Rwanda, particularly in urban zones. Drawing on information reported by key informants, the media, and published papers; we examine the practice of expropriation and the outcomes experienced by those who have been expropriated. In the fourth section, we policy and other recommendations based on lessons learned from expropriation exercises in Rwanda and analysis of how they can be improved to facilitate more favorable outcomes.";/Implementation_of_Expropriation_Law_in_Rwanda_Revised_11April2015.pdf;2014/05;English;Rwanda;USAID;Land Rights;Land Policy & Legislation;;"land policies; land law; expropriation; compensation; land law";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 105;/implementation of expropriation law in rwanda_thumb.png
How Land Tenure Regularization Can Contribute to Agricultural Growth in Rwanda;;"Daniel Ayalew Ali; Klaus Deininger; Marguerite Duponchel; Loraine Ronchi";;World Bank Group;"After remarkable social and economic reconstruction since 1994, Rwanda aspires to become a middle income country by 2020 with a strong focus on inclusive growth. In this context the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has recognized the critical nature of land policy and agricultural growth. The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) identifies higher agricultural productivity and transformation of the sector towards high value added as a key pillar and points towards land registration as a critical element to achieve this goal by increasing productivity of land use, reducing conflict, empowering women, and improving overall governance. Agriculture accounts for about 36 percent of Rwanda's GDP, 80 percent of employment, and, in 2010, 45 percent of foreign exchange earnings. It also provides 90 percent of the country's food needs. Land Tenure Regularization (LTR) program in 2009, designed-after extensive piloting-to register the country's estimated 10 million parcels. This ambitious program, which has become a model for other countries, has the potential to improve the livelihoods of millions of Rwandans. It also highlights that doing so will require decisions to overcome challenges in a number of areas including: 1) increasing the protection of potentially vulnerable groups such as traditionally married women; 2) ensuring the long term sustainability of the land records by building adequate capacity of the decentralized administration and clarifying law provisions; and 3) linking the mortgage and land registries. Continued monitoring will help ensure that progress in doing so is tracked and obstacles to achieving desired impacts identified early.";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/209081468107337330/pdf/731550BRI0P1270200PN0Baseline0final.pdf;2012/10;English;Rwanda;World Bank Group;Land Rights;"Access to Land & Tenure Security; Land Policy & Legislation";;"tenure regularization; land tenure systems; land ownership; land policies; land law; customary tenure";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 106;/How Land Tenure Regularization can contribute to agricultural growth_thumb.png
"Land Reform in Post-Genocide Rwanda: Connecting Sustainable Livelihoods and Peace building
";;Fumihiko Saito;;Ryukoku University;The world today faces a wide range of critically important issues, whose resolution require inter- national collaboration of various stakeholders. Environmental conservation and conflict resolution are such examples. Interestingly enough, these two issues have been until very recently conceptual- ized as separate problems, and coordinated resolution came to be pursued only recently. This paper attempts to connect these two critical agendas by using the case study of land issues in Rwanda in Africa. Land issues were one of the most important background factors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Establishing appropriate land regulatory framework in post-genocide Rwanda is indispen- sable for sustainable peace in this part of the world. Whereas the land registration piloted in four areas in 2006 and 2007 presents some promises, this exercise also invites additional concerns, which need to be carefully considered in the scaling up process.;http://www.world.ryukoku.ac.jp/~fumis96/docs/rwanda.pdf;2011/12;English;Rwanda;Ryukoku University;Land Rights;Land Policy & Legislation;;"land reform; land policies; land law; land conflicts; natural resource management";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Journal Articles & Books;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 107;/Land Reform in Post-Genocide Rwanda_thumb.png
Environmental and gender impacts of land tenure regularization in Africa: Pilot evidence from Rwanda;;"Daniel Ayalew Ali; Klaus Deininger; Markus Goldstein";;Elsevier;We evaluate the short-term impact of a pilot land regularization program in Rwanda using a geographic discontinuity design with spatial fixed effects. Three key findings emerge from the analysis. First, the program seems to have improved land access for legally married women (about 76% of married couples) and prompted better recording of inheritance rights without gender bias. Second, we find that the program was associated with a very large impact on investment and maintenance of soil conservation measures. This effect was particularly pronounced for female headed households, suggesting that this group had suffered from high levels of tenure insecurity which the program managed to reduce. Third, land market activity declined, allowing us to reject the hypothesis that the program caused a wave of distress sales or widespread landlessness by vulnerable people. Implications for program design and policy are discussed.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2013.12.009;2014/09;English;Rwanda;Elsevier;Land Rights;Land Policy & Legislation;"Land & Gender; Land, Climate Change & Environment";"gender equity in access to land; environment; tenure regularization; land tenure systems; land ownership; property rights; land administration";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Journal Articles & Books;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 108;

Women’s Land and Property Rights in Situations of Conflict and Reconstruction;;;UNWOMEN;United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UNWOMEN);"Women constitute the majority of small farmers, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, in countries around the world, they continue to be denied the right to own the ground that they
cultivate and on which they raise their families. This publication, “Women’s Land and Property Rights in Situations of Conflict and Reconstruction,” presents a diversity of views and experiences that describe the multiple strategies being used in countries worldwide to secure women's rights to land and property.
Nowhere is the impact of unequal land rights more acutely felt than when women find themselves obliged to fend for themselves and their families as a result of conflicts which have cost them the husbands, brothers or fathers in whose name land and property was traditionally held and passed on. On returning home to the fields they used to work and the house they used to keep, women in many countries find themselves denied access, often by their former in-laws or neighbours. Without the security of a family home or the income and produce of their fields, women and their dependants may be pushed to the margins of society, further exacerbating their struggle to achieve health and well-being for their families and themselves.
Against this sombre background, the unstinting efforts of women at all levels to keep families functioning in adversity, maintain community dialogue and sustain the fabric of social development, go largely unsung. Against all the odds, women continue to organise to address their livelihood and empowerment needs, and increasingly to champion their rights. They want a place at the peace table. And they are lobbying for new legislation that can enable them to acquire land, property and credit facilities with which to restart their lives. Above all, they recognise that conflict, with its attendant trauma and displacement, has also honed their existing skills and taught them new ones. As returnees from refugee situations - or something like that, they are not prepared to revert to the status quo ante but wish to capitalise on the changes brought about in adversity.
In recognition of women's determination to secure these new opportunities, UNIFEM, together with the United Nations Centre for Human Settlement (Habitat), the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), convened the first
____________________________________________________________________ 6 Women’s Land and Property Rights in Situations of Conflict and Reconstruction
Inter-Regional Consultation on Women's Land and Property Rights in Situations of Conflict and Reconstruction. This took place under the aegis of the Government of Rwanda in Kigali, in 1998, barely four years after the genocide which tore an already divided society and its component communities apart. This ground-breaking Conference brought women from across Africa, South and Central America, the Balkans, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region to compare notes and exchange experiences. Striking similarities became apparent, despite the wide variety of contexts from which the case-studies were drawn. Despite advances in the international rights regime, persistent discrimination evident in the customary laws which regulate women's status in most traditional societies was a constant factor across cultural, social and political divides.
The case-histories and testimonies recorded by the Kigali Consultation provide an insight into changes in land and inheritance rights brought about by conflict and its attendant social disruptions. Out of the acute distress experienced by women caught up in such circumstances, has grown a new realisation by the women themselves of their resilience and strength in adversity. Their stories testify to a new determination to assert women's rights in their productive, reproductive and ownership roles, all three representing long- term investments in their future communities and societies.
The Kigali papers which follow represent only a snapshot of what has been taking place around the world, for the process is ongoing. Whether society will recognise these gains, secure them through new legislation -- as has since happened in Rwanda itself, -- capitalise on women's capacities, and allow them their rightful place at the peace table and in decision-making at all levels, is the subject for new chapters which are still being written. It is UNIFEM's role to assist in this process. I feel privileged, as one of many contributing to this work, to be able to salute the efforts of such women around the world working tirelessly and often invisibly to make these changes a reality.";http://iknowpolitics.org/sites/default/files/womenslandandpropertyrights.pdf;1998/02;English;Rwanda;UNWOMEN;Land Rights;Access to Land & Tenure Security;"Land & Gender; Land Conflicts";"property rights; gender equity in access to land; women; land access; security of tenure (land); land conflicts";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 111;/Women's land and property rights in situations of conflict_thumb.png
Impact of the Land Reform on the Land Rights and Economic Poverty Reduction of the Majority Rural Especially Women Who Depend on Land for their Livelihood;;"Annie Kairaba; James Daale Simons";;Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development;"Good land governance today is one of the current global debates because of its centrality in managing diverging interests, competing claims, and processes of inclusion and exclusion related to land rights1 as a key resource of majority of developing countries. The importance of good land governance in strengthening women's land rights as a major source of their livelihood cannot be over emphasised. However, major challenges remain posed by recent global pressure on land due to urbanization as part of land reform2 like the recent strategy of promoting land expropriation in the name of economic development planning which threatens the land rights of women even further as women have no resources to participate in such complicated programs that are both highly political and heavy financially demanding, since women especially the rural do not have such a capacity and space. Therefore, the recent move of putting in place common guideline for good land governance for Africa, the ‘Africa Land Policy Framework and Guidelines’ (ALPFG) signed by the heads of states of the continent in 2009, as a strategy with a vision to promote good land governance that will strike a balance between protecting rights of the poor and marginalised groups like women, while providing the path to economic progress and social justice, is very timely.
Indeed such debate is very relevant to Rwanda where land is believed to be a key good governance area, since land is the most important asset for production and livelihoods in the country3, especially for the majority rural poor, in particular rural women who mainly depend on land for their livelihood. Land also remains the foundation of the country’s economy, hence, an important link to the politics of the country4. Good land governance debate is also very relevant to Rwanda given that the country is implementing land reform for the first time in its history, stating its own main objective5 as that of ‘achieving sustainable development strategy towards poverty reduction, by providing equal land rights to women as that of men’. The implementation of land reform in Rwanda is implemented through a program known as “Land Tenure Regularisation Process (LTRP), which is done through systematic land registration”. The process is discussed in more under section 4 below. Although debate on the impact of systematic land registration in relation to land rights in general is still live, Rwanda opted for the systematic registration strategy with a belief that it presents more opportunities to protect women’s rights.";http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTIE/Resources/475495-1302790806106/GOV6Pres3Kairaba2.pdf;2011/12;English;Rwanda;Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development;Land Rights;Land Policy & Legislation;Land & Gender;"land reform; land policies; poverty; gender equity in access to land; women; land rights";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 112;/Impact of land reform on the land rights_thumb.png

Pilot Land Tenure Registration in Rwanda: Evidence of Initial Impacts;;"Daniel Ayalew Ali; Klaus Deininger; Markus Goldstein; Mercedes Stickle";;World Bank Group;A survey of some 3,500 households in and adjacent to land tenure regularization (LTR) pilot cells was undertaken some 2.5 years after completion of the LTR pilot. The results of the survey provide evidence on the fairness and gender inclusiveness of the regularization process, households’ knowledge of the law, and initial investment impacts. A large majority of those asked perceived the process as very fair and transparent. It was, however, more thorough and inclusive in rural than in urban areas, where more than 11 percent of certificates could not be issued because of a pending conflict. Despite the short time elapsed since registration, land-attached investment (and maintenance of existing structures) is significantly higher in the treatment area compared to the control area. A high frequency of land transfers suggests an urgent need to complement LTR with mechanisms to register transactions on an ongoing basis to ensure sustainability of benefits. We can, however, reject the hypothesis that these transfers are distress sales or disproportionately involve female land holders. Introducing mechanisms to improve awareness of legal knowledge will also help achieve the full potential of the program in a sustainable manner.;http://www.rwandaland.org/en/landresearchanddata/land-rights;2010/12;English;Rwanda;World Bank Group;Land Rights;Land Use, Management & Investment;;"land administration; land tenure systems; security of tenure (land); title deed; customary tenure";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 114;/Pilot land tenure registration in rwanda_thumb.png
Land, Business and Human Rights  ;;Salil Tripathi;;Institute for Human Rights and Business;"This is the first of a series of consultations on the human rights challenges and dilemmas involved in the
acquisition and use of land – held individually or collectively - for private or state-owned business and
economic purposes. The aim of the series of consultations is to develop a framework that leads to an end of
human rights abuses at any stage of the process – before acquisition, during acquisition, and after operations
have commenced and, if necessary, relocation and rehabilitation arranged, and compensation paid.
This requires strengthening and enforcing the existing legal mechanisms; identifying situations in which the
land acquisition should not take place; highlighting gaps in administration of laws, practices, and policies;
and recommending a framework that businesses should follow as part of their land acquisition process.
The purpose of this paper is to inform and stimulate discussion for the human rights and land roundtable.
Some of the questions being raised are meant to provoke a robust discussion, and there is no pre-determined
outcome.
The Institute aims to organise up to three more consultations of this nature, in different cities, over the next
15 months. Possible locations include Bogota, Colombia; Lagos, Nigeria; and London, UK. The Institute
would like to keep you engaged in the process over the next 15 months.

Land Rights Issues in International Human Rights Law;;Elisabeth Wickeri, Anil Kalhan;;Institute for Human Rights and Business;"Up to one quarter of the world’s population is estimated to be landless, including 200 million
people living in rural areas,1
 and approximately 75% of the world’s population living in extreme
poverty (less than $1/day) live in rural areas.2
 According to the Food and Agriculture Agency of the
United Nations (FAO), “rural landlessness is often the best predictor of poverty and hunger.”3
“While not the only pathway out of poverty, ample evidence suggests that access to land is effective
in helping rural households generate higher incomes” through the sale of crops and the money saved
when the family feeds itself from the land.4
 Yet, even though “land constitutes the main asset from
which the rural poor are able to derive a livelihood . . . . [m]illions of families, though they toil on the
land, do not enjoy ownership rights over it and are considered landless.”5

The condition of landlessness threatens the enjoyment of a number of fundamental human
rights. Access to land is important for development and poverty reduction, but also often necessary
for access to numerous economic, social and cultural rights, and as a gateway for many civil and
political rights. However, there is no right to land codified in international human rights law.
Land is a cross-cutting issue, and is not simply a resource for one human right in the
international legal framework. And yet, while rights have been established in the international legal
framework that relate to land access for particular groups (e.g. indigenous people and, to a more
limited extent, women), numerous rights are affected by access to land (e.g., housing, food, water,
work), and general principles in international law provide protections that relate to access to land
(e.g., equality and nondiscrimination in ownership and inheritance), an explicit consideration of the
legal implications of access to land for a broad range of human rights is necessary.

Improving Access to Land and Tenure Security;;;International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD);International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD);"Secure access to productive land is critical to poverty, acknowledging the complexity and
dynamics of evolving rural realities; (b) identify
the major implications of that relationship for
IFAD’s strategy and programme development
and implementation; (c) articulate guiding
principles for mainstreaming land issues in
the Fund’s main operational instruments and
processes; and (d) provide the framework for
the subsequent development of operational
guidelines and decision tools.
In this policy, land refers to farmland,
wetlands, pastures and forests. Land tenure
refers to rules and norms and institutions that
govern how, when and where people access
land or are excluded from such access.2
Land tenure security refers to enforceable
claims on land, with the level of enforcement
ranging from national laws to local village
rules, which again are supported by national
regulatory frameworks. It refers to people’s
recognized ability to control and manage land
– using it and disposing of its products as
well as engaging in such transactions as the
transferring or leasing of land.
The focus on land does not mean that the
inherent linkages to other natural resources,
especially water, are ignored. Rather, the aim
is to ensure a policy, institutional and
operational focus that would otherwise be
diluted if the scope were broadened to the
larger issues of access to natural resources,
and of governance and management.
the millions of poor people living in rural areas
and depending on agriculture, livestock or
forests for their livelihood. It reduces their
vulnerability to hunger and poverty; influences
their capacity to invest in their productive
activities and in the sustainable management
of their resources; enhances their prospects
for better livelihoods; and helps them develop
more equitable relations with the rest of their
society, thus contributing to justice, peace
and sustainable development.
According to the IFAD Strategic Framework
2007-2010,1 the Fund’s first strategic objective
is to help “ensure that, at the national level,
poor rural men and women have better and
sustainable access to ... natural resources
(land and water), which they are then able to
manage efficiently and sustainably.”
Land access and tenure security issues are
linked, directly or indirectly, to all the strategic
areas of IFAD’s interventions. Land issues are
of particular concern, today, when population
growth, high food prices, the impact of
climate change, trade regimes, global
consumer- and corporate-driven food
systems and growing demand for agrofuels
and feed are causing fierce competition for
land and very high pressures on tenure
systems. In a new era of high food and fuel
prices, these pressures are likely to intensify
further. They threaten the land and tenure
security – and hence the food security and
livelihoods – of millions of poor rural people
whose access to land was not previously
under threat. This in turn raises the risks of
environmental degradation and social conflict.

Regional Differences regarding Land Tenancy in Rural Rwanda, with Special Reference to Sharecropping in a Coffee Production Area;;ShinichiTakeuchi, Jean MarieMarara;;Center for African Area Studies - Kyoto University;"This paper examines land tenancy systems and tenant contracts in Rwanda, with
respect to socioeconomic contexts. Our research in southern and eastern Rwanda produced
data suggesting that land borrowing with fixed rents has been generally practiced, and that rent
levels have been low in comparison to expected revenues from field production. In the western
areas of coffee production, however, the practice of sharecropping has recently appeared. This
system is advantageous to landowners, as they are able to acquire half of the harvests; in
addition, the fixed rent levels in this region are much higher than those of other regions. In the
southern and eastern regions, because land borrowing with fixed rents has been the only
tenancy pattern and rent levels have remained low, the economic situation should be interpreted
in the context of a continuing traditional Rwandan land tenure system. In contrast, in the
western coffee production area, the soaring of fixed rents and the emergence of sharecropping
have been brought about by high pressures for land use, which were caused not only by a
population increase but also by the development of cash crop production and the existence of
a labor exchange system. The increase in rent levels has therefore been offset by a corresponding
increase in agricultural productivity.";http://www.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_suppl/abstracts/pdf/ASM_s35/5TAKEUCHI.pdf;2007/03;English;Rwanda;African Study Monographs;Land Rights;"Access to Land & Tenure Security; Land Use, Management & Investment";;"land tenure systems; tenant farmer; farmers; security of tenure (land); land ownership; land rights";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Journal Articles & Books;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 119;/regional differences regarding land tenancy in rural rwanda_thumb.png

Drawing a line under the crisis: Reconciling returnee land access and security in post-conflict Rwanda;;John Bruce;;"Overseas Development Institute; Humanitarian Policy Group";"This report is part of a broader comparative effort by As the author worked with colleagues in Rwanda,
two other important dimensions of the Rwandan
experience became clear. Refugee return and land
access in Rwanda has been an extraordinarily
complex matter, with some refugees leaving just in
time for others returning to take up their homes and
lands. Rwanda has important lessons to teach us
about the need to maintain flexibility in dealing with
complexity, and raises questions about whether
obviously well-meant but very specific requirements
in international conventions can be applied with full
rigour in all cases. In addition, the Rwandan
experience highlights the fact that conflict and postconflict
are not two ends of a simple spectrum, but
overlap. Refugee return and economic
reconstruction similarly overlap, and this creates
challenges in framing policy and legal responses
that address adequately the diverse claims and
needs that arise.

what responses are appropriate and what lessons
can be learned from specific contexts of land tenure
interventions, both during and after conflict.
ODI selected Rwanda for one of the country studies

Improving Tenure Security for the Rural Poor.  Rwanda – Country Case Study;;Herman Musahara;;"Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO); National University of Rwanda";"Most of the world’s poor work in the “informal economy” – outside of recognized and enforceable rules.
Thus, even though most have assets of some kind, they have no way to document their possessions
because they lack formal access to legally recognized tools such as deeds, contracts and permits.
The Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) is the first global anti-poverty initiative
focusing on the link between exclusion, poverty and law, looking for practical solutions to the challenges
of poverty. CLEP aims to make legal protection and economic opportunity the right of all, not the
privilege of the few. (see http://legalempowerment.undp.org/)
CLEP has identified specific tenure issues, including i) how to make property rights accessible to all,
especially poor and marginalized communities, groups or individuals and ii) how to ensure that property
rights of the poor function as means of achieving economic and social empowerment, particularly in the
context of gender equity and those affected by HIV/AIDS.
There is growing empirical evidence that giving legal recognition to informal property rights in urban
areas brings positive results. However, a similar body of evidence does not exist for the empowerment of
people in rural areas. Instead, the signs are mixed, resulting in a largely sterile and divisive debate on
formalization of rights.
FAO, with donor funding from Norway, has undertaken a set of activities for “Improving tenure security
of the rural poor” in order to meet the needs of FAO member countries and, in turn, support the CLEP.
This work falls within the FAO corporate strategy on “Sustainable rural livelihoods and more equitable
access to resources”. Recognizing that secure access to land and other natural resources (forests, water,
fisheries, pastures, etc.) is a crucial factor for eradication of food insecurity and rural poverty, FAO’s
cross-departmental and cross-disciplinary work focused 2005-2006 activities on sub-Saharan Africa
which has the world’s highest percentage of poor and hungry people.
This paper is part of FAO’s effort to inform the CLEP through its working group on property rights. It
was prepared for the regional technical workshop on “Improving tenure security of the rural poor” held
in Nakuru, Kenya, October 2006, at which issues relating to property rights were reviewed and actions
were initiated to develop common strategies for improving the protection of rights to land and other
natural resources of the rural poor.

Women’s Land Rights in Rwanda: How can they be protected and strengthened as the Land Law is implemented;;Jennifer Brown, Justine Uvuza;;Landesa;"In Rwanda, two factors make land a highly important and contested issue. First,
Rwanda has the highest person-to-land ratio in Africa. This creates tremendous
pressure on land in a country where most of the population lives in rural areas, and
where agriculture remains the central economic activity. Second, Rwanda is recovering
from massive population shifts caused by decades of ethnic strife and the 1994 civil war
and genocide, which resulted in displaced populations and overlapping land claims.
Due to the high person-to-land ratio, many rural families that depend on land resources
hold plots of sub-optimal size. Concurrently, insufficient land for the landless and for
Rwandans returning from years or decades as refugees abroad is also a problem that the
government has attempted to remedy through the controversial policies of “land
sharing” and grouped settlement, or “villiagisation.” Additionally, there are conflicting
claims to land parcels, which have been created by a series of population displacements
and returns since 1959.

Conflict in the Great Lakes Region - how is it linked with land and migration;;"Chris Huggins, Herman Musahara, Prisca Mbura Kamungi, Johnstone

political strife, armed conflict and population displacements

Contested rights to land and natural resources are significant,
particularly in light of land scarcity in many areas and the
frequency of population movements.

‘resource curse’ – i.e. the potential for abundant natural
resources to hamper sustainable development (Collier and

1996, la disette qui frappe le pays depuis 1999, la faible pluviosité qui prévaut dans le
pays depuis deux ans après le phénomène el nino, conduisent à une prise de
conscience nouvelle de ce qu'il faut appeler la question foncière, de ses relations
avec la production agricole dans le cadre de l'option de sécurité alimentaire. Les
conditions dans lesquelles la problématique foncière s'est progressivement imposée
dans les analyses et préoccupations des acteurs de développement expliquent sans
doute les tergiversations et les complexités d'approche, les hésitations multiples et
surtout l'absence d'une circonscription précise du problème. Le droit à la terre pour
les réfugiés est inscrit dans la Loi Fondamentale, principalement dans le Protocole
sur le retour des réfugiés; l'Etat a l'obligation de leur trouver et de leur donner des
terrains. Les exigences d'une production agricole sous la forme intensive,
commerciale et spécialisée, la prédominance de la propriété familiale, la fébrilité du
statut juridique de la terre en droit écrit et coutumier rendent encore difficile
l'identification des filières propres à déterminer les voies de solution du problème.
Les analyses faites cherchent à isoler la question foncière du contexte socio-
économique dans lequel il s'inscrit; par la suite les solutions et les propositions
restent cantonnées dans des perspectives étroitement sectorielles et visent à agir sur
les situations foncières, notamment les mécanismes générateurs de ces situations,
symptômes de formes et de niveaux de développement dépendant et de structures
sociales inégalitaires. La complication de ce problème devient de ce fait un indicateur
de pauvreté et sa prise en compte, ajoutée à son intégration dans l'ensemble des
perspectives de développement économique définit sans équivoque la volonté de
modernisation et d'adaptation au contexte global. Longtemps oublié ou ignoré, le
problème foncier est un nœud important d'insertion de l'économie rurale dans
l'ensemble de l'économie nationale monétarisée.'";https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/5932/3185.pdf?sequence=1;2000/05;French;Rwanda;"Conseil de concertation des organisations

Land Tenure under Unendurable Stress: Rwanda Caught in the Malthusian Trap;;Catherine André, Jean-Philippe Platteau ;;Université de Namur - Centre de Recherche en Économie de Développement;"This paper reports the findings of an in-depth case study of a highly densely populated area in the Northwest of Rwanda
which has been conducted during the period 1988-1993. It
demonstrates that acute competition for land in a context
characterized by too slow expansion of non-agricultural income
opportunities has resulted in increasingly unequal land distribution
and rapid processes of land dispossession through both operation
of the (illegal) land market and evolution of indigenous tenure
arrangements. It is also shown that pervasive incidence of land
disputes and the threat of landlessness have led to rising tensions
in social relations and even within the core of family li&, thus paving the way for more and more overt expressions of disharmony and violence. A connection between these ominous conditions and the
civil rear that broke out in 1994 is established.";https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/5453/2744.pdf?sequence=1;1996/01;English;Rwanda;Centre de Recherche en Economie du Développement;Land Rights;Access to Land & Tenure Security;;"land tenure systems; rural population";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 130;/landtenureunderunendurablestress_thumb.png
Land Tenure in Rwanda;;M. Reintsma;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;In a country with the highest population density of all Africa, and 95% of this population dependent on land, the question of land tenure is inevitably a vital issue. In Rwanda it is becoming even more crucial as marginal lands are cultivated, and competition for land, and thus a livelihood, increases. The currently prevailing land tenure systems in Rwanda vary from one area of the country to another, reflecting both differences in traditional customary laws, and the adoption, at varying degrees in different regions, of written law in place of customary law. This report attempts firstly to briefly trace the major developments in these two sources of law in order to provide a background to the  present de jure situation, and secondly, as far as is possible given limited data, to describe some aspects of the current de facto land tenure systems;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAK438.pdf;1981/10;English;Rwanda;USAID;Land Rights;Land Policy & Legislation;;"land tenure systems; land policies; land law; research";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Reports & Research;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 131;/landtenureinrwanda_thumb.png
LAND Project Report: Vulnerability and Knowledge of the Legal Framework on Land;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"This report presents the results of a small scale household survey that was conducted in May
2015 to assess the extent to which rural Rwandan citizens are vulnerable or resilient to
environmental, market and land tenure risks and the level they understand the laws and rights
related to land. The report also compares the results of the survey with those from the baseline
survey conducted in May 2014, and seeks to inform the LAND Project of its progress in
achieving objectives entailed in the project’s results framework, namely:
1. Overall LAND Project Objective: Strengthened resiliency of citizens, communities, and
institutions and their ability to adapt to land-related economic, environment and social
change.
2. Objective 1, PIR 1: Increased understanding and use of land laws, regulations, and
judgments by local GoR officials, civil society organizations and Rwandan citizens.
Indicators to assess realization of these two objectives, respectively, are featured in the
project’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan:
Indicator: No 3: Percent of women and men in target districts who report that changes
in land-related policies and laws have reduced their vulnerability (e.g. to dispossession
from their land, encroachment, fluctuations in market prices, droughts, crop diseases,
etc.)
Indicator: No. 12: Percent of target population (women and men) who demonstrate
improved understanding of the law and their rights
The follow-up survey employed the same methodology used during the baseline survey, and
administered the survey to the same households that were randomly selected for the baseline
study. The purpose was to enable observation of changes (if any) in respondents’ experiences,
knowledge and perspectives that were examined in the initial baseline study.
The project aimed to survey the same 328 individuals from the 200 household interviewed in the
2014 baseline survey.1 However, only a total of 308 individuals could be surveyed since some of
the respondents relocated to far away regions, traveled or died. Given that the number of
original respondents who could not be interviewed did not exceed 10% of the intended sample,
the project is confident that the 308 repondents interviewed is a sufficient sample to measure
change over time.

LAND Project Policy Brief: Wetlands in Rwanda;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Rwanda has nearly 280,000 hectares of wetlands, almost 11% of the country’s total
area.1 These wetlands provide critical habitats for wildlife and biodiversity, maintain
important hydrologic processes that help to clean and protect ground and surface
water, support a variety of local livelihoods and largely define Rwanda’s idyllic
undulating topography.
2 Despite their ecological and economic importance, Rwanda’s
wetlands are being degraded and lost faster than any other ecosystem, with
projections suggesting a continued and increasing rate of loss due to climate change,
competition for resources, and land use conversions.
3 Currently, over half of
Rwanda’s wetlands are being used for agricultural use or energy production.
4 Ongoing
conversion of wetlands to agriculture, or for other economic activities, has increased
in recent years due to a growing population competing for limited land resources of
declining productivity.5
In order to protect a vulnerable and valuable ecosystem,
Rwanda is presently seeking to formalize use procedures and sustainable wetlands
management strategies through regulations, policies and plans.
To address wetland loss and degradation, land use planners and administrators are
seeking to impose more rigorous restrictions on wetlands management and use.
Policies, projects, incentives and regulations are being considered and developed to
ensure protection, restoration and sustainable use. These new policies must balance
human interest and land use with protection of biodiversity, wetland hydrologic
function and the environmental integrity of vulnerable ecosystems.
In Rwanda, all wetlands belong to the State and several laws frame processes for
wetland management and protection; however, there is a lack of clarity surrounding
the procedures for determining uses of wetlands that ensure their long term
sustainability. Without a clear mandate on how projects in wetlands should be
approved from the government, there has been some lack of detail surrounding
several key issues pertaining to wetlands use and protection, including: definitions of
terms, land tenure and pre-existing freehold titles, public use of State land, and
sufficiency of protection mechanisms. In spite of these issues, there is strong political
will to improve and adapt wetland policies so that sustainable use balances
conservation of wetland areas.";/Policy_Brief_on_Wetlands_in_RwandaFINAL.pdf;2015/09;English;"Rwanda; Uganda; Botswana; Senegal; Zambia; Tanzania";USAID;Environment & Climate Change;Land Use, Management & Investment;Land, Climate Change & Environment;"land use; land policies; land law; ";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 133;/balancingwetlandsustainableuse_thumb.png
LAND Project Policy Brief: Climate Change Adaptation Within Land Use and Tenure Reforms in Rwanda;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"Across equatorial and east Africa, climate change is affecting the frequency, intensity
and variability of regional climate patterns.1 Changes in rainfall patterns, temperatures
and storm intensity are having significant effects on national economies, regional
infrastructure, land use and local livelihoods. These changes are forcing national and
local governments to adjust and adapt how they plan, prepare and implement day to
day operations today and larger visions for the future. The ability of governmental
policies and programs to address challenges from climate change will ultimately
determine how economies grow and how social welfare and the environment are
preserved and protected.
In Rwanda, climate change impacts are forcing the government to integrate adaptation
measures to ensure that its environment, its economy, and, most importantly, its
people are able to withstand the negative effects of floods, storms and droughts.
Within the last two decades, and even more so in recent years, Rwanda has included
climate change adaptation elements into some land use policies, regulations, programs
and national growth strategies, although these elements are often weak and lack
substantive direction or mandate for land use planners and managers. Additionally,
since the implementation of those policies is, in many cases, too recent to determine
how effective they are at reducing risks and vulnerabilities to climate change, there
still exist opportunities for Rwanda to learn from the performance of matured policies,
strengthen current adaptation approaches, adopt best practices from regional examples
sharing similar experiences, and better integrate climate change adaptation
interventions across governmental action.
Climate change impacts in Rwanda are amplified by a fast growing population under
an increasing density distribution, with a large portion (45%) of the population living
below the poverty line and increasing competition for dwindling natural resources.
2
These challenges have led to unsustainable and unhealthy land use practices,
including: settlements on steep slopes and in floodplains, deforestation, overcrowding
in urban areas, and poor waste management, to name a few.3 With projections in the
near future pointing toward increases in population, higher temperatures and more
variable rainfall patterns, climate change impacts may be dramatically more intense
in the near future and under increasing pressure from unsustainable land use. Rwanda
has an opportunity now to incorporate sustainability and climate change adaptation
measures into land use and tenure policies to accommodate larger future generations
and reduce climate change risks through mitigation efforts implemented today.
Climate change policy is still relatively young in Rwanda, having only been triggered
from staggering research findings in 2009.4
Since then, Rwanda has moved to
integrate climate change adaptation into policies, programs and land use planning processes. Previously, many indirect adaptation efforts were already embedded within
existing programs that were not explicitly designed for climate change, even if they
do have risk mitigation implications. Strengthening existing programs and adopting
addtional direct adaptation policies will be key to ensuring Rwanda’s adaptive
capacity in the shadow of increasing climate change risks.
This policy brief will: examine key impacts of climate change in Rwanda, assess the
performance and implementation of climate change adaptation measures in land use
policy frameworks and suggest key recommendations that could strengthen Rwanda’s
land use policies to better integrate climate change adaptation measures.

LAND Project Policy Brief: Contested Claims over Protected Area Resources in Rwanda;;;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;USAID Rwanda LAND Project;"The aim of this policy brief is to describe current and historical conflicts over rights to
land and natural resources within and surrounding protected areas in Rwanda. We
examine the roots of contested claims between citizens and the State and offer some
potential avenues for resolving these conflicts in ways that consider both the priorities of
the Government of Rwanda and the rights of local communities that depend on
protected area resources.
Information and analysis in this brief draws on semi-structured interviews conducted
with some government line agencies, several non-governmental organizations,
1
and
private sector actors affiliated with Rwanda’s protected areas, reports and papers
available online, and recent articles in the media.
We begin this brief by providing an overview of protected areas in Rwanda (Section 1).
Section 2 then highlights the legal framework governing rights to use and manage land
and natural resources in protected areas in Rwanda, as well as rights to the economic
benefits generated by those protected areas.
In Section 3, we show how rights to natural resources legally vested in the State have
been contested by private citizens and the rationales for these competing claims. In
Section 4, we provide measures undertaken by the Government of Rwanda (GOR) and
other partners to mitigate or resolve contested claims. The last section presents
conclusions and offers some avenues for resolving contested claims through
reconfiguration of rights regimes that seek to uphold environmental and biodiversity
objectives while also contributing to improved livelihoods for local communities.";/Contested_Claims_over_Protected_Area_Resources_in_Rwanda_5March2014_Final.pdf;2014/03;English;Rwanda;USAID;Environment & Climate Change;Land Use, Management & Investment;Land, Climate Change & Environment;"land conflicts; land rights; natural resources management; land tenure systems; use rights; land management; sustainable land management";USAID Rwanda LAND Project;Policy Papers & Briefs;Rwanda LAND (Research) - 135;/contestedclaimsoverprotectedarearesources_thumb.png
Final Report: Land Use Consolidation and Crop Intensification In Rwanda;;;;"USAID Rwanda LAND Project; National University of Rwanda";"The Land Use Consolidation Act (LUC) was introduced in 2008 and is an important
component of agricultural policy in Rwanda. As part of the Government of Rwanda’s
broader Crop Intensification Program (CIP), LUC entails participating farmers
consolidating aspects of their operations with neighboring farmers, while retaining
individual ownership of their parcels. LUC farmers also agree to grow a single priority
crop that has been identified by the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) as best suited to
local conditions and consistent with Rwanda’s overall agricultural strategy. The rationale
for LUC is that joining small plots together to farm as a single unit would deliver
important economies of scale in agricultural production, resulting in improvements to
efficiency and sustainability, which would in turn boost household well-being and
promote greater equity.
LUC is a large-scale initiative, and by 2011 approximately 13% of the total land area
under cultivation in Rwanda was under LUC, with approximately 40% of the farmers in
the country participating (MINAGRI, 2012). LUC has been implemented to some extent
in all districts of Rwanda, and continues to expand to additional areas.
Despite the importance of LUC, research related to the program has been limited, and
there is a wide range of sometimes contradictory perspectives on its impacts. The present
research project aims to fill this gap and reconcile these divergent views by providing a
thorough and detailed analysis of the realities, perceptions, and impacts of LUC/CIP on
socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. The research was carried out by a team at
the National University of Rwanda with technical support from NORC at the University
of Chicago as part of the LAND Project funded by USAID, and implemented by
Chemonics International Inc. in Rwanda.
