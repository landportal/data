The Project will improve access to spatial information and thus possibilities for inter-agency cooperation and public participation in environmental and other spatial planning and management processes. Easy access to spatial information is a precondition for private sector involvement in economic development, participatory democracy, good governance (transparency), reduction of inequalities and fair sharing of benefits from natural resources, which all contribute to poverty reduction. More efficient data sharing will create savings by reducing duplication of work by various agencies. In particular, accurate coastal and marine spatial data also support the planning of adaptation to climate change, which is imperative for small islands communities like Zanzibar. The project lasts for 3 years from 2016-2018 and its budget is 719 000 €.

Results areas are:
1) Increased capacity for developing and maintaining the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)

Soil degradation, forest loss and monocultures make it even more vulnerable to climate change. Regional efforts to harmonise climate protection activities and biodiversity goals have so far been unsuccessful.

FLR is seen here as an approach that treats the entire landscape as a whole. The objective of the project is to restore forest resources in a way that is appropriate to the landscape as part of REDD+ in Central America.  Therefore, in supporting measures for preserving landscapes (e.g. compensation mechanisms), the different types of use that lead to increased carbon storage must be taken into account and the various user groups (small-scale forest owners) must be involved in designing the mechanisms.

FAO has worked with community groups in a number of Nigerian states, including Kaduna, on forestry and agriculture. Kaduna has the added advantage of being one of three states where the FAO’s open source land administration (SOLA) software has been implemented in support of systematic land titling and registration (SLTR) pilots undertaken through the DFID-funded GEMS3 project. Another three to five states are expected to implement SLTR pilots using SOLA by early 2014. The proposed Open Tenure Crowd Sourcing software will be highly relevant to the SLTR work and especially for scaling-up activities when GEMS3 ends. Community based activities to strengthen their tenure rights using Open Tenure Crowd Sourcing tools that have common components and similar processes such as used in SLTR will be more easily aligned.

At least half of these producers are women. The current program builds on the achievements of previous CIDA projects in the horticultural and forestry sectors, and in strengthening producers’ organizations (both women and men). However, this new activity takes the form of a program-based approach. Five government technical services and eight rural communities are the project’s key partners, with the Directorate of Horticulture of the Ministry of Agriculture as the sponsoring ministry.

This program makes it possible to consolidate past activities, especially those involving the filao strip.

"MOD:1279";"Data for Sustainable Development Goals";"This is a project where the Norwegian Mapping Authority, SSB and our respective counterparts in Kyrgyzstan will work together in a joint effort to further improve the efficiency of the Kyrgyz institutions, especially in the field of using maps and register information for production and dissemination of statistics. Experience from Norway has shown that both types of organisations gain from working together, and monitoring and reporting on the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires cooperation between data owners, producers of maps and producers of statistics.

Background

SRS/DCR has spearheaded major reforms to the land sector in Kyrgyzstan. Impressively, it takes only one day to register a sale or a mortgage. However, there is no solution for distribution of maps via Internet, which is vital for statistical purposes. Maps are currently not easily available and used for preparation of statistics in Kyrgyzstan. Kartverket, SRS and DCR will work closely together with Statistics Norway (SSB) and the National Statistical Committee of Kyrgyzstan (NSC) to integrate geospatial data to serve statistical needs in line with Objective 3.4 of the Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data.

Kyrgyzstan also lacks up-to-date photomaps. The current photomaps in use are made in 2002 and do not show changes that occurred since that time. There is an urgent need for new photomaps that are produced from aerial imagery.  Likewise, up-to-date line maps in vector form do not currently exist. Such maps are especially needed for Bishkek.   

The project will ensure access to maps via a national Geoportal (to be developed in the project), inter alia, to provide geographic data for statistical purposes. A main goal of the project is to prepare geographic data (maps) needed for production of statistical data supporting implementation and reporting on Sustainable Development Goals for Kyrgyzstan.  This project should be considered as a component to a well-coordinated and integrated effort on strengthening the capabilities of Kyrgyz governmental institutions to provide maps and statistical data for sustainable development. The coordinated efforts will also facilitate use of the various registers at the State Registration Service for production of statistics.

Activities

1.Making geographic information available for statistical purposes:
◦Collection of existing maps to support statistics nationwide. Existing maps will be collected, analyzed, upgraded if needed, and stored in a format suitable for distribution online via the geoportal, inter alia, to be used for statistical purposes
◦Development of principles, standards and procedures for data sharing between respective data-holders in Kyrgyzstan.
◦Development of a geoportal for distribution of data. The activity will start with specifying the requirements.

2.Production of photomaps and line maps: ◦Aerial photography and photomap production for 20 000 km2 including Bishkek and surrounding areas, settlements around Issyk-Kul Lake and in Fergana Valley.
◦Preparation of line maps for Bishkek, 150 km2. The line maps will be prepared using the same aerial images as prepared for the photomaps. 
◦Quality control of deliverables. All data delivered is subject to quality control, which will be executed by SRS/DCR assisted by Kartverket and with potential support from the State Geodetic Institute in Kyrgyzstan “Goskartographia”.
◦Development of a solution for efficient distribution of photomaps online via the geoportal.

3.Capacity building, public awareness campaign ◦A number of training courses for technical personnel will be held in Norway and Kyrgyzstan, supporting all activities of the project
◦Public awareness campaign will promote the institutional cooperation between Kyrgyz authorities on sharing data and making data available for distribution via the geoportal as well as targeting users of geo-information.";"";"";"KGZ";"climate change;land access;land administration;land conflicts;land dispute;land dispute resolution;land governance;land law;land markets;land ownership;land policies;land tenure;land tenure systems;land use planning;land valuation;legal empowerment;security of tenure (land);title deed";"Land Conflicts;Land & Investments;Land in Post-Conflict Settings;Land, Climate Change & Environment";"2017-01-31";"2020-12-31";"USD";"1200000";"1200000";"";"Elena Busch, Norwegian Mapping Authority <Elena.Busch@kartverket.no>";"";"Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation";"Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket)";"Global Donor Platform for Rural Development"

During the project FAO reviewed two versions of a draft Law on land consolidation prepared by StateGeoCadaster (SGC) and provided legal recommendations and advice how to review the drafts in line with best international practices and VGGT principles such as a key principle in land consolidation that participants should be at least as well off after the schemes as before.
The legal advice provided was fully relying on the VGGT, and respecting the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
The Project contributed to SDG 1.4, 2.3, 5.A and 8.3 and emphasized the role of efficient farm structure and the land markets in attaining aforementioned SDG goals and at country level contributed to VGGT implementation.

PRADD and PRADD II were developed to support country compliance with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The overarching goal of PRADD and PRADD II are to increase the percentage of diamonds entering the legal chain of custody, while improving the livelihoods of artisanal diamond mining communities. PRADD II is financed through a Congressional Earmark in support of the Clean Diamond Trade Act and managed by USAID’s Land Tenure and Property Rights Division within the E3 Bureau. The LTPR Division closely coordinates with the US Department of State and US Geological Survey who also provide support to the KPCS.  
PRADD II will continue to be a landmark program for the United States Government (USG), the Kimberley Process and the development community at large. PRADD was one of the first and largest development projects concentrated on the Kimberley Process and artisanal diamond mining challenges. Significantly, PRADD has been instrumental in helping the KPCS modify its goals from a narrow focus on traceability, regulation and enforcement systems to a broader focus recognizing the role of economic development in bringing rough diamonds into legitimate chains of custody, and consequently better addressing the challenges of conflict diamonds. This transition is demonstrated by the recent adoption of the Washington Declaration (http://usaidlandtenure.net/pradd/washington-declaration) at the 2012 Kimberley Process Plenary meetings that occurred in November in Washington, DC. Due to the limited number of development institutions and experiences in the artisanal mining sector, PRADD II will continue to test and evaluate approaches to achieving its objectives while also consolidating program successes, to encourage other donors and governments to implement PRADD-type programs to achieve KPCS objectives.";"";"";"GIN;CAF;CIV";"compensation;customary law;customary tenure;eminent domain;expropriation;land access;land acquisitions;land administration;land conflicts;land dispute;land dispute resolution;land governance;land investments;land law;land markets;land policies;land rights;land tenure systems;land transfers;land use planning;legal empowerment;security of tenure (land);title deed";"Land Conflicts;Land & Investments;Land in Post-Conflict Settings";"2013-01-31";"2018-01-31";"USD";"18900000";"18900000";"https://land-links.org/document/program-brief-pradd-ii/";"Anthony Piaskowy, USAID <apiaskowy@usaid.gov>";"";"USAID";"Tetra Tech";"Global Donor Platform for Rural Development"

"MOD:1282";"Sustainable Development & Management of the Petroleum Sector in Sudan";"The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) has a four-year project within the Oil for development program. The main objective of the project is to obtain more exploitation of oil from existing reservoirs. As part of the project, assistance using GIS for departments under the Ministry of Petroleum and Gas is included. 



Purpose

The Oil for Development (OfD) Programme offers assistance to developing countries in their efforts to manage petroleum resources in a sustainable manner. Oil and gas play an important role in an increasing number of developing countries, and have the potential to generate economic and social development. In several cases, however, it has proven difficult to translate the resource into improved welfare for citizens of those countries. Through the OfD Programme, Norway shares its experience from five decades of managing oil and gas resources. Some key characteristics of the Norwegian experience are strategic ownership by the state, strong and competent institutions, continual accumulation of technical knowledge, an advanced regulatory system with high respect for the environment, health and safety, and perhaps above all – society’s determination to secure national control over its petroleum resources.

NPD will in the OfD Programme cooperate with Ministry of Petroleum and Gas (MOPG) in Sudan within the project “Sustainable Development & Management of the Petroleum Sector in Sudan”. One component in the project is a Geographical Information System (GIS). The Norwegian Mapping Authority will contribute with deliverables on behalf of NPD within GIS data management.

The main target of the project is to implement a sustainable infrastructure for acquiring, maintaining and distributing spatial data, including:
•Spatial Data management
•Standardization of data and exchange
•GIS and Imaging Tools
•Distribution tools including web portal and web services
•Human resource skills, knowledge and capacity to manage, maintain and enhance the infrastructure

Activities

The project is divided into three phases:
1.Phase 1 involves creating data models for the spatial data, creating a data repository, implementing a GIS tool, and publishing a standard for the spatial data (for its’ content, structure and exchange).
2.Phase 2 involves creating a web portal for viewing, browsing and basic capture of spatial data; implementing image processing and management tools; and establishing web services for stakeholders.
3.Phase 3 involves setting up online communication channels for stakeholders; enhancing GIS functionality for analysis; and ensuring that an infrastructure for spatial data is operative";"";"";"SDN";"land access;land acquisitions;land administration;land conflicts;land dispute;land dispute resolution;land governance;land investments;land law;land policies;land tenure systems;land transfers;land use planning;legal empowerment;security of tenure (land)";"Land Conflicts;Land & Investments;Land in Post-Conflict Settings";"2015-01-31";"2019-12-31";"USD";"190000";"190000";"";"Sabrina Grimsrud, Norwegian Mapping Authority <sabrina.grimsrud@kartverket.no>";"";"Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation";"Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket)";"Global Donor Platform for Rural Development"

Inclusion encompasses indigenous/minority communities active participation in the decision making processes of planned, or on-going, extractive enterprises that have the potential to negatively impact their lands, societies, livelihoods, and biodiversity.  Enhancing the ability of people, communities, and local/regional governments to address complicated issues surrounding extractive activities directly works towards USAID’s mission to (1) build local sustainability and partnerships, (2) foster innovation, and (3) strengthen USAID’s capacity to deliver results.  Extractive activities primarily refer to mining (alluvial and hard-rock) and hydrocarbon enterprises.  A key focus of this project will be strengthening organizations, including applied research centers that work on preventing and mitigating conflicts arising over extractive activities.  Developing and disseminating applicable tools for improved conflict management is a project priority.
Select South and Central American countries have been identified as priorities for USAID conflict alleviation work in the LA region; this project will therefore focus primarily on these LA sub-regions.

Elle sera bientôt adaptée au Burundi dans le cadre d'un projet pilote financé  par le PPCDR dans deux communes de la province de Cankuzo, visant à exploiter les orthophotos dans le cadre des reconnaissances parcellaires. Le but recherché du présent projet est d'ouvrir la porte à une reconnaissance systématique ultérieure du territoire national, c'est pourquoi le projet va mettre l'accent sur l'appropriation du projet par les ministères techniques concernés et, surtout, les services du Cadastre National, qui seront équipés et dont les compétences seront renforcées. En outre, la nature complexe des conflits fonciers au Burundi nécessite que l'enregistrement des terres domaniales s'accompagne de mesures visant en parallèle la résolution des éventuels conflits fonciers.

"MOD:1283";"Maps for good land governance";"This project aims at establishing a public service for precise use of GPS technology for surveying and mapping, and a digital base map for the whole territory of Ukraine including occupied areas, with a data content and accuracy equivalent to scale 1:50 000. This corresponds to what exists in most other European countries. 

Challenges and justification for project

Ukraine has a territory of 603.000 km2, of which as much as 2/3 are arable land. Sustainable land management is crucial to economic development. Maps are indispensable for land- and territorial management as well as for many other purposes in public and private sectors. Up-to-date maps are available for 20 % only, and these maps are not integrated into a user oriented electronic service. For the remaining 80 % there are only old maps from the Soviet time.

Maps are not easily available to users in Ukraine. As in most other European countries, basic maps should be made available on the Internet and harmonized with other thematic data, according to the concept of National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). Despite that Ukraine is not an EU member, the Government wants to implement their NSDI in accordance with the EU Inspire directive.

Activities
1.Preparation of digital map for the whole territory of Ukraine and a solution for distribution of the maps for good governance, land use planning and sustainable land management, as well as for implementation and reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals.
2.Establishing a network of ground stations needed for a public service supporting precise use of GPS technology for boundary surveys, etc. building on the previous project.

Components
1.Produce new maps using satellite images to update existing old maps. This will include making a product specification to ensure that the data is structured for optimal use, and will include verification and upgrading of the data model for the database, which will hold the maps.
2.The second component of the project is to integrate the existing digital maps and the updated old maps into a single seamless database.
3.The third component is to establish a solution for efficient access to the maps and satellite images for all users in Ukraine. This should be done in accordance with the concept of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure, in line with European standards outlined in the EU INSPIRE directive and adjacent standards and guidelines. This will lead to a more transparent and efficient land administration in Ukraine.
4.The fourth component of the project is to establish a network of ground stations and a related public service (Ukrainian Positioning System = UAPOS), supporting precise use of GPS technology. It is proposed to start the establishment of UAPOS with 90 reference stations, prioritizing areas with the most intensive development and active land market, and with a central control facility at the SALR premises in Kiev. A business plan for the service will also be developed to ensure sustainability. The system will improve the surveying and mapping of parcel boundaries, thus improving public services to the emerging markets in land and reduce conflicts over ownership, which is a massive problem after restitution of private ownership to land. This corresponds to the situation in Norway and in many other European countries, where the State operates a high quality and strictly controlled service in addition to private positioning services.
5.The fifth component of the project is training, capacity building and awareness raising. The training focuses on improving the capacity of the StateGeoCadastre to efficiently implement all activities of the project. Awareness campaigns will focus on informing public institutions and other users about the availability of maps and related terms for use. Such maps are an indispensable information resource for good governance, and are urgently needed for many purposes in Ukraine; inter alia, for land management, environmental planning and reporting, for improvements to infrastructure, for water management, for adaptation and mitigation of effects of climate change, as well as for a wide range of other usage at all levels of public sector, and in private sector.";"";"";"UKR";"compensation;eminent domain;expropriation;fisheries;forest land;indigenous peoples;land access;land acquisitions;land administration;land allocation;land conflicts;land consolidation;land dispute;land dispute resolution;land distribution;land governance;land law;land markets;land policies;land reform;land rights;land tenure systems;land transfers;land use planning;land valuation;legal empowerment;public ownership;security of tenure (land);state property;title deed";"Land Conflicts;Land & Investments;Land in Post-Conflict Settings;Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"2017-01-31";"2020-12-31";"USD";"4400000";"4400000";"";"Maria Lodin, Norwegian Mapping Authority <Maria.Lodin@kartverket.no>";"";"Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation";"Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket)";"Global Donor Platform for Rural Development"

"MOD:1281";"Key Registers for e-Government & EU-integration";"The Republic Geodetic Authority of Serbia (RGA) is the institution in Serbia entrusted with production and coordination of geographic information, and is hosting some of the key registers, such as properties, addresses and administrative units. In the future, RGA will manage their key registers in a new service oriented architecture (eliminating redundant storage of data, ensuring that registers are updated continuously directly form the data sources.)



Background and Justification

RGA and Kartverket have for more than 10 years cooperated in projects on improving the Serbian infrastructure of geographic information and land management, among the project results are:
•Scanning and transfer of old cadastral maps to digital data
•Establishment of a Digital Archive for Land Administration Data
•Developing strategy and realizing cooperation between stakeholders of geographic information in Serbia
•Realization of a web portal for exchange of map data and geographic information
•Specifications of a new Real Estate management system (cooperation with the World Bank)
•Assessment the quality of property information (Data Migration Pilot - ongoing)

In the same period there has been significant developments having impact on the operation of RGA:
•Serbia have launched an e-Government program and are developing a number of services for digital interaction between the public, businesses and public institutions.
•The European Union has implemented a series of standards under the INSPIRE directive framework, obliging public institutions to make geographic information available on standardized formats and services.

This project focuses on upgrading the key registers of RGA enabling integration with the Serbian e-Government, also enabling INSPIRE compliant services for geographic information. 

Project Objectives

The overall objective is to support RGAs role as an online provider of property-, and geographic information to enable realization of efficient e-Government services, and European Standardisation. More specifically:
1.To establish three new registers (Addresses, Administrative Units and Condominiums) as an integrated part of the RGA key registers, communicate with external data through services, and support the e-government of Serbia.
2.To make geographic information available to the private and public enterprises as well as the citizens with geoportal and services that comply with the INSPIRE directive of EU.
3.To integrate the new registers with services with other registers both internally and externally to RGA, thus maintaining continuous and coordinated updating and efficient work processes.";"";"";"SRB";"compensation;eminent domain;expropriation;indigenous peoples;land access;land acquisitions;land administration;land allocation;land conflicts;land consolidation;land dispute;land dispute resolution;land distribution;land governance;land law;land markets;land ownership;land policies;land reform;land tenure;land tenure systems;land transfers;land use planning;land valuation;legal empowerment;security of tenure (land);title deed";"Land Conflicts;Land & Investments;Land in Post-Conflict Settings;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"2018-01-31";"2020-12-31";"USD";"1100000";"1100000";"";"Maria Lodin, Norwegian Mapping Authority <Maria.Lodin@kartverket.no>";"";"Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation";"Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket)";"Global Donor Platform for Rural Development"

Background

The LAKI II project approved for EEA funding 2009 -2014 focused on production of maps and photomaps, as well as on establishment of detailed terrain model using laser scanning, for about 50 000 km2. This project (LAKI III) will focus on preparation of a digital terrain model for larger parts of Romania related to prevention and mitigation of floods. Due to limited financial resources NACLR does not have a digital terrain model of high/average precision, required to achieve cartography, topography, geodesy, photogrammetry and remote sensing in the entire country.

"MOD:1284";"Regional Geoid for the Balkans";"Since a geoid is the ratified framework on which mapping and measuring work in each country is based, creating a common geodetic reference frame for neighbouring Balkan countries will facilitate seamless combination of geographic data across borders. As we know, the effects of climate change and mitigation of the effects are not confined to national borders and increasing regional cooperation among the actors involved in managing these issues would only be beneficial. 



Background

Through the Norwegian Mapping Authority, the Government of Norway has for many years assisted countries in the Western Balkan region in preparing geographic information and in establishing services ensuring access to the information.

The partner institutions are (with some variation) functioning satisfactorily, but lack funds to prepare up-to-date geographic information, and access to this type of information for their respective land and sea territories is limited. Data to deal with the effects of climate change is a special challenge, and partner institutions are also challenged with meeting European standards on access to geographic information. Because of the socialist legacy, partner institutions still need to improve their register services for the emerging land markets in privatised properties.

The overall goal of this regional project is improved governance on central, regional and local levels; sustainable land use; secure land markets; and safe navigation at sea.

This will be achieved through three interwoven objectives: increased and sustainable well-being, strengthened institutions and governance, and improved nutrition and health. Each of these objectives constitutes a core component of the REGIS-ER program.
Given its importance to incentivizing intensification, facilitating diversification and mitigating conflict, one component of REGIS-ER will actively facilitate land tenure policy reform, as well as effective land tenure policy implementation. REGIS-ER also works directly with women’s groups to improve women’s access and rights to land.

The development objective of the Second Land Administration Project is to improve the design and implementation of the land registration system in the project area. There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is systematic land registration in the project area. This component will provide resources to the Palestinian Land Authority (PLA) to complete Systematic Land Registration (SLR) of at least 180,000 dunums of land in the West Bank to be implemented in two phases, and to develop their capacity to further implement SLR in the rest of the West Bank. The second component of the project is institutional strengthening of the PLA. This component will assist the PLA in implementing its mandate and, in particular, managing systematic land registration through institutional strengthening including provision of enabling technology and office modernization. The third component of the project is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component supports the consultants for the Project Management Unit (PMU); incremental operating costs for the PMU; and project monitoring and evaluation.

The current project is also piloting an approach to forest landscape management in four provinces, and piloting village forestry in at least 30 villages in this area. It is supporting work on payment for environmental services (PES) and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). Forest and wildlife law enforcement activities continued to be supported, as well as work on key relevant policy, legislative, and regulatory issues. The project also disseminates information on project issues, and aims to raise awareness regarding climate change and REDD+.

SUFORD-SU is not only developing its own monitoring and evaluation systems for the project, but working to develop and strengthen government monitoring, reporting, evaluation, and analysis capabilities.

Through real estate registration data development, the project will support land register and cadastre data harmonization on land, buildings and rights based on the actual situation in the field. The objective is to establish up-to-date and interlinked land register and cadastre databases, or integrated databases of real estate cadastre. The project will encourage and support the registration of legal rights in the land register (in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [FBH]) or the real estate cadastre (in the Republika Srpska [RS]) using project produced data. 

Through real estate registration infrastructure development, the project will continue the Land Registration Project (LRP) work in improving working conditions and infrastructure in the cadastre offices across the country and in those few land registration offices in the FBH that were not targeted by LRP. The objective is to improve working conditions, which will help to improve the quality of customer services, the adherence to service standards developed during LRP, and staff morale. Access to basic surveying technologies will be provided to areas and offices that still rely on conventional methodologies, and sustainability of the recently installed Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) network will be assured. Information technology investments will lead to further interlinking between real estate registers and other public datasets making the data accessible online to a wide audience and in support of multiple uses. This will lead to the incremental provision of electronic online services and eventually to electronic conveyancing.

"MOD:651";"Advancing Understanding of Forest Carbon Stock Enhancement as part of REDD+";"For Vietnam and Lao PDR, which contain large areas of degraded forests the issue of forest carbon stock enhancement should be an integral part of any National REDD+ Strategy. To date, in these countries, like in most others, the focus of REDD+ efforts has been on deforestation and to a lesser extent forest degradation. Accordingly, there is a matching deficiency in guidance material and national approaches to forest carbon stock enhancement as part of the REDD+ Strategy.
This project aims to advance understanding of forest carbon stock enhancement as part of any future REDD+ Agreement through exploring the technical and economic feasibility of different forest carbon stock enhancement strategies in pilot sites, across Vietnam and Lao PDR. The sites will be chosen to reflect representative forest ecosystems of the region. The results and operational guidance will feed into the National REDD+ Strategies, which will ensure their replication across the respective countries. The project also aims to better understand the economic feasibility of different options and the incentives which need to be in place to engage local communities and improve their living conditions.
To bring the results to a wider audience, publications, regional and international workshops and communications platforms will be used to disseminate the lessons to the many individuals working on REDD+ and interested in advancing understanding of Forest Carbon Stock Enhancement as part of REDD+.

The Green Prosperity Project includes a $43.1 million Participatory Land Use Planning (PLUP) activity to support participatory land use planning - administrative boundary setting, updating/integration of land use inventories and enhancing of spatial plans at the district and provincial level to support investment in renewable energy and sustainable management of natural resources.
In general, the PLUP Activty is designed to: (i) put in place the foundational spatial (land use) planning elements needed to enable and sustain the specific investments in renewal energy and natural resource management funded by the GP Investment Facility; (ii) improve land use certainty for communities within the districts selected for GP investments; and (iii) support compliance with environmental and social performance standards and safeguards.  
Specifically, the PLUP is expected to: (i) enhance the technical capacity of provincial and district governments in spatial (land use) analysis, planning and enforcement; (ii) identify and, when possible, reduce land use and land tenure disputes as a means to improve the investment climate for renewal energy and natural resource management projects; and (iii) empower communities by providing spatial (locational) certainty through participatory geo-location and demarcation of village boundaries and the mapping of critical natural and cultural resource areas within these villages.
Compact funding will finance the completion of the following technical activities.
1)	Participatory village boundary setting and community mapping (VBS/CM), including: 
(i) 	the development of district level guidelines for participatory setting of village boundaries using established Government processes combined with international best practices, modern survey and mapping technology and including participation of the community, in particular women and disadvantaged groups; 
(ii) 	the participatory determination, geographic delineation and physical demarcation of village boundaries in targeted sub-districts (kecamatan) of selected districts; 
(iii)	identification and resolution, as possible, of land use and tenure disputes; and
(iv)	the collection of geo-spatial data and mapping of critical natural and cultural resource areas within the mapped villages.	
2)	Creation of sub-district (kecamatan) level land use inventories and integration of land and other natural resource information, including:
(i) 	compilation of and georeferencing of existing and pending licenses and permits for land and natural resource use, other use rights, community claims, and select biophysical data and creation of sub-district level land use inventories;
(ii) 	technical assistance to relevant provincial and district government agencies to support integration, management and exchange of geo-spatial data and to make land information widely available to the public . 
3)	Capacity building for spatial planning and resource management at the provincial and district government level enhancement of district spatial plans, including:
(i)	investments in computer and mapping equipment, GIS software, training and technical assistance for provincial and district Bappeda offices and the office of the Bupati, to improve spatial analysis and the use, updating and enforcement of spatial plans; and improve effectiveness and transparency in licensing, permitting and decisions on land use.";"";"";"IDN";"climate change;customary law;customary tenure;eviction;fisheries;forest land;indigenous land rights;indigenous peoples;land access;land acquisitions;land administration;land conflicts;land dispute;land dispute resolution;land governance;land investments;land law;land markets;land ownership;land policies;land rights;land tenure;land tenure systems;land transfers;land use planning;legal empowerment;public ownership;research;security of tenure (land);state property;women";"Land Conflicts;Land & Gender;Land in Post-Conflict Settings;Land, Climate Change & Environment;Land & Investments;Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"2013-04-30";"2018-04-30";"USD";"43100000";"43100000";"http://www.mca-indonesia.go.id/";"Eric Trachtenberg, MCC, +1-202-521-7243 <TrachtenbergEB@mcc.gov>";"";"USAID";"Millennium Challenge Account - Indonesia";"Global Donor Platform for Rural Development"
