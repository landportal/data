Inclusion encompasses indigenous/minority communities active participation in the decision making processes of planned, or on-going, extractive enterprises that have the potential to negatively impact their lands, societies, livelihoods, and biodiversity.  Enhancing the ability of people, communities, and local/regional governments to address complicated issues surrounding extractive activities directly works towards USAID’s mission to (1) build local sustainability and partnerships, (2) foster innovation, and (3) strengthen USAID’s capacity to deliver results.  Extractive activities primarily refer to mining (alluvial and hard-rock) and hydrocarbon enterprises.  A key focus of this project will be strengthening organizations, including applied research centers that work on preventing and mitigating conflicts arising over extractive activities.  Developing and disseminating applicable tools for improved conflict management is a project priority.
Select South and Central American countries have been identified as priorities for USAID conflict alleviation work in the LA region; this project will therefore focus primarily on these LA sub-regions.  During the first two years of project implementation, the project will focus on Guatemala, Colombia and Peru; complementing LA bilateral Mission work in the area of conflict management.";https://www.land-links.org/project/addressing-biodiversity-social-conflict-in-latin-america/;8,9,21,23,25

To date, in these countries, like in most others, the focus of REDD+ efforts has been on deforestation and to a lesser extent forest degradation. Accordingly, there is a matching deficiency in guidance material and national approaches to forest carbon stock enhancement as part of the REDD+ Strategy.
This project aims to advance understanding of forest carbon stock enhancement as part of any future REDD+ Agreement through exploring the technical and economic feasibility of different forest carbon stock enhancement strategies in pilot sites, across Vietnam and Lao PDR. The sites will be chosen to reflect representative forest ecosystems of the region. The results and operational guidance will feed into the National REDD+ Strategies, which will ensure their replication across the respective countries. The project also aims to better understand the economic feasibility of different options and the incentives which need to be in place to engage local communities and improve their living conditions.
To bring the results to a wider audience, publications, regional and international workshops and communications platforms will be used to disseminate the lessons to the many individuals working on REDD+ and interested in advancing understanding of Forest Carbon Stock Enhancement as part of REDD+.

This will result in the registration of legitimate existing land rights, as mapped and validated in the first step, as well as the registration of “new” land rights which emanate from and are defined in the participatory planning process. These land rights can accrue to individuals as well as to groups of people, and are an important step towards securing the remaining commonage in the interest of more marginalised rural residents, as well as creating a conducive environment for private investments on the land. Planning for, and investments in infrastructure developments, will explore a mix of potential interventions which make provisions for different ownership, management and land use options to stimulate diversification options.

Data for Sustainable Development Goals;Norway;Kyrgyzstan;Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs;Norwegian Mapping Authority;;2017-01-01;2020-12-01;USD 1,200,000;"This is a project where the Norwegian Mapping Authority, SSB and our respective counterparts in Kyrgyzstan will work together in a joint effort to further improve the efficiency of the Kyrgyz institutions, especially in the field of using maps and register information for production and dissemination of statistics. Experience from Norway has shown that both types of organisations gain from working together, and monitoring and reporting on the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires cooperation between data owners, producers of maps and producers of statistics.

Background

SRS/DCR has spearheaded major reforms to the land sector in Kyrgyzstan. Impressively, it takes only one day to register a sale or a mortgage. However, there is no solution for distribution of maps via Internet, which is vital for statistical purposes. Maps are currently not easily available and used for preparation of statistics in Kyrgyzstan. Kartverket, SRS and DCR will work closely together with Statistics Norway (SSB) and the National Statistical Committee of Kyrgyzstan (NSC) to integrate geospatial data to serve statistical needs in line with Objective 3.4 of the Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data.

Kyrgyzstan also lacks up-to-date photomaps. The current photomaps in use are made in 2002 and do not show changes that occurred since that time. There is an urgent need for new photomaps that are produced from aerial imagery.  Likewise, up-to-date line maps in vector form do not currently exist. Such maps are especially needed for Bishkek.   

The project will ensure access to maps via a national Geoportal (to be developed in the project), inter alia, to provide geographic data for statistical purposes. A main goal of the project is to prepare geographic data (maps) needed for production of statistical data supporting implementation and reporting on Sustainable Development Goals for Kyrgyzstan.  This project should be considered as a component to a well-coordinated and integrated effort on strengthening the capabilities of Kyrgyz governmental institutions to provide maps and statistical data for sustainable development. The coordinated efforts will also facilitate use of the various registers at the State Registration Service for production of statistics.

Activities

1.Making geographic information available for statistical purposes:
?Collection of existing maps to support statistics nationwide. Existing maps will be collected, analyzed, upgraded if needed, and stored in a format suitable for distribution online via the geoportal, inter alia, to be used for statistical purposes
?Development of principles, standards and procedures for data sharing between respective data-holders in Kyrgyzstan.
?Development of a geoportal for distribution of data. The activity will start with specifying the requirements.

2.Production of photomaps and line maps: ?Aerial photography and photomap production for 20 000 km2 including Bishkek and surrounding areas, settlements around Issyk-Kul Lake and in Fergana Valley.
?Preparation of line maps for Bishkek, 150 km2. The line maps will be prepared using the same aerial images as prepared for the photomaps. 
?Quality control of deliverables. All data delivered is subject to quality control, which will be executed by SRS/DCR assisted by Kartverket and with potential support from the State Geodetic Institute in Kyrgyzstan “Goskartographia”.
?Development of a solution for efficient distribution of photomaps online via the geoportal.

3.Capacity building, public awareness campaign ?A number of training courses for technical personnel will be held in Norway and Kyrgyzstan, supporting all activities of the project
?Public awareness campaign will promote the institutional cooperation between Kyrgyz authorities on sharing data and making data available for distribution via the geoportal as well as targeting users of geo-information.";;3A,3B,4,5,6,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,25

Existing customary land rights and infrastructure will be mapped and registered in a designated Namibian Communal Land Administration System (NCLAS). The information provided by this system will be used during the planning phase where, depending on the complexity of an area, an Integrated Regional Land Use Plan (IRLUP) or initially only a Local Level Participatory Plan (LLPP) will be developed. This will result in the registration of legitimate existing land rights, as mapped and validated in the first step, as well as the registration of “new” land rights which emanate from and are defined in the participatory planning process. These land rights can accrue to individuals as well as to groups of people, and are an important step towards securing the remaining commonage in the interest of more marginalised rural residents, as well as creating a conducive environment for private investments on the land. Planning for, and investments in infrastructure developments, will explore a mix of potential interventions which make provisions for different ownership, management and land use options to stimulate diversification options. Advisory services will strengthen both the planning phase, as well as the optimal utilisation of the infrastructure investments in order foster the integration of rural communities in the mainstream economy.;;

Background

The LAKI II project approved for EEA funding 2009 -2014 focused on production of maps and photomaps, as well as on establishment of detailed terrain model using laser scanning, for about 50 000 km2. This project (LAKI III) will focus on preparation of a digital terrain model for larger parts of Romania related to prevention and mitigation of floods. Due to limited financial resources NACLR does not have a digital terrain model of high/average precision, required to achieve cartography, topography, geodesy, photogrammetry and remote sensing in the entire country.

The overall objective is to enhance the capacity of NACRL to prepare geographic information needed for environmental monitoring and reporting, for dealing with effects of climate change, for integrated planning and for implementation of the EU Directive on harmonization and exchange of geographic information domestically and across national borders. New data for significant parts of the country will be produced, including environmentally sensitive areas and flood risk areas. The project will improve public access to geographic data via Internet, inter alia, to support the implementation of development and environmental policies.

In the future, RGA will manage their key registers in a new service oriented architecture (eliminating redundant storage of data, ensuring that registers are updated continuously directly form the data sources.)



Background and Justification

RGA and Kartverket have for more than 10 years cooperated in projects on improving the Serbian infrastructure of geographic information and land management, among the project results are:
•Scanning and transfer of old cadastral maps to digital data
•Establishment of a Digital Archive for Land Administration Data
•Developing strategy and realizing cooperation between stakeholders of geographic information in Serbia
•Realization of a web portal for exchange of map data and geographic information
•Specifications of a new Real Estate management system (cooperation with the World Bank)
•Assessment the quality of property information (Data Migration Pilot - ongoing)

In the same period there has been significant developments having impact on the operation of RGA:
•Serbia have launched an e-Government program and are developing a number of services for digital interaction between the public, businesses and public institutions.
•The European Union has implemented a series of standards under the INSPIRE directive framework, obliging public institutions to make geographic information available on standardized formats and services.

This project focuses on upgrading the key registers of RGA enabling integration with the Serbian e-Government, also enabling INSPIRE compliant services for geographic information. 

Project Objectives

The overall objective is to support RGAs role as an online provider of property-, and geographic information to enable realization of efficient e-Government services, and European Standardisation. More specifically:
1.To establish three new registers (Addresses, Administrative Units and Condominiums) as an integrated part of the RGA key registers, communicate with external data through services, and support the e-government of Serbia.
2.To make geographic information available to the private and public enterprises as well as the citizens with geoportal and services that comply with the INSPIRE directive of EU.
3.To integrate the new registers with services with other registers both internally and externally to RGA, thus maintaining continuous and coordinated updating and efficient work processes.";;3A,3B,4,5,6,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,25

Each specific theme holds a range of indicators that are ranked to measure performance. Based on these performances, countries are able to identify and prioritize areas in need of reform.";;3A,5,6,8,16,17,18,19,20,21

Maps for good land governance;Norway;Ukraine;Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs;Norwegian Mapping Authority;;2017-01-01;2020-12-01;USD 4,400,000;"This project aims at establishing a public service for precise use of GPS technology for surveying and mapping, and a digital base map for the whole territory of Ukraine including occupied areas, with a data content and accuracy equivalent to scale 1:50 000. This corresponds to what exists in most other European countries. 

Challenges and justification for project

Ukraine has a territory of 603.000 km2, of which as much as 2/3 are arable land. Sustainable land management is crucial to economic development. Maps are indispensable for land- and territorial management as well as for many other purposes in public and private sectors. Up-to-date maps are available for 20 % only, and these maps are not integrated into a user oriented electronic service. For the remaining 80 % there are only old maps from the Soviet time.

Maps are not easily available to users in Ukraine. As in most other European countries, basic maps should be made available on the Internet and harmonized with other thematic data, according to the concept of National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). Despite that Ukraine is not an EU member, the Government wants to implement their NSDI in accordance with the EU Inspire directive.

Activities
1.Preparation of digital map for the whole territory of Ukraine and a solution for distribution of the maps for good governance, land use planning and sustainable land management, as well as for implementation and reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals.
2.Establishing a network of ground stations needed for a public service supporting precise use of GPS technology for boundary surveys, etc. building on the previous project.

Components
1.Produce new maps using satellite images to update existing old maps. This will include making a product specification to ensure that the data is structured for optimal use, and will include verification and upgrading of the data model for the database, which will hold the maps.
2.The second component of the project is to integrate the existing digital maps and the updated old maps into a single seamless database.
3.The third component is to establish a solution for efficient access to the maps and satellite images for all users in Ukraine. This should be done in accordance with the concept of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure, in line with European standards outlined in the EU INSPIRE directive and adjacent standards and guidelines. This will lead to a more transparent and efficient land administration in Ukraine.
4.The fourth component of the project is to establish a network of ground stations and a related public service (Ukrainian Positioning System = UAPOS), supporting precise use of GPS technology. It is proposed to start the establishment of UAPOS with 90 reference stations, prioritizing areas with the most intensive development and active land market, and with a central control facility at the SALR premises in Kiev. A business plan for the service will also be developed to ensure sustainability. The system will improve the surveying and mapping of parcel boundaries, thus improving public services to the emerging markets in land and reduce conflicts over ownership, which is a massive problem after restitution of private ownership to land. This corresponds to the situation in Norway and in many other European countries, where the State operates a high quality and strictly controlled service in addition to private positioning services.
5.The fifth component of the project is training, capacity building and awareness raising. The training focuses on improving the capacity of the StateGeoCadastre to efficiently implement all activities of the project. Awareness campaigns will focus on informing public institutions and other users about the availability of maps and related terms for use. Such maps are an indispensable information resource for good governance, and are urgently needed for many purposes in Ukraine; inter alia, for land management, environmental planning and reporting, for improvements to infrastructure, for water management, for adaptation and mitigation of effects of climate change, as well as for a wide range of other usage at all levels of public sector, and in private sector.";;3A,5,6,8,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,25

The Project will improve access to spatial information and thus possibilities for inter-agency cooperation and public participation in environmental and other spatial planning and management processes. Easy access to spatial information is a precondition for private sector involvement in economic development, participatory democracy, good governance (transparency), reduction of inequalities and fair sharing of benefits from natural resources, which all contribute to poverty reduction. More efficient data sharing will create savings by reducing duplication of work by various agencies. In particular, accurate coastal and marine spatial data also support the planning of adaptation to climate change, which is imperative for small islands communities like Zanzibar. The project lasts for 3 years from 2016-2018 and its budget is 719 000 €.

This project will identify and register established individuals and families who are making use of land inside the park but do not have legal documents to support their tenure. he cadastral survey, which will be finalizedon December 2013, will involve the following steps: conducting a census of the communities established inside the nucleus zone of Celaque National Park, mapping and georeferencing the plots of land currently used by the communities, and elaborating a database of land use and occupancy. To execute this project, MAPANCE PROCELAQUE and USAID ProParque will work closely with the municipalities of Belén Gualcho and San Manuel Colohete, whose jurisdictions include the communities to be surveyed, as well as the Institute of Forestry Conservation and Development (ICF), the Honduras Property Institute (IP) and the National Agrarian Institute (INA). These institutions will collaborate to determine the validity of each family’s land claim and when they got established in those lands.

PRADD and PRADD II were developed to support country compliance with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The overarching goal of PRADD and PRADD II are to increase the percentage of diamonds entering the legal chain of custody, while improving the livelihoods of artisanal diamond mining communities. PRADD II is financed through a Congressional Earmark in support of the Clean Diamond Trade Act and managed by USAID’s Land Tenure and Property Rights Division within the E3 Bureau. The LTPR Division closely coordinates with the US Department of State and US Geological Survey who also provide support to the KPCS.  
PRADD II will continue to be a landmark program for the United States Government (USG), the Kimberley Process and the development community at large. PRADD was one of the first and largest development projects concentrated on the Kimberley Process and artisanal diamond mining challenges. Significantly, PRADD has been instrumental in helping the KPCS modify its goals from a narrow focus on traceability, regulation and enforcement systems to a broader focus recognizing the role of economic development in bringing rough diamonds into legitimate chains of custody, and consequently better addressing the challenges of conflict diamonds. This transition is demonstrated by the recent adoption of the Washington Declaration (http://usaidlandtenure.net/pradd/washington-declaration) at the 2012 Kimberley Process Plenary meetings that occurred in November in Washington, DC. Due to the limited number of development institutions and experiences in the artisanal mining sector, PRADD II will continue to test and evaluate approaches to achieving its objectives while also consolidating program successes, to encourage other donors and governments to implement PRADD-type programs to achieve KPCS objectives.";https://land-links.org/document/program-brief-pradd-ii/;5,6,9,11,12,16,17,20,21,25

As we know, the effects of climate change and mitigation of the effects are not confined to national borders and increasing regional cooperation among the actors involved in managing these issues would only be beneficial. 



Background

Through the Norwegian Mapping Authority, the Government of Norway has for many years assisted countries in the Western Balkan region in preparing geographic information and in establishing services ensuring access to the information.

The partner institutions are (with some variation) functioning satisfactorily, but lack funds to prepare up-to-date geographic information, and access to this type of information for their respective land and sea territories is limited. Data to deal with the effects of climate change is a special challenge, and partner institutions are also challenged with meeting European standards on access to geographic information. Because of the socialist legacy, partner institutions still need to improve their register services for the emerging land markets in privatised properties.

The overall goal of this regional project is improved governance on central, regional and local levels; sustainable land use; secure land markets; and safe navigation at sea.

Activities
•For Bosnia and Herzegovina, activities will focus on 1) Roll-out of a digital archive system, and 2) Improvments to the system for efficient use of GPS technology.

The main objective of the project is to obtain more exploitation of oil from existing reservoirs. As part of the project, assistance using GIS for departments under the Ministry of Petroleum and Gas is included. 



Purpose

The Oil for Development (OfD) Programme offers assistance to developing countries in their efforts to manage petroleum resources in a sustainable manner. Oil and gas play an important role in an increasing number of developing countries, and have the potential to generate economic and social development. In several cases, however, it has proven difficult to translate the resource into improved welfare for citizens of those countries. Through the OfD Programme, Norway shares its experience from five decades of managing oil and gas resources. Some key characteristics of the Norwegian experience are strategic ownership by the state, strong and competent institutions, continual accumulation of technical knowledge, an advanced regulatory system with high respect for the environment, health and safety, and perhaps above all – society’s determination to secure national control over its petroleum resources.

NPD will in the OfD Programme cooperate with Ministry of Petroleum and Gas (MOPG) in Sudan within the project “Sustainable Development & Management of the Petroleum Sector in Sudan”. One component in the project is a Geographical Information System (GIS). The Norwegian Mapping Authority will contribute with deliverables on behalf of NPD within GIS data management.

The main target of the project is to implement a sustainable infrastructure for acquiring, maintaining and distributing spatial data, including:
•Spatial Data management
•Standardization of data and exchange
•GIS and Imaging Tools
•Distribution tools including web portal and web services
•Human resource skills, knowledge and capacity to manage, maintain and enhance the infrastructure

Activities

The project is divided into three phases:
1.Phase 1 involves creating data models for the spatial data, creating a data repository, implementing a GIS tool, and publishing a standard for the spatial data (for its’ content, structure and exchange).
2.Phase 2 involves creating a web portal for viewing, browsing and basic capture of spatial data; implementing image processing and management tools; and establishing web services for stakeholders.
3.Phase 3 involves setting up online communication channels for stakeholders; enhancing GIS functionality for analysis; and ensuring that an infrastructure for spatial data is operative";;3A,3B,5,6,12,20,21,22,25

Swarna Pragati makes financing more accessible to individuals in these areas by not requiring a title to guarantee a loan and by assessing the borrower’s creditworthiness using a unique, non-traditional methodology.";;

Therefore, the project seeks to support the implementation of the land tenure policy and law.

The project will also strengthen land security processes through: (i) diagnostic land tenure studies linked to the revision of Commune Development Plans; (ii) the elaboration of land tenure charters; (iii) elaboration of land tenure charters (chartes foncieres locales) and other documentation provided for by the Rural Land Legislation such as registration of usufruct rights (attestation de possession fonciere rurale); (iv) the regularization of land set aside for investment by the local government; and (v) strengthening the capacity of local actors to conciliate disputes related to land tenure. Given the preponderance of local disputes linked to land issues - including titling, pastoral vs. agricultural usage, and crop destruction - the component will also provide specific training modules on conflict resolution.

The analysis revealed that land abandonment is a complex multi-dimensional process with interlinked economic, environmental, social factors causing it. The inability to irrigate (due to infrastructure constraints, economic constraints or for any other reasons) was found to be among the main drivers of land abandonment in Armenia. Thus, the multiple causality of land abandonment requires a coordinated policy response between agricultural policy, land policy and improvements in the irrigation sector.
