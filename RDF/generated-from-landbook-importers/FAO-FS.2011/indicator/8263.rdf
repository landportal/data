    <skos:definition>This indicator is part of the FAO Suite of Food Security Indicators (2011) in the dimension &amp;quot;access&amp;quot;. It is conceptually analogous to the prevalence of undernourishment , but calculated setting the caloric threshold to a higher level, by using a Physical Activity Level (PAL) coefficient of 1.75, as opposed to 1.55. It measures the percentage of the population that is at risk of not covering the food requirements associated with normal physical activity, and therefore including also those who, even though cannot be considered chronically undernourished, are likely being conditioned in their economic activity by insufficient food. While the PoU is an estimator of chronic food deprivation (“hunger”), this new estimator is a less conservative measure of food inadequacy in the population. The indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1990-92 to 2014-16, to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated DES, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.</skos:definition>
