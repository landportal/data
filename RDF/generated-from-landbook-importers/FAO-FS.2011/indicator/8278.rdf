    <skos:definition>This indicator (originally measured by the WHO) is part of the FAO Suite of Food Security Indicators (2011) in the dimension &amp;quot;utilization&amp;quot;. The prevalence of iodine deficiency is the proportion of school children aged 6 to 12 years of age showing urinary iodine equal or lower than 100 ?g/l. An estimated 35% of the world’s population has insufficient iodine intake and continues to live at risk of iodine deficiency and associated disorders. Iodine deficiency poses a threat throughout the lifecycle and has been associated with mental impairment and goitre in older children and adults, and complications with pregnancy, including stillbirth and congenital anomalies. Inadequate iodine intake during pregnancy may lead to irreversible fetal brain damage. The cut-off values for public health significance is 20%. A prevalence of Iodine deficiency equal or higher than this level signals a severe public health problem.</skos:definition>
