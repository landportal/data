    <skos:definition>This indicator is part of the FAO Suite of Food Security Indicators (2011) in the dimension &amp;quot;utilization&amp;quot;. The Indicator shows the percentage of adults who are underweight, as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) below the international reference standard of 18.5.
