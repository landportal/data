    <dct:title>Coastal waters used for aquac. or holding facilities</dct:title>
    <skos:definition>Area of Coastal waters used for marine aquaculture facilities including supporting facilities. Aquaculture facilities include enclosures and pens (water areas confined by net, mesh and other barriers allowing uncontrolled water interchange), cages (open or covered enclosed structure constructed with net, mesh or any porous materials allowing natural water interchange), barrages (semi-permanent or seasonal enclosures formed by impervious man-made barriers and appropriate natural features) and rafts, ropes and stakes (raft, long lines or stakes used to culture shellfish and seaweeds). This category includes: Oyster beds and other types of shellfish (mussels, clams, abalones and scallops) Bodies of water used for seaweed production Bodies of water used for fish rearing</skos:definition>
