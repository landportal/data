    <skos:definition>Women who own land alone (% of women age 15-49) is the percentage of women age 15-49 who only solely own a land which is legally registered with their name or cannot be sold without their signature. Women who own land alone is the number of women age 15-49 who say the only type of land they own is the one they own alone or don't share ownership with anyone, expressed as percentage of women age 15-49 who have been interviewed and It’s derived by dividing the number of women age 15-49 who responded they alone own a land, which legally registered with their name or can’t be sold without their signature, by total number of women age 15-49 who have been interviewed. ‘Ownership’ implies that the land is legally registered in the woman’s name or, since official property records do not always exist or are not maintained, the land is recognized as hers and cannot be sold without her signature or equivalent. ‘land’ includes all agricultural or non-agricultural land. Non-agricultural land refers to rural land that is not used for growing crops, and most land in urban areas.    </skos:definition>
