    <skos:definition>This indicator is part of the FAO Suite of Food Security Indicators (2017) in the dimension &amp;quot;stability&amp;quot;. The cereal imports dependency ratio tells how much of the available domestic food supply of cereals has been imported and how much comes from the country&amp;#039;s own production. It is computed as (cereal imports - cereal exports)/(cereal production + cereal imports - cereal exports) * 100. Given this formula the indicator assumes only values &amp;lt;= 100. Negative values indicate that the country is a net exporter of cereals. This indicator provides a measure of the dependence of a country or region from cereal imports. The greater the indicator, the higher the dependence. The indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1990-92 to 2009-11, to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated production and trade, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.</skos:definition>
