    <skos:definition>This indicator is part of the FAO Suite of Food Security Indicators (2017) in the dimension &quot;utilization&quot;. This indicator measures the percentage of overweight (weight-for-height more than 2 standard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards median) among children aged 0-5 years. This indicator belongs to a set of indicators whose purpose is to measure nutritional imbalance and malnutrition resulting in undernutrition (assessed by underweight, stunting and wasting) and overweight. Child growth is the most widely used indicator of nutritional status in a community and is internationally recognized as an important public-health indicator for monitoring health in populations. In addition, children who suffer from growth retardation as a result of poor diets and/or recurrent infections tend to have a greater risk of suffering illness and death. World Health Organization, Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition. Country-level data are unadjusted data from national surveys, and thus may not be comparable across countries. Adjusted, comparable data are available at http://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/en. Aggregation is based on UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank harmonized dataset (adjusted, comparable data) and methodology. Original data can be retrieved from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.OWGH.ZS)</skos:definition>
