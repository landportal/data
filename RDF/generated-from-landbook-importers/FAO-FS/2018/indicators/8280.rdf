    <skos:definition>This indicator is part of the FAO Suite of Food Security Indicators (2017) in the dimension &amp;quot;availability&amp;quot;. This indicator measures the national average protein supply (expressed in grams per caput per day). This indicator provides information on the quality of the diet. This indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1990-92 to 2011-13, to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated DES, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.</skos:definition>
